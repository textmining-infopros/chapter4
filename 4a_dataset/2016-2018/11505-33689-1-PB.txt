This paper provides an insight of  actual use of mobile devices by into LIS students’ in everyday life and their  perceptions regarding the usefulness and effectiveness of mobile phones for academic purpose in Central universities  in Uttar Pradesh state, India. The fndings of the study reveal that most of the respondents use mobile devices daily  for more than 3 hours. Smart phone is the most used mobile device. Respondents use productivity tools on their  mobile device for creating documents. Gmail app, Whatsapp, google app, adobe reader and PDF viewer are the most  frequently used mobile apps. Most of the respondents access Library Website through their mobile device and only  1.96% are accessing e-books from their mobile device. Major barriers found are: use of mobile devices for academic  learning in the poor network coverage, high charging data plans, slow load time and lack of Internet speed. The  fndings of the study will not only guide LIS students in effective use of mobile devices for academic purposes, but  will also help mobile manufactures, university authorities, librarians in exploring mobile devices adoption and usage  
among the respondents.

1. IntroDUCtIon 
A  mobile  device  is  a  portable,  wireless  computing  device that is small enough to be used while held in the  hand. The mobile devices are reshaping students everyday  lives in diverse ways, especially by delivering content in  versatile forms. The developments in mobile technology  have  led  to  the  use  of  mobile  devices  for  educational  purposes  and  the  development  of  the  concept  of  using  mobile learning (M-Learning). Mobile learning in simple  words is defined as the use of portable devices equipped  with internet facility in the learning process. M-Learning  facilitates  the  students  to  learn,  collaborate,  and  share  their  ideas  with  each  other  in  short  time  using  internet  and technology. As a result, ‘many educational researchers  are  exploring  the  potential  for  mobile  technologies  to  enhance student learning, with mobile learning becoming  one  of  the  fastest  growing  areas  within  the  field  of  ICTs  in  education’1.  If  mobile  technologies  are  to  be  effectively  used  for  educational  purpose,  study  and  teaching,  first  and  foremost  question  becomes  how  do  we  best  use  mobile  technologies  for  teaching  and  learning? In addressing this, the first step is to find out  how  students  are  using  mobile  technologies  to  support  their  learning. The  present  study  investigates  the  extent  to which Library and Information Science (LIS) students  currently have access to mobile technologies and whether  they  are  using  these  to  support  their  learning.

deliver  content  in  versatile  forms.  ‘Mobile  technologies  enable  learners  to  access  relevant  information  anytime  and  anywhere.  It  facilitates  easy  and  timely  access  to  information. Moreover, mobile devices facilitate students  to learn, collaborate, and share ideas among each other.  Therefore,  these  devices  are  now  used  by  students  to  support  their  study  and  learning  too.  Because,  students  use  mobile  phones  to  communicate  with  classmates,  search for information, access learning materials, generate  contents, record presentations and take notes2  and  easy,  more  accessible,  faster  and  time-saving.  
Students  perceived  that  mobile  devices  are  useful  and  convenient  for  instant  access  to  various  sources  of  information,  for  taking  notes,  sharing  their  research  and ideas; despite some facilitator concerns that mobile  devices are potentially distracting in face-to-face Problem  Based Learning Tutorials3. The majority of students own  smartphones and they rarely make use of the mobile devices  for academic purposes4  and communication purposes 
5.  But,  less popular is reading academic journals and e-books6.  LIS students extensively use their smartphones for their  daily needs to read casual literature like books, comics,  magazines, etc.6, 7  and similar number of students engage  themselves  in  listening  to  music  while  studying8. 
Laptops  are  the  most  often  used  mobile  device  for  learning and study9, whereas, Smartphones have recently  become  cheaper  and  more  common  among  students  in  higher  education10   and  have  a  positive  attitude  towards  the academic use11  for m-learning to improve their social  interactions, mostly through Academic Social Networking  Sites  to  search  other  research  scholars.  Sending  emails,

accessing  e-newspapers  and  searching  the  Web  OPAC  (Online  Public  Access  Catalogue)  is  the  most  frequent  activity5. On the other hand, a large number of students  use smartphones, especially for  communication purposes,  as  most  of  the  apps  on  communication  apps  including  Facebook,  E-mail,  Twitter,  WhatsApp,  youTube,  and  Viber12. 
The  use  of  mobile  technology  to  enhance  learning  experience  for  m-learning13   and  related  activities  like  discussing assignments, accessing resources, news from the  course learning platform, checking course emails, etc’14  and  enhanced students’ levels of learning language skills and  sub-skills, including listening, reading, and vocabulary15. On the other hand, the lack of the mobile version website  constitutes a significant barrier in m-learning16  and cost  related  to  the  use  of  mobile  devices  in  the  classroom  is  associated with the Internet15. The  idea  of  using  mobile  devices  for  providing  library  services  is  a  new  and  innovative  idea  in  India.  Wang,  Ke  &  Lu17   said  that  libraries  are  adopting  mobile  technologies  to  provide  new  and  innovative  services,  as  well  as  introducing  ways  for  users  to  incorporate  library  services  into  their  daily  lives. 
Pazur18   observed  that  library  users  are  definitely  interested  in  accessing  library  services  and  resources  through small screen devices and that some of them are  even aware of new directions in searching of information.  Libraries  can  deliver  the  following  services  via  mobile  devices:  Mobile  OPAC,  Training  via  mobile,  Library  databases delivered via mobile, Providing notification in  the form of SMS (Short Message Service) via mobile19,20.  Bicen & Kocakoyun21   found  that  students  checked  their  mobile  devices  on  an  average  31  times  a  day,  but  not  very  much  for  the  educational  purposes  and  for  searching library catalogues or subscription databases22.  Students  are  using  mobile  technology  for  meeting  their  everyday  needs  as  well  as  the  academic  needs.  It  has  been possible because of the benefits that these devices  offer;  from  clicking  photos  to  uploading  and  sharing  them,  to  searching  library  resources  without  time  and  place  constraints. 
Portability  is  a  great  advantage  of  using  a  mobile  device. Instant and quick access to a variety of resources  via mobile was another benefit and availability of specially  designed  mobile  applications23,24.  Mobile  devices  can  also  serve  as  a  powerful  data  collection  tools  and  also  facilitate the capture of user created content25.  Some  of  the  most  obvious  and  direct  benefits  of  mobile  learning  are  equal-opportunity  access,  ubiquitous  connectivity,  multigenerational  users  and  uses,  expanded  services  for  mobile workers and enhanced access to services for mobile  learners26.  There  is  no  doubt  that  mobile  devices  offer  innovative  ways  to  students  for  learning  and  enhancing  their  learning  experience  through  m-learning.  Like  any  other technology, mobile devices are also prone to certain  issues  and  technical  difficulties,  such  as  problematic  Wi-Fi  or  Internet  connectivity,  slow  processing  of  data,  
288 
short battery life, small screen, limited storage capacities  and  safety/security  and  consequences  associated  with  a  stolen  or  lost  mobile  device23. 
Dukic,  Chiu  &  Lo14   found  the  small  size  of  the  smartphone screen as a major barrier that makes it difficult  to read academic papers and also to write and edit longer  texts. Another  barrier  for  many  respondents  is  that  web  pages  are  not  always  formatted  for  smartphone.  Slow  load time also discourages to study. Course materials are  rarely optimised for use on smartphones, and interacting  with  other  students  is  often  impractical  using  smart  phones7  and lack of teaching and learning models 
27.The  privacy, security28   lack  of  Internet  speed,  authentication  of  e-resources,  slow  load  time  and  small  screen  size  to  be  prominent  problems  associated  with  the  mobile  device  use5. 
3.    StAteMent  of  ProbLeM 
Advancement in mobile technology has given ubiquity  and  mobility  to  its  users.  Ubiquity  is  the  ability  to  access  technology  by  the  computing  devices  24x7  from  anywhere,  where  mobility  is  the  ability  to  access  while  on the go, such as smart phones, tablets, e-book readers,  etc. LIS students are the future library professionals and  it  is  very  important  for  them  to  become  techno-savvy,  so that when they move to work environments they may  better help to implement these in the library environment.  The  present  research  study  investigates  the  extent  to  which  LIS  students  have  access  to  mobile  technologies  and  whether  they  are  using  these  mobile  devices  to  support  their  learning. The  main  goal  of  the  study  is  to  provide an insight into LIS students’ actual use of smart  phones  for  learning  and  their  perceptions  regarding  the  usefulness and effectiveness of mobile devices. This study  also  explores  how  LIS  students  use  their  smart  phone  in  everyday  life  and  for  learning  purposes.

The  main  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: (a) Identify  the  use  of  Mobile  devices  by  library  and  
Information  Science  (LIS)  students  for  everyday  
communication,  entertainment    and    information  
needs 
(b) Know  the  use  of  Mobile  devices  by  LIS  students  
for  learning  purpose 
(c) Ascertain  the  use  of  Mobile  devices  for  accessing  
library  resources  and    services,  and 
(d) Find  out  the  risks  and  problems  associated  with  
Mobile  devices. 
The scope of the present study is restricted to students  (BLIS,  and  MLIS,)  and  research  scholars  (MPhil  and  PhD)  pursuing  their  Library  and  Information  Science  courses  in  the  different  Central  Universities  in  Uttar  Pradesh state, India. The study confined to three central  universities, namely (i) Aligarh Muslim University (AMU),  Aligarh  (ii)  Baba  Sahib  Bhimrao  Ambedkar  University

(BBAU),  Lucknow,  and  (iii)  Banaras  Hindu  University  (BHU),  Varanasi.  The  selection  of  the  universities  was  done  on  the  basis  of  existing  LIS  courses  offered  in  regular  mode  in  universities. 
5. MethoDoLogy 
To  solicit  information  about  use  of  mobile  devices,  a  structured  questionnaire  was  designed,  comprising  of  20 different type of questions, such as dichotomous (yes/ no), multiple choice, and opinion questions, to elicit their  experience.  Questionnaires  circulated  personally  among  250  LIS  students  in  three  Central  Universities  of  Uttar  Pradesh  state,  India  during  the  survey  period  (March  to  April 2016) and received 153 filled-in questionnaires.The  response rate was 61.2 per cent. The responses received  from  the  respondents  to  20  questions  are  presented  in  the  form  of  tables  and  figures  and  analysed  by  using  a  simple  mathematical  calculations.

6.1. Demographic  Details 
Gender  is  a  matter  of  consideration  when  we  talk  about  use  of  mobile  devices.  Usage  of  mobile  devices  is significantly influenced by gender. Table 1 show that  male  respondents  outnumber  females  in  use  of  mobile  devices.  Kopackova  &  Bilkova29   gave  an  ‘interesting  finding  regarding  the  ownership  of  smartphones.  More  than 80% of students owned smartphone and male/female  ratio  was  surprisingly  balanced’. 
Age plays a vital role in the use of mobile devices.  The age of the respondents covered in the study has been  grouped  into  4  categories,  viz.,  ≤20  years,  21-25  years,  26-30 years and ≥30 years (Table.1). Table 1 shows that  majority  of  respondents  with  age  between  21-25  years  use  mobile  devices  more,  followed  by  those  having  age  between  26–30  years  (28.11%),  and  very  few  LIS  students are under  20 years (1.96%) along with research  scholars  (0.65%)  above  30  years  of  age.

Out of 153 respondents, 54.90% are from M.L.I.Sc.,  followed by PhD research scholars with 29.41 %, B.L.I.Sc.,  with  12.42%  and  MPhil  3.27%.  It  is  clear  from  the  figure  that  MLIS,  students  dominate  in  number,  it  is  due to the reason that B.B.A.U. and B.H.U. do not offer  BLIS,  course. 
6.2. Use  of  Mobile  Devices 
M-learning  is  a  new  concept  and  this  concept  has  evolved because of the advancements in mobile technology  that has given rise to so many different types and models  of  mobile  devices  with  diverse  features.  Students  use  these devices for everyday information needs as well as  for academic needs. They have become an indispensable  part  of  human  life. 
Table  2  reveals  that  all  the  respondents  are  using  mobile  devices.  While  taking  account  of  use  of  mobile  devices,  it  is  very  important  to  find  out  what  are  the  different types of mobile devices that the LIS students use  for fulfilling their information needs. Smartphone is the  most  used  mobile  device  (92.15%),  followed  by  Laptop  (61.44%) and Tablet (16.34%). It is clear from the e-book  reader  that  Table  is  the  most-less  used  mobile  device.  Similar  findings  had  been  reported  by  Farley7,  et  al., that  less  than  5%  students  either  don’t  have  access  to  smartphones  or  don’t  use  them  and  smartphone  is  the  most used mobile device. Hernandez, Vegas & Llamas8 also  stressed  on  this  fact  that  ‘smartphone  are  the  most  used  mobile  devices  among  university  students’. 
Period since using mobile devices is also an important  factor when studying the use of mobile devices. Maximum  percentage  is  of  the  students  using  the  mobile  devices  for  more  than  3  years  with  60.13%,  thereafter  using  since  2-3  years  with  18.30%,  1-2  years  with  9.15%,  less  than  6  months  with  7.19%  and  7  months  to  a  year  with  5.23%. 
It can be seen from Table 2 that 96.73% respondents  daily  use  the  mobile  devices.  The  finding  of  the  study  in  consistent  with  Bicen  &  Kocakoyun21   reported  that  ‘students  check  their  mobile  devices  31  times  a  day’.   52.94% respondents’ use mobile device for more than 3  hours,  14.38%  use  it  for  one  hour,  13.73%  for  2  hours,  11.11%  for  less  than  an  hour  and  7.84%  for  3  hours.  
92.81%  use  mobile  devices  for  daily  information  needs  and  entertainment,  69.93%  use  it  for  Academic  Information  and  30.07%  use  the  mobile  devices  for  research work. Balakrishnan & Raj30  has also supported  the  finding  as  they  mentioned  that  ‘mobile  phones  are  known to be very popular among the university students,  increasing  their  social  inclusion  and  connectedness  as  well as providing a sense of security as they can contact  others  in  times  of  distress  or  emergency’.  
The  use  of  mobile  devices  for  various  purposes  depends on the availability of the Internet on the mobile  device. All students have Internet facility on their mobile  devices.There  are  different  ways  to  access  the  Internet  through  the  mobile  device.  It  varies  from  university

Figure  2  shows  that  93.46%  are  using  email,  SMS,  Whatsapp or other chat apps for academic information, 83%  discuss with classmates for course materials, assignment  etc,  while  77.78%  transport  files,  60.79%  use  them  for  posting  or  commenting  study  related  items  to  social  networking sites and 22.88% for posting on bookmarking  sites. Only 16.34% use mobile devices for scanning QR  codes and 15.69% are using them for MOOCs. Kumar31,  et  al.  has  stressed  that,  ‘mobile  devices  are  a  perfect  vehicle  for  making  educational  opportunities.’ 6.6.  f or  browsing,  reading,  viewing,  Listening  for  
Learning  and  Study 
Mobile devices have been used for browsing various  information  sources  for  learning  and  study.  Figure  3  reveals that most of the LIS students and research scholars  use  mobile  devices  for  browsing  or  reading  posts  on  social  networking  sites  (e.g.  Facebook,  Whatsapp)  with  79.74%,  and  79.08%  use  them  for  browsing  through  Websites,  blogs,  wikis,  micro-blogs,  etc.,  while  66.01%  for  viewing  video  clips  (from  youTube,  TED  talks  or  similar),  and  63.39%  for  reading  e-books,  with  55.56%  for reading articles from open access professional journals  and  magazines. Very  few  LIS  students  and  scholars  use  mobile devices for listening to podcasts with 30.07% and  23.53% access other learning stuff (for learning foreign  languages, XML, etc.). Farley7, et. al. reported that ‘the  use  of  social  media,  particularly  Facebook,  on  mobile  technologies for learning purposes, is a theme that emerged  spontaneously during the initial focus group discussions.  The  majority  of  students  reported  that  they  belonged  to  one  or  more  course-related  facebook  groups  set  up  by  fellow students and used these groups actively. Students  viewed  Facebook,  not  only  as  a  social  tool  for  staying  connected  with  friends  and  family,  but  as  an  essential  tool  for  communicating  and  collaborating  with  peers  in  their courses.’ Lampe, et. al.,32  also comes up with similar  conclusions.  Furthermore,  Madhusudhan5   also  reported  that ‘research scholars are most frequently using mobile  apps  for  checking  social  networking  sites  (79.34%)’.

6.7. Use  of  Productivity tools  for  Learning  and  
Study 
Students  use  productivity  tools  on  mobile  devices  for learning and study. These include creating documents,  
planning or checking a personal schedule, making notes  with  note  taking  tools  or  memo  tools  (Fig.  4).  
71.89%  use  mobile  device  for  creating  documents,  52.28% use it for planning or checking a personal schedule  and only 37.25% use it for making notes with note taking  tools  or  memo  tools.  On  the  contrary,  Dukic,  Chiu,  &  Lo14   reported  that  ‘more  than  half  of  LIS  students  use  smartphones  for  planning  their  personal  schedules  and  organising  daily  and  weekly  activities,  and  a  little  less  than  half  use  note-taking  tools  and  only  21%  create  documents  with  their  smartphones.’

6.8. for  Making  a recording  for  Learning  and  
Study 
Mobile devices have the feature of recording. Through  this  feature  one  can  take  photos  to  record  learning  material, formal interview or recording a seminar or other  presentation by a speaker, creating videos and audios for  study  purposes  (e.g.,  presentations,  assignments). 
Figure  5  depicts  that  81.69%  take  photos  to  record  learning materials (e.g., book pages, slides), 50.98% use  mobile  device  to  record  a  seminar  or  other  presentation  by  a  speaker,  and  50.33%  use  it  for  creating  videos  for  study  purposes,  and  very  few  use  it  for  recording  voice (37.25%) and only 31.37% for recording a formal  interview  (as  a  part  of  research).  Dukic,  Chiu,  &  Lo14  found  that  ‘smartphone  functionality  of  taking  photos  is  often  performed  by  45%  of  respondents,  while  audio  recording  is  performed  only  by  28%  of  respondents.  Video  recording  with  smartphone  is  very  rarely  used  for  learning  and  study  purposes’.

services. These applications assist everyone in using mobile  devices  more  efficiently  and  effectively  (Fig.  6). 
figure 6. Most frequently used apps. 
Presently  top  5,  most  frequently  used  apps  by  LIS  students and research scholars are: Gmail app, whatsapp,  google  app,  adobe  reader,  and  PDF  viewer  that  assist  them  in  both  daily  lives  and  for  study  and  learning.  Bicen  &  Kocakoyun21   reported  that  ‘41.7%  of  students  use  applications  for  communication  purposes,  26.4%  because  of  being  popular,  20.8%  because  of  curiosity.  Interestingly,  22.2%  respondents  used  for  educational  purposes’.  Farley7,  et  al.   found  that  ‘over  half  of  the  students surveyed at the University of Southern Queensland  used apps for learning purposes. International students and  students  studying  foreign  languages  other  than  English  frequently  use  dictionary  or  language  apps  on  their  mobile  devices,  during  class  and  informal  study  times  to assist them with translating or understanding English  vocabulary.’ Madhusudhan5  reported that ‘research scholars  are  using  mobile  apps  for  checking  social  networking  sites (79.34%), e-mail and chatting (73.91%), information  searching (70.10%), and cloud-based office applications  (36.95%), On contrary, he mentioned that mobile devices  are  less  used  for  finding  books  using  web  apps  (25%),  references  (23.91%),  online  citation  tools  (11.04%),  and  productivity  (such  as  Ever-note,  Dropbox,  Pages,  Keynote,  and  Notes)  (5.97%)’. 
5.10. Use  of  Mobile  Devices  for  Library  Services 
In the present era, mobile devices are used for providing  library services. Therefore, it has become a challenge for  academic libraries to keep pace with dynamic growth of  mobile  technology  and  provide  services  for  the  mobile  users.  Bomhold33   surveyed  53  academic  library  mobile  apps and mobile web sites and determined the variety of  discovery  functions  available.  Bhue  &  Bhoi34discussed  certain services libraries can offer through mobile devices,  including information alert service, mobile apps, mobile  websites, Ask to Librarian, Service virtual/audio tour to  library  e-resources  with  mobile  interface,  QR  codes  on  mobiles  to  integration  of  mobile  number  with  library  automation  software  (Fig.  7).  
Maximum respondents used mobile devices to access  the  Library  website  with  83.66%,  45.75%  check  library  hours, library map, 41.83% access institutional repository,  and 39.87% to contact a librarian. Very few respondents  use mobile devices to access the Web OPAC constituting

16.34%, accessing e-journals 12.42% and e-books 1.96%.  ‘Many studies on mobile learning also report that a very  low percentage of students search library resources with  smartphones’3,22. 
6.11.benefits  of  using  Mobile  Devices 
Students use mobile technology to meet their information  needs. These portable devices have an impact on teaching,  learning,  and  on  the  connections  between  formal  and  informal  learning,  work  and  leisure.  It  is  evident  that  use of mobile technology among students in Universities  across different countries has increased. These benefits run  from  being  these  devices  easy  to  use  or  providing  easy  and  anytime  access  to  learning  resources,  or  portability  to  easy  communication  (Fig.  8).  
Figure 8. Benefts of using mobile devices. 
The majority 94.11% respondents feel that the major  benefit to use mobile devices in their everyday, followed by  easy access to learning resources (85.62%) and anytime access  (83%). Other benefits range from 57-68% includes, tool for  recall (67.32%), portability (66.01%), multiple functionalities  (65.35%), saves time (58.82%) and foster collaboration and  easy communication (57.52%). Similar findings in varying  degrees are reported by: Mi23, et al., Brown & Metcalf25,  Dashtestani4, Wanger26, Chen & Denoyelles24, Alzaza  &  yaakub37,  Kukulska-Hulme38, et  al. 
6.12.Common barriers  in  the  free  use  of  Mobile  
Devices 
There are many barriers associated with using mobile  devices like any other technology. These risks vary from  poor network coverage to high charging plans, slow load  time  to  small  screen  size  (Fig.  9).  

========6========

SHARMA & MADHUSUDHAN: USE OF MOBILE DEVICES By  LI S  STUDENTS IN CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES OF U.P. 
Figure 9 illustrates that most of the students feel poor  network coverage to be the biggest barrier in using a mobile  device  with  66.01%  and  high  charging  data  plans  to  be  second in place with 64.71%. These findings are supported  by Fasae & Idowu39, who found that ‘the students using  mobile devices for academic practices have poor Internet  connectivity (81.25%) and high cost of data subscription  (53.75%)’.  Madhusudhan5 ‘poor  network  coverage  is  perhaps the biggest barrier that interrupts the enjoyment  of  using  3G  services  with  (53.26%),  and  high  charging  data  plans  (50%)’.  
figure 9. risks and problems associated using mobile devices. 
50.98% feel slow load time, 48.36% small screen size,  46.41% lack of high speed and 45.47% data security are  problems associated with using mobile devices. Since less  people are aware of e-resources and responsive websites,  so it has corresponded to a lower percentage show with  only  37.25%  feeling  authenticity  of  e-resources  as  a  barrier while, 35.95% feel distractions from phone, lack  of responsive sites with 33.33%, difficulty in typing text  with  32.68%,  lack  of  specialised  content  formats  with  28.10%,  difficult  device  management  with  23.53%  and  difficulty in reading content format with 21.57%. Similar  problems, in varying degrees,  have been  pointed out  by  other  researchers:  Madhusudhan5,  Dukic,  Chiu  &  Lo14,  Farley7, et al., Handal, MacNish & Petocz40, Mtega41, et al.,  Fujimoto15, Alzaza & yaakub37, Kukulska-Hulme38, et al. and  Parsons42. 
7. SUggeStIonS   for  effeCtIve USe  of  
MobILe  DevICeS 
7.1. Suggestions  for  the  Universities  and  LIS  
Departments 
(a) University authorities should lay down certain policy  
towards  the  use  of  mobile  devices  and  to  develop  
new tools/mobile apps for delivering library services  
through  mobile  devices 
(b) LIS Departments should stress for provision of Wi- 
Fi  facility  to  all  the  students  round  the  clock (c) LIS  Departments  may  incorporate  topics  related  to  
mobile Apps in the existing syllabus at MLIS, course.  
It  is  necessary  to  create  awareness  and  educate  the  
students on all library resources/e-journals available  
over  the  Smartphone  to  enhance  its  usage 
(d) Subject teachers should encourage students in class  
to use mobile devices for academic information like  
searching  meaning  to  different  words 
(e) Research  supervisors  should  also  encourage  their  
scholars  to  make  use  of  mobile  devices  in  their  
work. 
7.2. Suggestions  for  University  Libraries 
(a) Libraries  should  provide  Wi-Fi  facility  to  library  
users 
(b) Libraries  should  design  library  apps  for  android  
and  windows  based  smart  phones  and  other  mobile  
devices 
(c) Libraries  should  develop  mobile  library  websites/  
redesign  existing  website  into  responsive  website  
that would be more responsive, dynamic, interactive  
and  compatible  with  mobile  devices 
(d) Library  should  take  a  step  forward  to  connect  their  
OPAC  to  mobile  devices  and  create  MOPAC (e) Libraries  should  start  services  like  sending  instant  
messages  regarding  new  arrivals  to  the  users’  on  
mobile  devices 
(f) Libraries  should  adapt  to  delivering  services  by  
mobile devices, so that users find it easy to contact  
the  librarian  and  other  library  staff  for  their  query (g) Libraries should send regular flash message broadcasting  
for  latest  notification,  CAS,  etc  so  that  users  can  
get  quick  information 
(h)  University  librarian  may  develop  an  Information  
Literacy  Programme  on  effective  use  of  mobile  
devices  for  library  resources  and  services. 
7.3. Suggestions  for  Students  and research  
Scholars 
(a) LIS students and research scholars should use mobile  
applications  like  Gmail  app,  Whatsapp,  etc.,  for  
effective information communication and dissemination  
as  part  of  their  studies  and/or  research  work (b) LIS students and research scholars should use different  
productivity  tools  for  creating  documents  to  write  
quick  notes  to  click  photos  and  record  videos  for  
the  purpose  of  their  studies  and/or  research  work (c) LIS  students  and  research  scholars  should  search  
Google  or  other  search  engines  on  their  mobile  
devices  for  getting  their  relevant  information  than  
running  to  desktops 
(d) LIS  students  and  research  scholars  may  create  
and  join  groups  on  mobile  apps  like  Whatsapp  or  
Facebook  particular  to  their  field  and  invite  their  
colleagues  and  peers  to  join  these  groups,  so  that  
more  people  related  to  same  field  may  interact,  
comment  and  share  information  that  in  turn  may  
facilitate  students  in  their  studies  and  research  
scholars  in  their  research.

6.    ConCLUSIonS 
The results of this study demonstrate that LIS students  studying  in  Central  Universities  are  frequent  users  of  mobile devices and they extensively use mobile devices  for their daily information needs, entertainment, leisure,  and communication purposes. Students and scholars even  make  use  of  these  mobile  devices  to  take  photos  to  record learning materials. However, they seldom use the  devices for reading academic resources such as academic  journals  and  e-books.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  LIS  students  are  less  inclined  to  read  longer  and  more  complex  materials  with  their  mobile  devices.  It  may  be  because  of  small  screen  size  of  these  devices.  It  was  further  observed  that  many  students  are  using  the  mobile  devices  for  discussing  with  classmates  for  course material, assignment and study related issues. So,  it  enhances  the  opportunities  for  collaborative  learning.  When it comes to accessing library resources and services  through mobile devices, it is surprising that LIS students  under  use  these,  although  they  most  of  the  time  access  library  website  or  check  library  hours.  However,  they  very  seldom  access  subscribed  e-journals  and  e-books  from  their  mobile  device. 
Benefits  of  using  mobile  devices  as  mentioned  by  LIS  students  include  anytime  access  to  learning  resources,  saves  time  and  foster  collaboration  and  easy  communication.  On  the  other  hand,  major  barriers  are  poor  network  coverage,  high  charging  data  plans,  slow  load  time,  small  screen  size,  lack  of  high  speed  and  data  security.  In  particular  an  in-depth  study  should  be  conducted to understand the impact of the use of mobile  devices  by  students  followed  by  a  detailed  study  on  smartphone addiction to students and benefits as well. We  hope  that  the  present  study  has  succeeded  in  providing  a  starting  point  in  studying  mobile  devices  and  mobile  learning  adaption  investigation.
