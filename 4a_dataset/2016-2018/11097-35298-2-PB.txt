ABSTRACT 
The study presents an overview of the doctoral dissertations awarded in the subject discipline of Library and  Information Science in India during 2010 to 2014. Some of the key areas analysed include, year wise overview of  the doctoral degrees awarded and their growth on an annual basis. The study also focuses on the popularity of the  subject at the state level and in universities across the country.  From data analysis, it emerged that 177 doctoral  degrees were awarded in Library and Information Science in India during 2010-2014. Of the total doctoral theses  awarded in Social Sciences in India during the period of study, a meager 3.05 per cent were awarded in the Library  and Information Science. A total of 43 unique institutes and 17 states were identifed which awarded doctoral degrees  across India at an average of 4.11 and 10.41 degrees each, respectively. Gujarat emerged the most popular state by  awarding the maximum 16.38 per cent doctoral degrees and at the institutional level, Baba Bhim Rao Ambedkar  University, Marathwada emerged the leading institute with 9.60 per cent of the total doctoral degrees. There is a  steady decline in the award of doctoral degrees in India, besides the institutions also do not show any consistency  
in undertaking doctoral research in LIS in India.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
In  India  a  considerable  difference  is  observed  in  the  popularity  each  subject  discipline  enjoys  among  students.  If  on one hand, some subject areas receive an immense response  among the student community, on the other hand, there are some  subject  disciplines,  which  do  not  enjoy  so  much  popularity  among students, with the result a lesser percentage of students  pursue a Master’s or Doctoral degree in such areas. Individual  growth and development of a subject discipline has a direct  bearing upon the visibility and popularity of the subject among  students and so do research in general and Doctoral research  in particular plays a very signifcant role in the overall growth  and development of a subject discipline.  
India has a very wide and huge education system, be it at  the school level, college level or even at the university level. As  per the MHRD data 2010-11, there are 13,96331 schools across  India, in which more than 248,568,502 students stand enrolled  from class I to XII1.  Over 35,500 affliated colleges with an  enrollment capacity of over 20 million students2  are imparting  education at under graduate and post graduate level. Still more,  759 universities3  are functional across India, offering courses  at  Master’s  degree  level  education  and  extending  doctoral  research opportunities to students in their areas of interest.  
Library  and  information  science  as  a  subject  feld  is  widely pursued at the global level and so holds true about the

subject feld in India. The importance of libraries as assessed  by  Downs4,5,  by  studying  120  Universities  in  America  and  found that two third of doctoral dissertations awarded in the  US  from  1957  through  1966  were  from  those  38  per  cent  institutes which had resourceful libraries. But still, the state of  library and information science subject discipline by no means  can  be  considered  in  the  best  state  of  health  and  the  lesser  doctoral research undertaken in the LIS is being seen as one of  the reasons, which has limped the growth and development of  the subject discipline. The undergoing discussion is about the  doctoral degrees awarded in the feld of library and information  science  in  India  during  the  period  2010-2014.  The  study  is  based on the data compiled from the annual bibliographies of  doctoral dissertations in the social sciences, published by the  Association of Indian Universities (AIU), New Delhi.  
1.1 Library  and  Information  Science Education  in  
India 
The  library  and  information  science  (LIS)  education  in  India  traces  its  formal  roots  in  Baroda  School,  which  was  established in 19116 and W.A Borden was invited to develop  the library system of the state and to pass on some basic nitty- gritty to the library workers. Thereafter, there was no looking  back in the LIS education, be it opening of LIS education in  Punjab  University  of  undivided  Indian  in  Lahore  in  19157,  establishment of Library school in Madras University in 1929  by  Ranganathan8,  the  father  of  library  science  in  India  with

the help of Madras Library Association. This was followed by  starting  of  the  Diploma  course  in Andhra  University  by  Dr.  M.O Thomas in 19359  and the rest is history.  
At  University  level  LIS  education  received  boost  post  independent India. Calcutta University upgraded its diploma  course in the Bachelors degree in 196910. This was followed by  starting Bachelors programme at University of Delhi, in 194911 by the father of library Science in India and was followed by  the MLIS programme in the same year. University of Delhi  started doctoral programme in LIS frst time the in India and  so where introduced doctoral programmes in other universities  across  India.  As  on  date,  131  institutes  across  the  country  offer Bachelor’s degree, 136 offer Master’s degree, 20 MPhill  programmes, and 93 Universities offer doctoral programmes in  library and information science in India12.  
2.  OBJECTIVES  
• To present an overview of the doctoral research trend in  
the feld of library and information science in India. • To  work  out  the  growth  and  distribution  of  doctoral  
degrees  awarded  in  library  and  information  science  in  
India during the last fve years viz. for the period 2010- 
2014. 
• To  refect  the  leading  institutes  and  the  states  involved  
with the doctoral research activities in LIS by analysing  
the  doctoral  degrees  awarded  in  LIS  across  different  
institutes and states in India during the period of study.  • To  assess  the  overall  popularity  of  the  LIS  research  in  
India. 
3.  SCOPE AND  METHODOLOGY 
The study is purely confned to library and information  science  subject  feld  within  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of  India, undertaken with the view to assess the trend of doctoral  research  undertaken  in  the  feld  of  library  and  information  science Education in India. In all, 43 unique institutions were  identifed which have awarded the doctoral theses during the  period of study (See Appendix-I). The fndings of the study can  be easily generalised and can be undertaken at other levels also.  The study can add to the overall scenario of doctoral research  at the global level. The present study simply refects a research  trend in library and information science across India based on  the compiled data. 
To undertake the present study, data were compiled from  the Bibliography of Doctoral Dissertation in India, published  by  the Association  of  Indian  Universities  on  annualy13.  The  data were carefully sort and was structured as per the objectives  of  the  study.  For  easy  compilation  and  to  perform  other  mathematical computations, keeping in view the objectives of  the study, data was put to MS-Excel. 
4.  LITERATURE  REVIEw 
Library and information science in India is over 105 years  old and since then, much has been done towards the growth and  development of the subject feld at academics and at research  level. So have researchers from time to time evaluated both  the  sides  of  science.  Some  of  the  studies  carried  out  earlier  by researchers to understand the research scenario of LIS in  
380 
India.   
Thavamani and Pushparaj14  undertook a study to assess  the  doctoral  degrees  awarded  in  the  feld  of  library  and  information  science  in  North-Eastern  region  of  India  since  2007-2011. The researchers observed that Information sources  and services were the thrust area of research in the region and  more than 38 per cent doctoral degrees from the region were  awarded from Meghalaya alone. The doctoral research in the  Library and information science in India traces its roots around  1950’s during, which two doctoral degrees were awarded in  Library and information science15. Satija in his study gave a  detailed description of the doctoral degrees awarded in LIS up  to 1999. A steady growth was observed in the doctoral research  output in LIS from 1980’s to 1995 (Sivalingaiah16, et al.) The  researchers found that 807 doctoral degrees were awarded in  LIS from 1980 to 2007, at an average of 29.88 doctoral degrees  each year. The study can also be considered as comprehensive,  as the data was collected from three different national databases  like Infibnet, Vidyanidi, University News and other web based  surveys.  
A total of 171 doctoral dissertations awarded in the feld  of  library  and  information  sciences  from  the  period  2003- 2008  at  an  average  of  28.50  degrees  each year  observed  by  Madasamy and Alwaammal17  by analysing University News.  Similarly, Mahapatra & Sahoo18  studied 164 doctoral degrees,  awarded from 1997 to 2003 at an average of 23.42 doctoral  dissertations  each  year.  The  authors  in  their  study  pointed  out  over  33  different  topics  over  which  the  research  studies  were  conducted  and  identifed  47  different  institutes,  which  had awarded these degrees. Singh & Babbar12  in their study  observed  that  1754  doctoral  degrees  were  awarded  in  India  from  1950  to  2012  at  an  average  of  27.84  doctoral  degrees  each year. The researchers found 22 states involved with the  LIS education awarded by as many as 81 different institutes.  
Maity  and  Hatua19   analysed  1058  doctoral  dissertations  awarded in LIS in India for the period 1950 to 2012 at an average  of 16.79 degrees each year. The researchers analysed the data  on 10 year time interval and observed a steady growth in the  doctoral  degrees  awarded. The  researchers  have  also  shown  concern  towards  the  growing  intrusion  of  the  Information  Technology in the LIS profession, which the researchers view  as a threat.  
There  are  some  various  other  quantitative  studies  conducted in the feld of Library and information sciences across  India, measuring doctoral research output were conducted 20–24.  Lahiri25  analysed research areas, research growth and growth  patterns, of doctoral thesis in LIS for the period 1957-1995.  Patra and Chand26,27  analysed LISA for the period 1967-2004  and found research growth in LIS in India low, but at the same  time found India as one of the leading research country among  SAARC and ASEAN countries.  
A good number of studies quantifying the doctoral research  output in library and information sciences have been conducted  in other countries as well. Zong28, et al.,  quantifed the doctoral  research output in Library and information science in China for  the period 1994-2011. The researcher found Wuhan University  as one of the premier research institutions conducting doctoral  research in LIS in China. The authors also pointed out various

research topics, which constituted the bulk of doctoral research  output  in  China.  Doctoral  dissertations  written  by  African- American women between 1993 through 2003 were examined  by Franklin and Jaeger29. 
While  analysing  the  3121  doctoral  dissertations  in  Library and information science awarded from 1930 to 2009,  Sugimoto30,  et al . found library history, citation analysis, and  information seeking behaviour as the core research area in LIS  doctoral  research.  Samdani  and  Bhatti31   studied  the  doctoral  dissertations awarded in LIS in Pakistan for the period 1964  to 2010. The researcher found that 28 doctoral degrees were  awarded during 46 year period at an average of 0.60 doctoral  degrees  each  year.  The  researchers  also  found  that  majority  67.85  per  cent  doctoral  degrees  were  awarded  by  foreign  university and 32.14 per cent were awarded by the Pakistani  universities.  
5.  RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  
The data retrieved has been tabulated into three different  tables,  as  per  the  objectives  of  the  study. The  percentage  at  most of the places has been drawn up to two decimal places  and has not been rounded off.  
As  shown  in  Table  1,  total  177  doctoral  degrees  were  awarded  in  the  feld  of  library  and  information  science  in  India during 2010-2014, constituting around 3 per cent of the  total doctoral degrees awarded in the feld of Social Sciences  across the country during the same period. 50 (28.24 per cent)  doctoral degrees were awarded in 2011, followed by 26.55 per  cent in 2010. In all 177 degrees were awarded by 43 unique  institutes at an average of 4.11 degrees at an average of 0.84  degrees  each  year.  Except  in  the  year  2011,  which  recorded  the award of highest 50 doctoral degrees, while as the rest of  the period recorded a considerable decline. On average 35.40  doctoral degrees were awarded in LIS in each year during the  period of study. A very small percentage of universities 5.53  per cent have awarded the doctoral degrees in LIS of the 759

UGC notifed universities. These fgures invite our attention to  the fact that a very institutes offer doctoral degrees in LIS and  a very small percentage of students pursue doctoral research  in LIS after completing their masters degrees. The fgures are  abysmal when compared to degrees awarded in other subject  areas by institutes across the country. The steady decline in the  number  of  doctoral  degrees  awarded  in  LIS  signals  towards  the  immediate  need  to  look  into  the  reasons  for  the  waning  popularity  of  the  subject  at  the  doctoral  level  among  LIS  Students and so is there need, to encourage students at Masters  Degree level to pursue doctoral research.  
It may not be perhaps inappropriate to say that library and  information science as a subject feld does not enjoy popularity  at par with other social science subjects in India. As shown in  Table 2, doctoral degrees were awarded in the subject across  17 (47.22 per cent) states of the country, which is less than the  50 per cent territorial area of the country. On average 10.40  doctoral degrees were awarded by each individual state during  the period of study at an average of 2.08 degrees each year.  Gujarat is the leading state, which has awarded the maximum  29 (16.38 per cent) doctoral degrees during the period, at an  average of 5.80 degrees each year, which is highest among all  the states of India. Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka,

Andhra  Pradesh,  West  Bengal  and  Orissa  are  some  of  the  leading states of the country, which have awarded more than  10  doctoral  degrees  during  the  period  of  study. Also,  these  states  have  maintained  a  consistency  in  awarding  doctoral  degree each year of the study, which is missing in the case of  other states. Punjab has awarded the lowest 2 (1.12 per cent)  degrees, hence stands at the bottom of the table.  
As shown in Table 3, at the institutional level, Dr. Baba  Sahib  Ambedkar  University,  Maharashtra  is  the  leading  institution which has awarded the maximum 17 (9.60 per cent)  doctoral degrees in LIS at an average of 3.40 degrees each year.  Hemchandera North Gujarat University, Karnataka University  and the B.R Ambedkar Open University are the other leading  
awarded  under  the  supervision  of  two  or  more  supervisors,  while as, the remaining 170 dissertations were awarded under  single supervisor. A total of 100 supervisors, were identifed,  who  guided  177  research  scholars  through  their  doctoral  study at an average of 1.77 doctoral scholars each supervisor,  and  these  include  seven  co-supervisors  as  well.  Of  the  total  research supervisors identifed, 59 supervisors each supervised  01  research  scholar,  21  supervisors  each  supervised  two  research scholars, 04 supervisors each guided 03 scholars, 07  supervisors each guided 04 research scholars, 03 supervisors  each supervised fve scholars, 01 research supervisor guided  6  scholars,  02  supervisors  each  guided  07  scholars  and  one  supervisor  has  guided  10  scholars.

universities  which  have  awarded  more  than  10  doctoral  degrees.  Dr,  Baba  Sahib Ambedkar  University,  Maharashtra  and the Karnataka University are the only universities which  have consistently awarded doctoral degrees during each year of  the study. Of the 759 Universities functional across India only  44 (5.79 per cent) universities are actively engaged with the  doctoral research in Library and information science. Nearly  30  per  cent  doctoral  degrees  were  awarded  by  the  leading  four universities and the remaining 70 per cent degrees were  awarded by 38 other universities. Even so, the twenty leading  universities of LIS research in India have conducted 77.41 per  cent doctoral research and the remaining 22 universities have  conducted 22.59 per cent of the remaining doctoral work.

dissertations awarded in the library and information science,  32.20 per cent were supervised by the leading ten supervisors  and the remaining 68.80 per cent dissertations were supervised  by remaining 90 supervisors, as shown in Table 4.  
Prof. M.K Prajapati of Hemchandracharya North Gujarat  University,  emerged  the  leading  supervisor,  10  doctoral  degrees were awarded under his supervision during the period  of study. Seven doctoral degrees each were awarded under the  supervision of Prof A.A. Vaishnav and Prof. Shivdanbhai M.  Charan from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada Univeristy,  Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University. Six doctoral degrees  were awarded under the supervision of Prof. S.M. Shaf from  Kashmir University.  
Although, all the 177 doctoral degrees were awarded in  an individual area of study, but in order to look at the overall  research trend in LIS, most of the doctoral work was undertaken  in the area of application of information technology in libraries.  The research areas undertaken have been categorized into eight  main areas, which stands further divided into 85 sub areas, as  shown in Table 5. Although research in LIS is broadly pursued  in  information  technology,  but  that  does  not  undermine  or  exclude  other  related  areas  of  study.  From  the  different  research areas highlighted, the research in LIS appears fairly  balanced,  need  based  and  representative.  However,  it  would  more  ideal  to  widen  the  scope  of  the  study  by  undertaking  research on an interdisciplinary basis, with more emphasis on  the contemporary subject areas.   
6.  DISCUSSION AND  CONCLUSION 
Library and information science as a subject feld enjoys  a fair amount of popularity among Indian students, but at the  same time it may not be inappropriate to say LIS education  is not generally the frst choice among Indian students, when  compared to other conventional social science subject areas.  
Table 5. Main subject areas of doctoral study 
Main subject area Information technology 
This gets better assessed by the fact that of the total doctoral  degrees  awarded  in  the  feld  of  social  sciences  viz.  5788  only 177 (3.05 per cent) were awarded in the feld of Library  and  information  sciences.  Besides,  of  the  759  functional  universities across India, the doctoral research is being offered  by 43 (5.66 per cent) universities only. While as, the Bachelor’s  and Master’s degree courses in library and information science  are  run  across  120  odd  institutions,  which  still  cannot  be  considered as good enough, given the number of college and  universities offering other Bachelors’ and Masters degree level  courses across the country.  
Growth  and  development  of  a  subject  feld  are  directly  associated  with  the  amount  of  research  undertaken  in  that  particular subject area and if the subject fnds very few scholars  or no scholars at all, the subject is bound to die down. The  Research state of library and information science in India by  and large is good, but there is considerable need to improve  both  the  academic  and  research  state  of  the  subject  feld  across the country. During the period 2010 to 2014 a total of  16000 research articles, were published in the feld of social  sciences from India in SCImago indexed journals out of which  only 1124 (7.02 per cent) were from library and information  science.  Similarly,  during  the  same  period  at  global  level,  a  total of 48861 research articles, were published in library and  information  science  across  the  globe  in  SCImago  indexed  journals, out of which 1124 (2.30 per cent) articles were from  India32. So library and information science as a subject feld  has to improve its research state both at the domestic as well as  international level.  
Given the geographical distribution, library and information  science as a subject is not concentrated in a particular region or  belt of the country. The seventeen states and union territories  which have been awarded a doctoral degree in LIS represent  all most all the regions of the country. However, at the state

level, the subject appears to be quite popular in Gujarat than  in other states of the country. For obvious reasons, the states  having good number of universities are the ones which lead in  awarding the doctoral degrees, but there are institutions, which  at institutional level have awarded more doctoral degrees than  a group of states clubbed together.  
To rejuvenate the library and information science at both  academic and research front, a national level committee should  be  constituted  to  look  into  the  reasons,  whereby  the  subject  feld has not attained so much of popularity among the Indian  students. Need is to widen the scope of the subject, new job  markets  are  to  be  opened,  as  the  subject  should  not  remain  confned to the four walls of the library. States and universities  which do not offer Library and information sciences education  should  be  brought  under  the  ambit  by  opening  up  new  schools of Library and information science. There is a need to  continuously upgrade the syllabi of the library and information  science Schools, which should be more market and job oriented.  Out of date and irrelevant library practices should be done away  with. Information Technology has become the new face of the  Library Science and so should library professionals embrace it  from the very beginning of their professional education.  
The  data  compiled  from  the  bibliography  of  Doctoral  dissertations awarded in Social in India during the period of  study, by no means can be considered as an exhaustive. The  bibliography is simply compiled on the basis of information  passed  on  to  AIU  by  the  different  autonomous  institutions,  including Universities. A good number of universities do not  report their doctoral research output to the AIU. A simple case  of this can be defended by the fact that out of 759 functional  universities across the country, only 171 institutes/universities  have reported their doctoral research output to the AIU during  the  period  of  study.  Here  it  can  be  argued  that  either  these  universities  do  not  offer  doctoral  research  programmes  in  Social Sciences, or these institutions did not award any doctoral  degree in social sciences during the period of study, and the  third reason can be simply these institutions did not report their  doctoral research output to the AIU.  
Compiling  national  level  bibliographies’  of  doctoral  research  output  is  equally  important  and  to  this  effect  UGC  should  make  it  binding  upon  all  research  institutions  across  the  country  to  report  their  doctoral  research  output  to  the  agencies like AIU and INFLIBNET. INFLIBNET has already  created a national level ETD repository Shodhganga, but again  the  database  is  not  comprehensive  like  AIU  bibliography.  A  comprehensive  national  level  bibliography  of  doctoral  research output in all subjects can help in giving insights about  the  strengths  and  weakness  of  different  subject  areas  at  the  research level.  
Library and information science research should be more  focused and need based, whereby real life professional problems  encountered should be overcome. There is a far greater need to  integrate  the  teaching  and  practice  aspect  of  the  library  and  information  science.  A  practicing  library  professional  can  provide  better  and  thoughtful  insights  towards  the  teaching  and  research  of  Library  and  information  science. The  world  in general and Indian in particular, it is being observed that  teachers and practitioners of Library Science are not moving

hand in hand and both the category of LIS professionals extend  step motherly treatment towards each other, which should be  done away with.  
The study leaves enough scope to look into the reasons as  why some library schools are more active on the research front,  while as other lag considerably. Indeed shortage infrastructure,  supervisory  staff,  research  grants,  etc.,  may  turn  out  to  be  the most compelling reasons, but that should not come as an  excuse for the malfunction of such library schools. Nearly 32  per cent universities across India are private, which are doing  exceptionally well in all the subject areas and there should be  no reason why library and information science teaching and  practice should not be encouraged in such institutions.
