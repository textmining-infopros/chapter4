Spam e-mail and calls from the predatory publishers are very similar in purpose: they are deceptive and  produce material losses. Moreover, the predatory publishers show evolving strategies to lure potential victims, as  their number increases. In an efort to help researchers defending against their constant menace, this article aims to  identify a set of common features of spam e-mail and calls from predatory publishers. The methodology consisted  of a comparative analysis of data found on the Internet and e-mails received at several addresses during December  2017 – January 2018. The results indicate that concealed, fake or disguised identity of the sender and/or of the  message, mass mailing, missing or useless opt-out option and an obvious commercial character are the most prominent  common features. Moreover, the location of predatory publishers is well disguised; the analysis of the real location,  found using web-based tools, suggests a joint management or at least a concerted action of several publishers, and  raises additional questions related to the reasons of masking the true location. From a theoretical standpoint, the  results show, once again, that predatory publishers are a part of the worldwide scam, and should be ‘convicted’ in  a similar way, including the means of legal actions. From a practical perspective, distinct recommendations were  phrased for researchers, policy makers, libraries, and future research.

1. IntRoduCtIon 
There are many terms which seem to be understood by  everyone, but their meanings are diferent and controversial.  Common sense can be used to know that an e-mail is ‘spam’  and  a  call  for  papers  comes  from  a  ‘predatory  journal’,  although the literature reveals an ongoing controversy on the  defnition. Spam is part of the daily life of everyone with an  e-mail  address  and  calls  for  papers  have  the  same  efect  on  people from academia and research1. 
The creation of the term ‘predatory journal’ is attributed the  American  Colorado-based  academic  librarian  and  researcher  Jefrey Beall in 20082. The original defnition, involving the  fact  that  authors  are  charged  by  publication,  but  deceived  in  the  end,  is  controversial3,  as  well  as  their  list,  which  has  been removed from the author’s website4. The list was based  on several criteria, derived by Beall from those developed by  the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)5, which can be  used to identify predatory journals; some of them, used in the  research presented in the article, include: 
• No single individual is identifed as any specifc journal’s  
editor; 
• Begins operations with a large feet of journals; • The name of a journal does not adequately refect its  
origin; 
• Use boastful language claiming to be a “leading publisher”  
even though the publisher may only be a startup or a

novice organisation; 
• Operate in a Western country; 
• Have a “contact us” page that only includes a web form or  
an email address, and the publisher hides or does not reveal 
its location; 
• The  publisher  lists  insufcient  contact  information,  
including contact information that does not clearly state  
the headquarters location or misrepresents the headquarters  
location; 
• The publisher engages in excessive use of spam email to  
solicit manuscripts; 
• The  publishers’  ofcers  use  email  addresses  that  end  in  
gmail.com, yahoo.com, or some other free email supplier; • For the name of the publisher, the publisher uses names  
such  as  “Network”,  “Center”,  “Association”,  “Institute”  
etc. when it is only a solitary, proprietary operation and does  
not meet the defnition of the term used or implied non- 
proft mission; 
• The publisher displays prominent statements that promise  
rapid publication and/or unusually quick peer review; • The  publisher  appears  to  focus  exclusively  on  article  
processing fee procurement; 
• The publisher copies or egregiously mimics journal titles  
from other publishers. 
The importance of predatory journals is justifed by their  efects. From an ethical perspective, a recent study6  shows that  in  countries  where  academic  promotion  is  based  on  metrics  without  assessing  the  quality  of  articles,  predatory  journals

provided a “fast track” for the advancement of unscrupulous  researchers. At the same time, the economic crisis forces more  and more legitimate journals to assess fees in order to support  their  operation,  turning  them  into  predatory  ones6.  At  the  same time, researchers who publish in the predatory journals  (being  deceived  or)  use  the  scarcer  research  funds,  which  end by supporting the proliferation of predatory publishers7.  Despite the fact that after the public exposure of their lack of  quality control in the peer review process8,9  and selection of  the editorial board10 researchers can no longer be trapped and  some of them reinvented as proofng services11, the number of  predatory publishers is still growing12  and their strategies are  evolving13. 
Spam is a form of e-mail distinguished by anonymity, mass  mailing, and its unsolicited character14. Although the defnition  is generally agreed upon, the characteristics vary across diferent  sources based on the particular interest beyond. IT specialists  fghting  against  spam  are  interested  in  blocking  spam  emails  from reaching the inboxes of people, and focus their attention  on  characteristics  like  the  connection  behaviour,  servers  used  to send them, envelope sender address, header, use of HTML,  encoding,  signatures,  protocols,  camoufaged  contact  methods  (phishing),  including  masked  URLs,  or  characteristic  headers  that can reveal the mass mailing character15-19. 
Other types of documents are focusing on the end user, to  prevent them opening the spam e-mails, and produce guidelines  featuring  the  main  spam  characteristics14,20-23.  Nevertheless,  similar outputs are delivered by consultants to companies that  use mass e-mail attempting to reach the inboxes of their potential  customers:  how  to  avoid  having  their  campaign  message  classifed as spam24,25. Despite the intention, all these documents  reveal a series of features that help distinguishing spam e-mail:  anonymous  or  disguised  senders,  subjects  disguising  the  advertisement nature, missing or fake opt-out options, requests  for  sensitive  information,  scare  tactics,  asking  for  money  in  advance, lack of realism,  Perhaps the main characteristics are a  subject line that reveals the particular type of spam: fraud scheme,  bogus business opportunity, health and diet scam, pornography,  discount software ofers, Trojan horse e-mails, virus generated  e-mails21,23, and the presence of certain ‘fag’ words: urgent, free,  guarantee, spam, credit card etc.25. 
Both spam and predatory journals produce not only ethical  debates  or  loss  of  scientifc  information,  but  also  important  material  losses.  In  South  Africa,  The  Department  of  Higher  Education  and  Training  lost  during  the  last  decade  6.5-20  millions  euros  in  academic  subsidies  for  articles  published  in  predatory journals7. 
Several studies have pinpointed many similar features of  the calls for papers coming from multiple predatory publishers  and  conferences,  suggesting  a  concerted  action  beyond  the  simple copying of practices13, but also a similarity between them  and regular ‘spam’1,26-29. However, a systematic analysis has not  been carried out, since both ‘spam’ and ‘predatory journals’ do  not beneft upon a taxonomic set of criteria for recognition. As a  matter of fact, humans appear to be better than computers, which  acting in a taxonomic fashion, in recognising spam30. For this  reason, most recognition algorithms are built upon “supervised  learning”; this means that the receiver identifes a message as  
200 
“spam” and the computer includes future similar messages in  the same category. 
This article aims to identify a set of common features of  spam  e-mail  and  class  for  papers  from  predatory  publishers,  which can be used by researchers to avoid being deceived. 
2. MethodS 
Spam messages and calls for papers or review from predatory  journals and conferences were collected and compared based on  several  common  characteristics:  concealed,  fake  or  disguised  identity of the sender; concealed, fake or disguised identity of  the message; (hidden) mass mailing; the opt-out (unsubscribe)  option missing or not working; the commercial character. The  analysis relies on data found on the Internet and calls received at  several e-mail addresses between December 2017 and January  2018, with one exception, stated in the results section. While for  the spam messages the real sender could not be always verifed,  the calls for papers were sent by 68 journals, conferences and  proofreading  providers.  The  proofreading  service  providers  were included because they are former predatory publishers11, or  companies ofering both proofreading and publication services  (e.g., Savant Publishing House / Journals). Only few selected  calls are displayed. 
In  addition,  the  location  of  spammers  and  predatory  publishers was checked using the website https://www.site24x7. com/fnd-website-location.html. The analysis included all calls  received during January 5-11, 2018 to all addresses (two personal  and two job-related addresses), including calls from the same  journal received in diferent days and/or at diferent addresses. 
3.  ReSultS And dISCuSSIon 
The results are presented in Appendix A in the form of  paired comparisons showing on the left a similar typical spam  message and on the right the call for papers or review from  the  predatory  journal  showing  the  same  feature.  Multiple  characteristics  of  the  same  message  may  be  presented  and  discussed more than once, although the message is displayed  only  once  Most  messages  were  truncated  and  personal  identifers removed. 
3.1 Concealed,  Fake  or disguised  Identity  of  the  
Sender 
(a)  Inventing a fake sender, with a common or attractive name  
(Table A),  
(b)  Fake response/sender addresses (Tables A-B),  (c) Serial addresses (Table C),  
(d)  Use of multiple sender names in the same message (Table  
A-C);  
(e)  “Doctors”  used  to  make  the  message  more  trustworthy  
(Table D);  
(f)  The sender has a gender (Tables A, D).  
All these strategies have the same goal: giving the message  a  legitimate appearance, and  luring the receiver to  (at  least)  open and read the message. 
3.2 Concealed,  Fake  or disguised  Identity  of  the  
Message 
(a) use of “Re:” to give the appearance of the message  

========2========

PeTrISor : Are The PredATory PuBlISherS  u SINg SPAmmINg STrATegIeS For CAll For PAPerS ANd revIew requeSTS?  
being  sent  in  response,  with  a  common  or  attractive  name  (Table  E),  (b)  inducing  a  “need  to  act  immediately”  (Table  F), (d) use of boasting language, creating a fake image on the  importance of the contents of messages (Table E). Again, the  common goal of these strategies is to make the message seem  important, or at least trustworthy, and determine the receiver to  open and read it. 
3.3 (hidden)  Mass  Mailing 
(a) the lack of a “To:” address, or its replacement with a  generic one, such as “undisclosed recipients” (Tables A-B) or  a fake one (Table A), (b) impersonal addressing: “My dear”  (Table A), “dear Boss” (Table C), “dear Sir” (Table e), “dear  dr.”  (Table  g),  “dear  Colleague”,  or  no  addressing.  In  all  cases, such calls for papers or review are mass mails; the fact  that this feature is noticeable is a mistake of the senders, not  a strategy. However, it should make the receiver aware of not  being the only intended recipient. 
3.4 the opt-out  (unsubscribe) option  is  Missing  
or not Working  – All examples 
The  opt-out  option  is  added  nowadays  to  ensure  compliance with most laws, which require businesses to add  it in order for the message not to be treated as spam, resulting  into consequent penalties against the sender. However, most  laws require only its presence, while its behaviour cannot be  checked. Spammers and predatory publishers, if including the  option, make it useless. 
3.5 the  Commercial  Character  
Includes  focusing  on  discounts  (Table  D),  urge  to  act  immediately (Table F), or an apparent “connection” with the  virtual customer (Table g). By their original defnition calls  from  the  predatory  publishers  have  a  commercial  character,  since  their  ultimate  goal  is  to  charge  the  authors26,31,32.  In  this case, revealing the commercial character is a mistake of  senders,  which  should  be  noticed  immediately,  avoiding  the  trap. 
In summary, the frst three characteristics are present in  the defnition of ‘spam’ – anonymity and mass sending. The last  two are mistakes of senders, revealing the true nature of spam  and calls from predatory publishers: an unsolicited anonymous  mass mail, aimed only for the proft of the sender – in other  words, a mass mail. 
One  feature  which  can  also  be  noticed  in  both  type  of  messages  (traditional  spam  and  calls  from  predatory  publishers) is the poor English. This feature brings additional  evidence to the claims that the predatory publishers are located  in developing countries31,33. The results of the location analysis,  presented in Fig. 1, show several key features. First, a large  share of the predatory publishers masks the real location and  does not claim one (occasionally several worldwide locations  were claimed; these cases were labeled “worldwide”). Second,  several locations monopolise the publishers. The top real cities  were Burlington, mA, u.S.A. (11), Phoenix, Ar, u.S.A. (9)  and Scottsdale, AR, U.S.A. (9). The U.S.A. dominates the top  of “real” countries (almost 3/4). Claimed locations show more

diversity, without a clear domination of cities; the top claimed  countries are the U.S.A. and India (almost evenly), were more  than 50% of the publishers appear to be located. These results  are partially supporting in a fne tuned manner the hypothesis  on their location in developing countries, but raise additional  questions: 
• Why would a publisher claim a location in a developed  
ountry and have its website hosted in a diferent developed  
country (uK/uSA, Canada/uSA, and uK/germany)? • Why would a publisher reveal its origin in a developing  
country and have its website hosted in a diferent developed  
country (Nigeria/uSA, India/uSA, and India/France)? 
The  spatial  clustering  of  diferent  entities  (predatory  publishers,  proofng  service  providers)  in  several  cities  supports the previous claim that actually predatory publishers  are not rivals, but act together in a concerted way, and perhaps  the same entity lies behind a group of such publishers13. Other  fndings of the analysis are: 
• 71 e-mails were received from 54 publishers; in the e-mails  
106 servers were found; the large number of servers is due  
to the fact that in many cases the same message included  
more servers (see Table B) 
• The  most  insistent  solicitors  were  the  American  
International Journal of Contemporary Research (5 calls)  
and  the  Savant  Publishing  House  /  Savant  Journals  (4  
calls); 13 solicitors sent at least 2 calls 
• The  claimed  city  never  matched  the  real  one,  but  the  
claimed country matched the real one in 40/106 cases • Locations were found in 30 cities/8 countries and claimed  
in 27 cities/10 countries 
The time distribution of calls is presented in Fig. 2. The  image shows that the number of calls is lower on Saturdays and  Sundays, corresponding to the weekend in the Western Christian  countries,  when  most  businesses  cease  their  operation.  The  
Figure 2. t 
pattern could suggest at a frst glance the fact that the predatory  publishers are indeed located in such countries, and not in other  countries, such as the Muslim countries, where the weekend  includes Fridays and Saturdays. However, this is more likely to  be an adaptive strategy, meaning that the predatory publishers  adapt their campaigns to the Western Christian in order to avoid  the automatic deletion of their e-mails from the Spam folder  before they are reviewed, since most people do not check their  e-mail, especially the work address, during the weekends. 
Beall31  suggested that predatory publishers appeared as a  dishonest business response to the opportunity ofered by the  open access, exploiting it to their beneft. however, the frst  ones used in the beginning the excuse that since researchers are  funded for the study that yielded the results they are publishing,  they are charging the funding agency, and not the authors11.  This is true especially since science has become a business13,34,  and, as suggested previously13, returning to the way of doing  science for science will put the predatory publishers scam to  a defnite end. At the same time, the pressure for publishing  – “publish or perish” – creates a need that can be exploited  through the predatory journals10,13. This pressure is amplifed  by metrics-based promotion and graduation criteria, especially  on  exclusivist  choices13,35,36,  and  casts  doubts  over  the  peer  review process itself37,38. 
4.  ConCluSIonS And ReCoMMendAtIonS 
The article attempted to compare ‘traditional’ spam and  calls  for  papers  and  review  received  recently,  in  order  to  pinpoint the common features. In summary, a concealed, fake  or disguised identity of the sender or identity of the message,  its mass character, a missing or not working opt-out option and  a commercial focus are the main ones, mostly corresponding  to the defnition of spam; they should trigger immediately the  attention  of  researchers.  From  a  theoretical  standpoint,  the  fndings  bring  additional  evidence  to  the  fact  that  predatory  publishers  are  part  of  the  worldwide  scam,  and  should  be  ‘convicted’ in a similar way, including by legal action. 
Apart from the additional evidence on the practices used  by predatory journals, the fndings can be used for phrasing the  following recommendations. 
For the Researchers: A set of criteria used to check the  possible “predatory” character of a publisher has been developed  by Beall5. Although the resulting list is controversial39,40, the  criteria should fag the attention of a researcher when receiving  a call from an unknown journal. In addition to it, several criteria  characterising the e-mail call could be added: (a) concealed,  fake or disguised identity of the sender and/or of the message,  (b) suggestions of mass mailing (the receiver is not listed at  all in the “To” feld), (c) missing or useless opt-out option, (d)  use of commercial words  (focus  on fee, requirements to act  urgently). Any call for papers from a journal should be treated  with suspicion, because legitimate journals are approached by  authors who know them, instead of soliciting articles. 
For the Policy Makers: In diferent countries, the quality  control  of  scientifc  production  is  carried  out  either  in  a  
ime distribution of calls from predatory publishers centralised fashion, through a national authority (e.g., Ministry)  and  proofing  service  providers  received  during that  sets  out  the  criteria  for  academic/scientifc  promotion,

institutions etc., or in a decentralised way, where each research  and academic institution sets out its inner criteria. Regardless  of  it,  the  deciders  should  ban  the  predatory  publishers  and  develop  criteria  based  more  on  the  intrinsic  quality  of  the  articles  instead  of  enforcing  or  favoring  the  publication  in  “international” or “foreign” journals. Perhaps it the time for  replacing the paradigm of ‘science as business’ to the old way  of doing ‘science for science’. Putting money into the equation  increases  the  chances  of  opportunists,  such  as  the  predatory  publishers. 
For  the  Libraries:  In  many  countries,  libraries  have  an  active  role  in  supporting  researchers  with  information  on  preparing  their  manuscript  for  publication,  the  peer  review  process  and  the  post-publication  issues.  In  this  context,  libraries should also devote courses and informative materials  on dealing with the predatory journals and identifying potential  predatory publishers from the very frst stage of the “Call for  Papers”. Although debatable, Beall’s criteria, completed with  those identifed in this research, can serve as a staring point,  drawing the attention of researchers on the potential danger. 
The  predatory  publishers  are,  by  analogy  with  biology,  a  “species”  that  proliferates  beyond  the  lifetime  of  a  given  journal or publishers. When articles or lists (e.g., Beall’s list)  reveal their practices, or when they are unable to draw authors,  these journals change their names, re-invent as proofreading  services, or change their strategies. Due to this, the research  on predatory journals is rapidly “perishing”, and even though  particular  journals  are  reveled  at  some  point,  the  results  are  loosing  their  object  rapidly.  One  way  of  overcoming  this  shortcoming is an analysis of criteria used to pinpoint potential  predators. Since the resemblance of predatory publishers and  spam-based  business  suggests  their  joint  operation,  future  researches should look for their common “source”.

Date: Monday, December 11, 2017 11:20 AM Subject: HELLO, 
Hello my dear, 
I sent this mail praying for it to reach you in good health, since I  myself are in a very critical health condition in which I sleep every  night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am  mrs. lisa ragnvard Farouk, a widow sufering from brain tumor.  I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of  ($  11,000,000.00,  Eleven  Million  Dollars).  my  Doctor  told  me  recently that I would not last due to the illness. Having known my  condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will  utilise it the way i am going to instruct here in. I need a very honest  and god fearing person who can claim this money and use it for  Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools for  less privilege that will be named after my late husband if possible.  I accept this decision because I am not afraid of death. 
I am waiting for your prompt reply. (lisaragward10@gmail.com) Thank you and god bless you, 
Mrs. Lisa Ragnvard Farouk.
