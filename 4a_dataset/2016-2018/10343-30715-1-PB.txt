ABASTRACT 
The present study seeks to examine the growth of Indian research journals indexed by SCImago Journal  and Country Ranking, based on SCOPUS data sources. The study covers the period 2005-2014. Some of the key  aspects projected in the study includes, the distribution of Indian research journals indexed by SCOPUS during the  last decade, annual corresponding growth of journals indexed, subject wise distribution of Indian journals indexed,  India’s share percentage of journals indexed by SCOPUS both at the continental and the global level. The study  also examines the distribution of journals and their growth at the subject level. From the analysis, it emerged that  India is the 6th  largest country to have maximum (452) journals indexed by the SCImago citation index. Of the total  journals indexed by SCOPUS 1.97% are from India. The overall indexing of Indian journals during the decade has  recorded a growth of 131.79%, but the number is very abysmal, when compared to the number of journals indexed  from other smaller European countries. At the continental level (Asia), 16.95% journals indexed are from India.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
India  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  economies  in  the  world1.  Post  1990  India  has  seen  expansion  in  almost  all  the  spheres  of  human  activity  and  research  is one of the areas, which received flip, following some  liberal  funding  earmarked  for  the  research  all  across  the  country  by  the  government  of  India  during  each  successive  financial  year.  India’s  contribution  to  the  global  research  output  gets  assessed  from  the  fact  that  a  total  of  20625  research  articles  were  published  by  the Indian researchers in the SCImago indexed research  journals during the year 1996, which constituted 1.91% of  the  total  global  research  output  of  1996  and  in  terms  of  research  output  the  country  was  placed  as  the  13th  largest  research  country  in  the  world.  Of  the  total  2984578  research  articles  published  in  the  SCImago  indexed journals during the year 2014, India contributed  as  many  as  114449  research  articles,  which  constitutes  3.83% of the total global research output, resulted India  to become the 6th   largest  research  country  in  the  world.   If  we  look  at  the  gross  research  contribution  of  India  to  the  global  research  output  during  the  last  16  years,  then,  of  the  total  36837345  research  articles  published  all across the globe in SCImago indexed journals, Indian  researchers have contributed as many as 998544 research  articles,  which  constitutes  meager  0.29%  of  the  total  global research output, making Indian as the 9th   largest  contributor  of  the  global  research  output.  During  the  last  16  years  Indian  has  recorded  116%  growth  in  its  
research ranking, however, given its overall contribution,  the  country  is  ranked  at  9th   place 
2.    
The  present  study  is  an  attempt  to  undertake  the  assessment  of  Indian  research  journals  indexed  by  the  SCOPUS citation index. SCOPUS is one of most popular  citation  indexes  among  the  academic,  research  &  the  scientific  community  across  the  world.  The  database  as  on date has more than 22000 journals indexed with it3,  while  as  its  nearest  rival  Web  of  Science  has  around  13000  journals  in  its  index4.  The  SCOPUS  database  titles  include,  book  series,  conference  proceedings  and  journal  titles.        
2.  REVIEW  OF  LITERATURE  
Periodicals or Journals are the age old, but the most  effective mechanism which validates the research results  and  are  crucial  for  the  growth  of  disciplines5.  There  is  a  considerable  difference  in  the  quality  of  research  journals published these days across India, to that of the  journals published a decade or so earlier. Indian journals  suffered  in  their  quality  for  decades,  especially  when  the  comparison  is  drawn  between  the  research  journals  published  from  India  to  that  of  journals  published  from  other  European  countries6.  But,  the  way,  the  Indian  IT  industry has made its presence felt on the global scene,  the Indian publishers have started switching over to the  contemporary  methods  of  publishing.  
Indexing of journals with the leading citation indexes  has somewhere become imperative to increase the visibility

of  both  the  journals  and  the  research  results  published  in  these  journals.  The  research  growth  in  the  field  of  chemistry at global level witnessed a sharp surge in the  introduction of new journals from1967-767. While studying  the indexing of Indian Science and technology journals in  the SCI for the period 1975-88. Sen & Lakshmi8, found  the  coverage  quite  discouraging.  The  researchers  found  that  the  scientific  journals  published  from  India  are  not  generally covered as they do not fulfill the basic criteria  for  inclusion  in  the  indexing  service.  The  researchers  were  also  of  the  view  that  a  slight  improvement  in  the  publishing  quality  of  these  journals  can  definitely  help  them  find  a  place  in  the  indexing  service.  
Medicine  is  one  of  the  leading  research  subjects  in  India, as more than half the medical literature produced  in the third world countries come from India alone, Sahni  et al.,9, but out of 113 journals published in the field of  Medicine only 22 were indexed with Index Medicus. The  researchers  found  that,  of  the  total  literature  produced  in  the  field  of  medical  science  by  the  medicos  of  India  more  than  98%  articles  probably  go  unnoticed  by  the  international medical community.  The study highlighted  the  need  for  undertaking  quality  research  and  indexing  of  quality  journals  in  the  popular  indexing  services  for  greater  visibility.  
The Indexing state of Indian social science periodicals  with the social science indexing services is also not that  encouraging. Parvathaama10   while studying the databases  like Socifile, EconLIT, LISA and PsyLit found that of the  total journals published in the subject fields of Sociology,  Economics, Library and Information Science and Psychology  only  9.2%  were  indexed  with  these  databases.  Satish11,  the  coverage  of  Indian  literature  by  the  sociological  and  international  political  science  abstracting  services  produced in the periodicals of social sciences published  across  India  was  not  also  that  encouraging.    To  study  the impact factor of journals Solari & Magri12  undertook  the  analysis  of  4779  journals,  indexed  by  the  Institute  for  Scientific  Information  (ISI).  Open  access  journals  are  increasingly  becoming  popular  among  the  scientific  community.  More  than  4200  open  access  journals  are  indexed  with  the  SCOPUS  database13.        
3.  OBJECTIVES  
1. Assess  the  growth  of  research  journals  indexed  by  
SCOPUS citation index during the last decade viz.,  
for  the  period  2005-14. 
2. Reflect  the  percentage  share  of  Indian  journals  
indexed  by  SCOPUS,  both  at  continental  and  the  
global  level.  
3. Assess  the  subject  wise  distribution,  growth  and  
share  percentage  of  Indian  journals  indexed  by  
SCOPUS.  
4.  mEThOLOgy 
To  undertake  the  present  study,  data  were  retrieved  
52 
from the official website of SCImago Journal and Country  Ranking  on  March  31,  2016  at  1459  hrs  IST.  The  data  can be viewed, downloaded or cross checked at (http:// www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?area=0&category= 0&region=all&year=all&order=it&min=0&min_type=it).  Keeping  in  view  the  objectives  of  the  study,  the  data  was  put  to  structuration,  as  the  data  upon  retrieval  was  in  semi-structured  form.  In  Table  2  some  subject  fields  have  been  merged  together,  like  Psychology  has  been  merged with Social Sciences. Similarly subject areas like,  Dentistry, Health Profession, Immunology & Microbiology,  Neuroscience,  Nursing,  Pharmacology,  Toxicology  &  Pharmaceutics  have  been  merged  with  Medicine.  Also,  Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology have been  merged  with Agriculture  and  Biological  sciences.  
4.1  Limitations  
 The titles indexed by the SCOPUS database comprises  of  the  book  series,  conference  proceedings  and  journal  titles. But, since more than 96% indexed titles are journals  as  such,  the  analysis  at  all  the  places,  under  all  the  tables has been undertaken by presuming all the titles as  journals,  and  hence  in  the  entire  paper  discussion  lasts  around  journals.  Compared  to  452  journals  reflected  in  Table-1  and  Table-2,  641  journal  titles  stand  reflected  as  189  titles  have  been  repeated  under  different  subject  fields  for  being  multidisciplinary  in  nature.  Besides,  it  was  practically  impossible  to  work  out  the  repeated  titles; even so it was further difficult to put them under  a particular subject field. So to avoid all such confusions  the  analysis  has  been  undertaken  on  the  figures  as  they  were  retrieved  against  each  individual  subject  field.  
5. INTERpRETATION, ANALySIS AND   R ESULTS 
 The analysis at most of the places has been undertaken  up to two decimal places; however, in the Table-1 at few  places  the  analysis  has  been  taken  up  to  three  decimal  places.  The  figures  have  not  been  rounded  off,  hence  may  show  slight  variation  while  computing  figures  for  100%. 
5.1 ACg-Annual  Corresponding growth percentage 
During  the  last  decade,  the  Indian  journals  indexed  by the SCOPUS citation index have increased from 195  journals  to  452  journals,  which  constitutes  a  growth  of  131.79%. The average Annual Corresponding Growth (ACG)  of  these  journals  during  the  period  of  study  remained  8.96%. A maximum of 21.66% annual corresponding growth  in the indexing of journals was observed during the year  2010  as  the  number  of  indexed  journals  increased  from  277 to 337. While as, the minimum ACG of 0.22% was  observed  in  the  year  2014,  when  only  01  journal  was  added to existing lot of indexed journals from India. From  the  year  2005  to  2010  a  study  and  continuous  growth  can  be  observed  in  the  Indian  journals  indexed  by  the  SCOPUS  citation  index.  However,  after  2010  a  steady  decline can be observed in the indexing of journals. From

the  analysis,  it  emerges  that  in  the  2010  a  saturation  level  was  observed  in  the  indexing  of  journals.      
While  drawing  comparisons  between  the  journals  indexed  by  SCOPUS  from  India  with  that  of  journals  indexed  from  the Asia  and  the  rest  of  the World  during  the  same  period,  it  emerges  that  compared  to  overall  131.79% growth of Indian journals indexed by SCOPUS,  only  76.43%  growth  was  recorded  from  the  Asia  and  33.03% from the rest of the world during the same period.   However,  on  average,  38.16%  growth  was  recorded  at  the  global  level  in  the  indexing  of  journals  during  the  period  of  study.  Compared  to  8.96%  average  annual  corresponding  growth  of  journals  indexed  by  SCOPUS  from India, 5.91% average ACG was recorded from Asia  and 2.90% of average ACG was recorded for the rest of  the  world.  While  as,  on  average,  3.29%  average  ACG  was  recorded  at  the  global  level.  
India’s  share  percentage  at  the  continental  level  increased from 12.90% in 2005 to 17.12% in 2013 with an  average annual share of 15.10% at the continental level.  Similarly, the share percentage of Indian journals at the  global level increased from 1.17% in 2005 to 1.97% by  the  end  of  2014.  The  average  annual  share  percentage  of  Indian  journals  indexed  by  SCOPUS  during  the  last  decade  remained  1.58%.  
After  Europe  and  North America, Asia  is  the  third  largest continent to have a maximum number of journals  (10.41%) indexed with the database. In 2010, a maximum  number  of  journals  were  indexed  by  the  database  at  all  levels,  hence  recorded  with  the  highest  ACG.  The  ACG  of  journals  indexed  in  2010  remained  21.66%  for  India,  11.94%  for  Asia  and  5.31%    for  the  rest  of  the  world. Accordingly,  at  the  global  level,  in  the  year  2010  a  maximum  of  6.27% ACG  was  recorded. As  per  the  2014  figures  of  the  database,  India’s  share  of  the  journals indexed by the database at the continental level  is 16.95%, while as the share percentage of India at the  global  level  is  1.97%.

Due to various multidisciplinary journals, 189 journals  stand  repeated  under  different  subject  fields,  taking  the  overall  number  of  journals  under  various  subject  fields  to 641 titles. Medicine (249), Agriculture and biological  sciences, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology  (104) and social sciences (41) are the three leading subject  fields  from  India,  which  have  the  maximum  number  of  journals  indexed  by  SCOPUS.  The  overall  average  annual corresponding growth of Indian journals indexed  by SCOPUS during the period of study remained 8.96%,  while as the subject field like Economics, Econometrics  & Finance, Computer & Decision Science and Business  Management  and  Accounting  the  three  leading  subject  fields, recorded the maximum 46.85%, 22.14% & 20.39%  average  annual  corresponding  growth  at  the  subject  level respectively.  Subject fields like, Multidisciplinary  subject, Engineering and Physics & Astronomy recorded  the  minimum  3.66%,  4.06%  &  5.24%  average  ACG  respectively.  
At  the  national  level,  of  the  total  indexed  journals,  Medicine  has  the  maximum  38.84%  share  percentage,  followed by Agriculture and biological sciences, Biochemistry,  Genetics and Molecular Biology 16.22% and Engineering  7.2%. Accordingly, Energy (1.11%), Economics, Econometrics  and Finance (1.17%) and Veterinary Sciences (1.29%) are  the  three  subject  fields,  which  have  the  minimum  share  of  journals  indexed  by  SCOPUS  from  India.  
Subject fields like Business, Management & Accounting,  Computer  Science,  Mathematics,  Physics  &  Astronomy  and Social Science are some of the key disciplines from  India, which have shown some considerable improvement  in  the  indexing  of  their  journals  during  the  last  decade.  Energy  has  the  minimum  (06)  journal  indexed  with  the  database.

DJLIT, VOL.  37,  NO.  1,  JANUARY  2017 
are  being  increasingly  preferred  by  the  researchers  all  across the globe to publish their research results.  Addition  of nearly 9% journals annually with the SCOPUS citation  index somewhere pushes for the greater need to improve  the  quality  of  research  journals  published  across  India.   
The subject fields like, Dentistry, Decision Science,  Economics,  Econometrics  &  Finance,  Energy,  Health  Profession,  Multidisciplinary,  Neuroscience,  Nursing,  Psychology  and  Veterinary  Sciences  have  less  than  ten  journals indexed with the database. There is a far greater  need for these subject fields to work hard on improving  the quality of research journals to increase their number.  A good number of journals from all these subject fields  can find a place in the leading citation indexes provided  they  frame  a  rigorous  policy  towards  reviewing  the  research  articles  for  quality  research  publishing.  
As  per  2014  figures  of  the  SCImago,  India  is  the  third largest country to have indexed a maximum number  of  journals  from  Asia.  Only  96  journals  were  indexed  from  India  with  the  database  in  1996,  which  increased  to  452  by  the  end  of  2014,  whereby,  India  jumped  to  become  the  3rd   largest  country  at  the  continental  level  and  6th   largest  country  at  the  global  level.  
Arunachalam  &  Markanday14   discussed  about  the  island effect, whereby the coverage & scope of the journal  is  generally  seen  limited  to  the  local  interests.    This  in  fact  is  one  of  the  prime  reasons;  where  by  journals  fail  to  make  it  to  leading  indexing  services.  Indexing  of  journals with leading databases like the Web of Science  or SCOPUS, etc., has to fulfill some quality parameters  to  be  the  part  of  the  global  scientific  community.    
By and large, the position of India at the continental  level  remained  same  since  1996.  India  was  the  third  largest research contributor from Asia in 1996 and it still  enjoys  the  same  place,  after  China  and  Japan.  During  all  these  years,  it  is  China  which  has  replaced  Japan  from  the  top  place.  In  terms  of  research  contribution,  of  the  total  documents  published  across  the  Asiatic  region  in  1996,  12.28%  were  from  India,  while  as  the  India’s  share  percentage  of  total  publication  in  2014  remained 12.80%, which is just a marginal gain in terms  of  percentage.  However,  the  number  of  documents  has  increased from 20625 research articles in 1996 to 114449  articles  in  2014.  
Indian  publisher  need  to  focus  on  indexing  their  research  journals  with  the  leading  citation  indexes  and  this  is  something,  which  they  cannot  achieve  without  publishing  quality  research  articles  in  their  research  journals. The editors somewhere have to follow a rigorous  peer  review  policy  and  include  the  research  article  for  publication only if it satisfies all the different laid down  parameters.  It  is  these  parameters,  which  the  editors  of  the  research  journals  have  to  meet  before  sending  a  request  to  the  leading  citation  indexing  databases  for  including the name of their journal in the list of indexed  journals. The Indian publishers have to forget about the  
56 
quantity of articles they publish in their research journal  and should focus more on the quality of research articles  they  publish.
