1. INTRODUCTION 
Education and learning have always been the agents of  social  change  by  transforming  human  behaviour.  If  we  turn  the  pages  of  history,  we  would  see  that  learning  changed  slowly. This gradual change has led to the emergence of some  sophisticated  technology  assisted  learning  processes,  which  initially  met  with  resistance  by  educationists  regarding  the  fact that introducing computers into classrooms would replace  the  human  efforts  which  is  one  of  the  main  instruments  of  educational infrastructure. But the benefts that ICT offers are  somewhat quite diffcult to ignore and in the last few decades  technology assisted teaching and learning process have turned  out to be highly productive with a rapid pace. 
The latest advancement in world wide web (WWW) has  greatly  transformed  the  communication  system.  People  can  easily access the information and communicate with each other  within a short span of time in a single window with the help  of modern technologies1. The social networking sites (SNSs)  is a massive contribution of modern technology, and now it’s  gained much of success in the feld of communication. SNSs  is  an  interactive  communication  platform  where  people  can  connect with one another and share their thought, experiences,  pictures, audio, video, chatting via text messages, audio call,  video  call,  and  getting  information  from  others2.  However,  Tiryakioglu & Erzurum3 defned social network as ‘an online  service,  platform,  or  area  where  social  communication  and

relations  can  be  established,  and  also  individuals  share  information.  Social  networks  offer  the  user  ability  to  share  online  their  views,  feelings,  activities,  events,  and  felds  of  interest’ The foremost advantage of SNSs’ is that anyone can  create a public or semi-public profle within a bounded system,  connect  with  others  and  communicate with  each  other4;  and  view and traverse their list of connections and those made by  others within the system5. 
Since  the  introduction,  social  networking  sites  have  attracted  especially  teenagers  and  university  students6.  Nowadays, everyone prefers to use SNSs in our society such  as  educators,  businessman,  socialist,  etc.  for  communication  purposes. It helps to provide informal education for students  and  teachers  outside  of  the  classroom.  Although,  Buzzetto- More7 stated that ‘Social networking services are increasingly  being  used  by  educators  as  teaching  and  learning  tools  that  supplement  traditional  classroom  environments  as  they  provide  new  opportunities  for  enriching  existing  curriculum  through  creative,  authentic  and  fexible  non-linear  learning  experience’.

The present study examines the use of social networking  sites as an educational purpose among postgraduate students  at the University of Rajshahi. Try to investigate that what  role  SNSs  is  playing  among  students  in  their  academic  activities. The  fndings  of  this  study  will  serve  as  a  great  impression  for  the  coming  generations  to  improve  their  knowledge  and  utilisation  of  social  networking  tools  for  academic purposes.  
3. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
During last ten years, a large number of studies had been  conducted  by  researchers  throughout  the  world  regarding  ‘Social  Networking  Sites’.  Here,  authors  discussed  few  relevant studies which are related to the major theme of this  study.  Number  of  researchers3-5,13-15   stated  that  use  of  social  networking  tools  in  learning  can  prove  as  a  boon  of  course  only if the society starts thinking about it differently and use it  for productive purposes rather than chatting all the time. 
3.1 Significance  of  Social  Networking  Sites  in  
Higher  Education 
Social networking sites has become very popular during  the  past  few  years.  It  plays  an  important  role  in  our  life  nowadays.  SNSs  helps  us  in  the  every  feld  of  life  such  as  political feld, economic feld, and educational feld. as well as  in the feld of e-learning, the social networking sites handled  the  big  problem  raised  by  educators  in  the  recent  period16.  According  to  Nicole17   ‘Social  networks  build  social  capital,  where students are supported by, and participate in, learning  communities  infuenced  by  social  discourse  and  symbolic  interactions  providing  students  with  social,  emotional,  and  cognitive support. Fulflling various social learning functions  through  collaboration  and  students  to  like-minded  learners  and  building  students’  communication  and  technology  skills  and understanding different points of view’. Schlenkrich and  Sewry13  reported that students are very likely use especially  Facebook for several purposes like ‘to keep in touch with old  school  friends,  to  check  out  someone  they  met  socially  and  learn  about  people  they  are  interested  in,  to  fnd  out  about  people  in  their  classes,  to  organise  team  meetings,  to  use  Facebook to meet new people, learn about their lecturers and  
to fnd out about university assignments’. Islam and Mostofa18 found that the use of Facebook would be a supplementary tool  in the university education system.  
3.2 Usage  of  Social  Networking  Sites  throughout  
the World 
hamat19,  et al.  found that a large number of Malaysian  university students spend their time for using social networking  sites. Notably, students use SNSs because it is a platform where  students can interact and communicate with their peers for the  purpose  of  informal  learning  and  consulting  their  doubts  to  their tutors/lecturers. The interesting fnding come out from this  study that majority of the students believe for using maximum  time  on  SNSs  do  not  affect  their  academic  performance.   hassan & Landani20  found that most of the students use SNSs  less  than  an  hour  daily. They  also  reported  that  ‘SNS  allow  students not only to expand relationships beyond the classroom  but also to improve their communication skills’. 
haneefa & Sumitha1  revealed that majority of the students  are aware about social networking sites and using these sites for  communication with their friends, family, teachers, and also for  academic purpose. authors also noted that ‘social networking  sites  can  be  used  as  an  interactive  platform  for  academic  communication and can be a source of information, knowledge  and  help’. vaidigi  &  Munshi14   found  that  social  networking  tools had made a great impact on the social science students  at AMU. Through these tools students can easily share online  information, University news, new arrivals in central library,  etc. Students are also connected through these tools with their  peers to clear their doubts, opinions, and thoughts about their  subject matters. Munshi15  discovered that the majority of the  students  are  ‘highly  independent  on  Internet  communication  tools and social media for their academic and communication  purposes in social life.’ However, students faced few problems  while they are accessing these tools e.g. poor connectivity, lack  of infrastructure, lack of time, etc. 
hamade21  revealed that majority of the  kuwait University  students use Twitter and Facebook most of the time. author  also found that SNSs help to make better relationship with  family, relatives, friends, teachers and more involvement in  social, political and cultural activities. Eke2,  et al.  revealed  that all the undergraduate students of University of Nigeria  using SNSs for interacting and communicating with friends  group, ‘connecting to their classmates for online study and  for discussing serious national issues and watching movies,  etc.’ another study by Fasae & Iwari22  traced the perception  regarding the use of social media for academic purposes by  science students in public universities in Southwest Nigeria.  The  study  explored  that  majority  of  them  are  aware  about  various social media applications, and Facebook is the most  preferable SNS among the other social media and second one  is Google+. Most of the students are using social media daily  for getting up-to-date information. The fndings highlighted  that google+ is the most benefcial social media followed by  Facebook  and  Wiki  for  their  academic  work. authors  also  discussed some problems faced by the students while using  social media such as slow Internet connectivity, receiving of  unwanted messages and electricity failure, etc.

purposes.  The  results  of  the  study  support  the  notion  that  students  have  a  positive  attitude  regarding  the  importance  of  SNSs  for  their  academic  purposes.  The  majority  of  the  participants strongly support that SNSs help their educational  work  and  it  builds  up  a  good  relationship  between  their  e ducators, friends and other professionals. Notably, investigators  have seen many students strongly agreed that it helps to create  the  collaborative  workstation,  where  students,  teachers,  and  professionals can discuss their problems. They get up-to-date  information  through  SNSs  and  share  their  thoughts  to  the  others. Apart from that, investigators have also found,a huge  number of respondents strongly agreed that they get various  job  information  through  SNSs.  Signifcantly,  it  is  observed  that a number of professional have created various pages on  Facebook  where  they  regularly  update  job  notifcations  in  several institutions, organisations, etc. in Bangladesh as well  as abroad. Moreover, this study demonstrates a large number  of  respondents  strongly  supported  that  SNSs  is  an  effective  media which helps to connect with each other for group studies,  discussions and social communication. In the present scenario  SNSs are the strong media which spreads any information in  few second throughout the world.
