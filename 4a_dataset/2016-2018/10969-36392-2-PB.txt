ABSTRACT 
Of late, social tagging has become popular trend in information organisation. In context of digital resources  the tags assigned by users also play vital role in information retrieval. For information discovery the ‘terms’ used  to retrieve the results also depend upon the ‘relevancy’ or ‘weightage’ of the keywords. This study investigates  ‘relevancy ranking’ of terms used in the full text of the resource. The common words present in both full text of  the article and social tags were considered for the study by employing TF-IDF statistical technique and Jaccard  similarity test. The results show that it is possible to assign ‘weight’ to keywords for better results and also determine  the signifcant tags assigned by the user. The Jaccard similarity coeffcient test adopted to understand the word  similarity between full text words of an article and marine social tags. This work reveals the social tags can enrich  
metadata for information retrieval.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
As a popular component of Web 2.0 technology, social  tagging is a new phenomenon in the organisation, management,  and discovery of digital resources. In tagging system any one  can  participate  in  the  process  and  assign  the  keywords  they  prefer. These social tags assigned by majority of participants  for  resources  are  treated  as  valuable  vocabulary  to  organise  and  share  resources  within  the  community1.  The  concept  of  social tagging is adopted by many information communities  and presently vast amount of online information is operated by  social tags as information discovery tool. The semantic value  of  social  tags  is  also  crucial  to  measure  the  performance  of  information retrieval.  
It is vital for researchers to understand the semantic and  similarity value of these social tags. This study examines the  semantic and similarity information associated with social tags  and the terms used in the full text of the research articles. It  is assumed that there is a semantic and similarity relationship  between  social  tags  and  terms  in  the  full  text  article.  The  analysis of tags exhibit the semantic similarity in information  retrieval. The social tags, author keywords, subject headings  and few important terms from the article will also enhance the  information retrieval by providing additional access points.  
This study makes an effort to understand the ‘relevance  ranking’  with  the  help  of  term  frequency-inverse  document  frequency  (TF-IDF)  and  ‘similarity’  by  employing  Jaccard  similarity  coeffcient.  TF-IDF  is  a  common  mathematical

method  of  weighing  texts  for  information  retrieval  and  automatic  indexing2.  In  this  context  of  information  retrieval  the term ‘relevance ranking’ suggests ‘statistically signifcant  search results’. It is believed that the application of statistical  analysis  against  texts  has  greater  information  retrieval  advantage over Boolean search3.   
The Jaccard index is used for comparing the similarity and  diversity of sample sets, which measures similarity between  fnite sample sets, and is defned as the size of the intersection  divided by the size of the union of the sample sets4.  Hence,  with  the  help  of  TF-IDF  and  Jaccard  index  methods  this  work will investigate the semantic and similarity analysis of  user-generated keywords of marine science full text research  articles. 
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Conventionally, information retrieval (IR) performance is  determined in terms of speed, precision and recall and these  measures  can  be  extended  to  web  IR  systems5-6.  The  main  purpose of information retrieval system is to provide users the  information  they  require  in  effcient  and  effective  way.  The  researchers are interested to fnd whether the social tags have  any such infuence in improving the retrieval performance with  respect to the traditional methods.  
It is widely accepted feature that social tagging is not only  the established method to organise and index the user generated  content but also employ them for retrieval when information is  requested7-8.

2.1 Semantic Analysis  of  Social Tags Through TF- 
IDF 
Various  studies  focuses  on  the  semantic  aspects  of  social  tagging.  Peters  and  Stock9-10   detailed  the  number  of  inconsistencies  in  social  tagging.  According  to  them  unstructured  nature  of  social  tags  create  restriction,  rather  than enhancing the results,  in information retrieval and they   proposed a criteria for relevance ranking of tagged documents  with the help of TF-IDF.  
yi11   devised  a  conceptual  frame  work  for  information  retrieval for folksonomy on the basis of Library of Congress  Subject  Headings  (LCSH).  He  proposed  TF-IDF  algorithm  to  fnd  the  similarities  between  folksonomies  and  subject  headings.  yi12  again investigated  the  ways  of  predicting  relevant  subject  headings  from  resources  from  social  tags  assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings  was  measured  by  TF-IDF.  Zubiaga13,  et  al.  performed  a  tag  based  resource  classifcation  study  by  adopting  TF- IDF  weighting  scheme.  The  researchers  found  that  the  tag  distribution in social tags can help to determine the relevance  of tags and hence useful retrieval. Studies show that TF-IDF is  one of the popular statistical tool used to fnd out the relevance  tags to enhance search results in information retrieval. 
2.2 Similarity Analysis  Through  Jaccard  Coefficient  
Method 
Jaccard similarity analysis is one of the popular method to  determine the similarity coeffcient between two set of datasets.  Heyman and Garcia-Molino14  in their comparison work of tags  with  controlled  vocabularies  by  adopting  Jaccard  similarity  method,  observed  that  many  of  the  keywords  designated  by  the tags and controlled vocabularies are similar or the same but  the usage of keywords by annotators are different.  
Jaccard  index  method  is  being  used  in  determining  the  similarity between tags and controlled vocabularies15-17. These  researchers  found  that  it  was  essential  to  use  the  Jaccard  similarity index to compare social tags and subject terms. The  results reveal that the social tags and controlled vocabularies  are  quite  distinct  lexically  and  semantically,  refecting  the  different viewpoint and processes between them. It was found  the lexical overlap between the two sets of data was marginal.  However, despite limitations, the social tags have the potential  to become a complementary source to expand and enrich the  controlled vocabulary system.   
yi12   investigated  the  ways  to  predict  relevant  subject  headings  for  resources  from  social  tags  assigned  to  the  resources. The predication of subject headings was measured  by  Jaccard  similarity  method.  This  study  demonstrated  the  application of similarity technique to predict correct Library of  Congress Subject Headings.   
These  studies  indicate  the  importance  of  TF-IDF  and  Jaccard  similarity  in  context  of  information  retrieval,  knowledge organisation and metadata enrichment. 
3.  RESEARCH  OBJECTIVES 
In  this  study,  an  attempt  is  made  to  answer  following  research objectives. 
(a) Is  it  possible  to  assign  weights  to  search  results  and  
12 
arrange them statistically using TF-IDF? 
(b) Is it possible to weigh terms and provide relevance ranking  
without knowing the semantic meaning of a word in the  
index by using TF-IDF? 
(c) To what extent Social tags comprise similar vocabulary  
from the article?  
(d) To what extent readers assign similar words that the author  
uses in the article?  
The  fndings  of  this  research  work  will  enhance  the  importance  of  social  tags  for  information  retrieval  and  knowledge organisation.  
4.  SCOPE AND  LIMITATION  OF  STUDY 
In this study, the full text articles were chosen from marine  science subject. The researchers identifed the marine science  journal from where the articles were identifed then collected  the respective social tags from CiteuLike. The CiteuLike is  a social web service where users can save and share citations  to academic papers. However, the care was taken that full text  of  the  article  was  available  for  analysis.  In  this  context,  we  considered three full text articles from the open access journal  Ocean Science where users have assigned minimum ten tags  to these articles.

5.  METHODOLOGY 
To determine social semantic and similarity values of the  text the methodology adopted is both term frequency-inverse  document frequency (TF-IDF) and Jaccard similarity test. In  this perspective, the data was collected as described below. 
The tags extracted were transferred to MS Excel sheet and  arranged them as required for the study. Table 1 gives the nature  of data collected for this study. The full text articles chosen  for the study were converted to wordlist by removing the stop  words (the, an, a) used in the article. For example, in Table  1,  the  document  1  consists  of  8082  words.  Instead  of  using  just title, keywords and abstract, the full text mining creates  extra diffculties and noise. Hence after processing, the terms  were  reduced  to  1268.  The  acknowledgement  part,  authors’  name and emails, references were omitted from the full text to  analyse only the academic part of the scientifc work18. 
The  social  tags  provided  by  users  were  also  split  into  single word to make more precise in composition. For example  ‘Geostrophic-turbulence’  was  split  into  two  separate  words  like ‘geostrophic’ and ‘turbulence’19. It is quite obvious that by  splitting the words the chance of fnding common words will  increase. The word list also gives an advantage of fnding the  frequency of the words appeared in the document. The wordlist  of  the  article  were  compared  to  fnd  common  terms  among  the  corpus  created.  The  common  words  were  considered  in  setting  up  the  calculation  as  these  words  are  contributed  by

both author and users. The tags annotated  by user and the terms used by author in  the  article  will  provide  the  researcher  to  fnd the ‘signifcant terms’ for information  retrieval.  Taking  such  an  approach-the  application  of  statistical  analysis  against  texts- does have its information retrieval  advantages over straight Boolean logic3.

6.  ANALYSIS AND  INTERPRETATION 
6.1 TF-IDF  for  Sematic Analysis 
TF-IDF  is  a  conventional  term  weighting  method  as  well  as  a  fundamental  way  of  documenting  similarity  based  on mathematical Boolean operations. This is regularly applied  method in the feld of information retrieval. In simple words,  TF of a term in a document is the number of occurrences of  the term in the document. TF is usually normalised over the  size of a document to provide standardised measure regarding  document  size.  DF  is  the  number  of  documents  in  which  a  term occurs in a corpus of documents. IDF which measures  how important the term is. While computing TF all terms are  considered equally important. However it is known that certain  terms, such as ‘is’, ‘of’, and ‘that’, may appear a lot of times  but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the  frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing IDF  (t)  = log 
with term t 
e(Total number of documents / Number of documents  
 in it)   
The basic assumption of DF in TF-IDF is that as a term  appears in fewer distinct documents, the value of the term in  DF increases so that it holds more weight in TF-IDF. 
Therefore TF and IDF are calculated as follows for this  research work. 
resultant TF-IDF for this query in all documents would be as  mentioned in Table 4.

For  the  three  documents  selected  for  this  work  the  statistical analysis divulges very signifcant results.  
In document 1, we could fnd 27 common terms provided  by  both  user  and  author  of  the  article.  The  word  ‘salinity’  appeared  128  times  followed  by  ‘data’  with  74  times  in  the  article. In document 2, ‘layer’ and ‘deep’ were top two terms  whereas  ‘sea’  and  ‘straight’  were  most  preferred  term  in  document 3. In whole of these three documents we could fnd  three common terms (water, ocean, and interannual) in doc 1  and doc 2 and then two words (terms, circulation) in doc 2 and  doc 3. The present study uses these words for further analysis.  
TF and IDF for doc 1 and doc 2 for terms ‘water’, ‘ocean’,  and ‘interannual’ are as shown in Table 2. For doc 3 the results  will be 0, in absence of any common terms between doc. 1 and  3. Similarly TF and IDF for doc 2 and doc 3 for words ‘terms’  and ‘circulation’. 
For doc 1 the results will be 0 in absence of any common  words between doc 3 and doc 1. It is now observed that if there  is any query like ‘water circulation’ then all three documents  will  be  in  search  for  the  retrieval  of  the  results.  Hence  the  
With  TF-IDF  analysis  another  important  observation  
is manifested in this research work. In document 1 the word  
‘water’  appears  54  times  and  another  word  ‘variability’  
appears 41 times. But in list of relevance words ‘variability’  
fnds 4th  place and ‘water’ much below in the list. Hence the  
word  ‘variability’  is  more  in  weight  than  ‘water’  because  
‘water’ appears in two documents and is considered as less in  
relevance. This statistical analysis defnitely helps to enhance  
the information retrieval results.  
We can also surely distinguish between all words in the  
respective documents in terms of their relevance. Given such a  
list, it is possible to take frst three terms from each document  
and call them most signifcant subject tags. TF-IDF also works  
rightly in the context of enhancing and enriching metadata of  
the resources to facilitate retrieval with speed and precision.  
For document 1 the list of signifcant words is presented  
in graphical format to understand it better. In this given order  weightage distribution of the tags is obtained.

6.2 Similarity Analysis  by  Jaccard  Similarity  
Method 
The  Jaccard  similarity  coeffcient  is  used  to  measure  
the similarity between the frequent sets of tags and the terms  employed  in  the  article15   and  is  calculated  according  to
