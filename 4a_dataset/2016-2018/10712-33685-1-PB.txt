The paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the 4821 cited documents appended to the 295 articles published in  DJLIT  during 2011-15. The citation analysis is based on various strictures such as studying distribution of citations,  authorship pattern, degree of collaboration, distribution of reference sources, prominent authors and ranked list of  core journals. The study revealed that there is dominance of single authorship with 1912 (39.65%) citations followed  by two authors with 1152 (23.89%) citations, three authors with 456 (9.45%) citations and more than three authors  with 386 (8%) citations. There has been the availability of a good degree of institutional publications as well.  Year-wise authorship pattern is also specifed so as to see the dominance of particular authorship pattern for the  period considered under the study. The degree of authors’ collaboration for the present study is 0.51 and modifed  collaborative coeffcient is 0.3661. Dr B.M. Gupta with 52 citations is the most prolifc author. Dr K.C. Garg and  Dr B.S. Kademani are at the second and third position respectively.  The study further exposed the journal to be the  mostly cited information source 2560 (53.10%) followed by websites (22.69%) and books (10.81%). Conference  papers, reports, theses, workshop papers and seminar papers equally seem to be preferred domain with regard to using  pertinent information source. Ranked list of journals denotes Scientometrics to be the most used journal (6.60%)  by the authors contributing in DJLIT. The source journal is at the second position in the ranked list with 5.43%. A  glance at the ranked core list of journals suggests that maximum journals are from foreign countries.

1.  INtRODUCtION 
Citation  analysis  is  the  area  of  bibliometrics  which  deals  with  the  study  of  relationship  between  citing  document  and  citing  document1.  Weinstock2   observes  that  scientific  tradition  requires  that  when  a  reputable  scientist  or  technologist  publishes  an  article,  he  should  refer  to  earlier  articles,  which  relate  to  his  theme.  Garfield  has  enumerated  15  excellent  reasons  as  to  why an author should do this1.  Strictly  adhering  to  this  scientific  tradition  would  be  helpful  in  studies  research  evaluation  and  science  policy  which  is  ultimately  the  aim  of  citation  analysis3. 
2.  LItERAtURE  REVIEW 
Some  of  the  reviews  in  the  light  of  present  study  have  been  studied  and  enumerated  as  follows: 
Jan4  did the citation analysis of 593 articles published in  Library Trends  during 1994-2007. Out of 15662 references,  13783 were p-citations  and 1879 were  e-citations. Each  issue  published  approximately  11  articles. Although  the  journals  outnumbered  the  books  and  other  resources  in  the total citation received, yet aggregated figure showed  the  difference  of  books  and  journals  citation  was  in  decimal fraction. Largest number of conference proceeding  were cited in the year 1999. The researcher hardly used  e-books as a reference source. Very less number 11.86%  e-journals  were  cited  against  88.14%  of  other  resource  
Received 30 September 2016, online published 30 June 2017 
types during the 14 years. The female contributions with  52.34% accounted more than male contribution (47.66%)  as they contributed more than 60% during the year 1996,  1998,  2005-2007. 
Deshmukh5   analysed  4141  citations  appended  to  articles published in ‘Annals of Library and Information  Studies’  during  1997  to  2010.  He  found  that  maximum  citation,  i.e.,  2258  (54.34%)  were  from  journals  in  which source journals leaded with 11.12%. The half life  of  LIS  literature  was  found  to  be  9  years  for  journals  and  14  years  for  books  respectively. The  ratio  of  single  authorship  was  more  in  the  case  of  books  (70.52%)  as  compared  to  journals  (52.7%). 
Kumar  &  Moorthy6   performed  the  bibliometric  analysis of DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information  Technology   during  2001-2010.  The  result  indicated  that  maximum  number  of  papers  (37.6%)  were  from  single  authors  followed  by  two-authored  papers  (36.9%).  The  Web/internet  was  increasingly  cited  information  source  which the authors thought was keeping in tune with the  era  of  IT.  However,  journals  got  the  first  place  1382  with  (40.31%)  citations.  Dr  B.M.  Gupta  stood  out  to  be  the  prominent  author.    In  case  of  institution-wise  distribution  of  papers,  Universities  ranked  first  with  139  contributions  followed  by  Government  or  Research  institutions  which  had  104  contributions  to  their  credit.  The  average  length  of  papers  was  6-10  pages.

While  doing  the  Citation  analysis  of  Collection  Building, Har Singh7  consulted 179 articles from 8volumes  (2005-2012)  which  carried  2388  citations  including  85  self-citations.  With  regard  to  range  and  percentage  of  citation  per  articles,  a  total  54  (30.17%)  articles  topped  the  list  with  between  10  to  19  citations.  Authorship  pattern showed the trend towards single authorship with  118  (65.92%),  followed  by  two  authors  50  (27.93%).  It  is  through  Subramanian’s  formula,  the  author  deduced  that degree of collaboration in ‘Collection Building’ was  from  0.23  to  0.50.  253  authors  contributed  179  articles  in  which  Kanwal,  Ameen  from  pakistan  was  found  to  be  the  most  prolific  authors.  Most  of  the  contributors  were from uSA followed by Canada and India. Maximum  119  (66.48%)  articles  were  between  six  to  ten  pages  followed  by  46  (25.7%)  articles  between  one  to  five  pages.  The  ranking  of  source  materials  indicated  that  journals  were  the  mostly  cited  information  source  with  maximum  1020  (42.71%)  citations.  The  source  journal  ‘Collection  Building’  leaded  with  92  (9.02%)  citations  stood  at  the  top  in  the  ranked  list  of  1020  journals. 
Singh & Bedi8   in  their  study  analysed  the  citations  affixed in the theses of Sociology, accepted by university  of  Delhi  during  1995-2010.  The  study  revealed  that  researchers  in  Sociology  used  books  mostly  for  their  research than any other information source. It is surprising  that web resources did not get any citations. With regard  to  country-wise  and  city-wise  scattering  of  citations,  India ranked first with 45.98% citations and New Delhi  ranked first having 24.48% citations respectively. Oxford  University Press dominated with 440 publications (30.17%)  followed  by  Sage  publication  with  200  publications  (13.71%) in case of publisher-wise scattering of citations.  In  ranked  list  of  the  journals  both  Indian  Journals  of  Economic and  Political  Weekly   with  137  (10.70%)  and  Indian  Journal  of  Psychiatry   with  98  (7.66%)  got  the  maximum  citations.  Single  authors  received  maximum  citations  (83.94%)  than  the  collaborative  authors. 
Patra9   examined  the  citation  pattern  of  Indian  lIS  journals through Google Scholar to know the strength and  weakness  of  Indian  LIS  journals.  The  average  citations  of  Indian  lIS  journals  varied  from  maximum  4.21  to  minimum  0.29  with Annals  of  Library  and  Information  Studies   having  the  highest  citation  per  paper  (4.21%).  Single  authorship  was  found  to  be  most  common  in  all  journals  selected  for  study.  This  showed  collaborative  research  is  not  preferred  by  LIS  scholars.  However,  two-authored and three authored articles were cited more  
table 1. Distribution of citations 
than  single-authored  articles.  The  authors  opined  that  Indian  LIS  journals  were  not  maintaining  their  online  indexing  or  archiving  properly.  
3.  OBJECtIVEs 
The  study  has  been  carried  out  with  the  following  objectives  to: 
(a) Estimate  year-wise  and  volume-wise  quantitative  
growth  of  cited-articles  
(b) Find  out  quantitative  distribution  of  citations (c)   e xamine  the  authorship  pattern  and  to  identify  
prominent  authors  from  the  cited  documents (d) Know  the  type  of  reference  sources  used  by  the  
authors  in DJLIT 
(e) Scrutinise  cited  journals  so  as  to  find  out  core  
journals  using  Bradford’s  law  of  scattering 
4.  MEthODOLOgy 
The  data  for  the  present  study  has  been  gathered  from  4821  citations  appended  to  the  295  citing  articles  published in DJLIT  during 2011-2015. The articles were  accessed  in  print  form  and  which  were  not  available  in  print were accessed through the archive available (http:// publications.drdo.gov.in/ojs/index.php/djlit/issue/archive).  The  information  with  regard  to  the  cited  documents  of  each  article  was  noted  in  MS  excel  sheet.  The  recorded  data  was  analysed  and  interpreted  using  the  excel  sheet.  While  preparing  the  ranked  list  of  the  journals,  website  (www.scimagojr.com)  was  consulted  to determine country of origin of journals. It is a portal  that includes the journals and country scientific indicators  developed from the information contained in the Scopus  database10. 
5.  DAtA ANALysIs 
5.1. Distributions  of  References 
Table 1 reflects volume-wise and year-wise citations  quoted  by  the  citing  authors.  295  articles  have  been  published during the five years which is the span of the  study.  These published articles received 4821 citations.  Most of the citations, i.e., 1011 (20.97%) appeared in the  year  2011. Although,  there  is  no  great  difference  in  the  amount  of  references  cited    every  year,  yet  from  2011  onwards  the  amount  of  cited  documents  is  decreasing  upto  2015.

5.2. Authorship  Pattern 
Figure 1 shows the authorship pattern of contributors.  Maximum contributions were single authored, i.e., 1912  (39.65%), followed by two authors (23.89%), three authors  (9.45%), more than three authors (6.55%) and corporate  authors  (6.55%).  The  collaborative  research  is  a  good  degree of visible; still there is dominance of one author,  followed by two authors. The percentage-wise graphical  display  of  authorship  pattern  is  given  as  below. 
5.3.  y ear-wise Authorship  Pattern 
Table  2  throws  light  on  the  year-wise  authorship  pattern.  Maximum  single  author  contributions  appears  in  the  year  2012,  i.e.,  410  followed  by  2013  and  2011.  Two-authors,  three-authors  and  more  then  three  authors  have contributed significantly in the year 2011 with 279,  126 and 107 articles respectively. The contributions from  corporate  authorship  are  also  significant.

5.4. Degree  of  Collaboration 
Table  3  shows  the  degree  of  authors’  collaboration  and modified collaborative coefficient in DJLIT.  It  was  calculated  by  using  Subramanyam’s11   and  Savanur  &  Srikanth’s  formula12   respectively.  Hence,  the  degree  of  collaboration  in  the  present  study  is  0.51.  There  is  no  greater  difference  in  the  degree  of  collaboration  in  all  the  years  with  the  exception  of  0.40  in  the  year  2012.  While  average  modified  collaborative  coefficient  is  0.3661.  More  than  three  authors  have  been  given  ¼  credits.  Corporate  authorship  and  others  have  not  been  taken  into  account. 
5.5.  Prominent Authors 
In  all  3904  authors  were  cited.  Table  4  lists  17  authors  which  were  cited  10  or  more  times.  Among  all  the  cited  authors  in DJLIT.  Dr  B.M  Gupta  has  got  first  rank  with  52  citations,  followed  by  Dr  K.C.  Garg  with  43,  Dr  B.S.  Kademani  with  32,  R.  Rousseau  with  22,  Dr  C.K.  Ramaiah  with  20  and  G.  prathap  with  19  citations.  
5.6.  Distributions  of  Information sources 
Table 5 shows distribution of different forms of cited  literature used by different authors during research writing.  The  table  clearly  depicts  journals  to  be  highly  cited  information source with 2560 (53.10%) citations followed  by websites 1094 (22.69%) and books with 521 (10.81%).  The citations received for reports and theses indicate that  they are important source, though they are less in numbers.  In fact, conference proceeding has been used more by the  citing authors as compared to reports and theses. It shows  how conferences have been popular nowadays and it has  been regarded as one of the important medium to spread

Table  7  reflects  Bradford  zones  and  distribution  research output in DJLIT  during the scope of the study.  When 2560 citations were divided into three Bradford’s  zone  thus  14  journals  contributing  850  articles  in  the  first  zone,  in  the  next  zone  121  journals  published  856  articles  and  next  648  journals  published  854  articles.  Bradford  stated  that  the  numbers  of  journals  following  successfully in the three zones will 1:n:n2. Hence observed  distribution is 14: 121: 648 = 783 and expected distribution  is 14: 14*6.95: 14*(6.95)2.  Here  6.95  is  the  average  of  the Bradford’s multiplier obtained by dividing the number  of  journals  titles  of  a  particular  zone  by  its  preceding  zone  (here  121/14=8.6)  and  (648/121=5.3).

average. each issue approximately contained 10 articles.  The  quantitative  growth  of  citations  is  lowering  down  from  2011  to  2015.  With  regard  to  authorship  pattern,  single  authorship  has  dominated  the  rest  of  patterns  of  collaboration.  Still  the  contributions  from  corporate  authors’  are  noteworthy.  There  share  is  6.55%.  Out  of  all the information sources, journals are the mostly cited  information  source  followed  by  websites  and  books.  The  ranked  list  gives  an  idea  about  principal  journals  in  the  discipline. 
The  present  study  is  important  in  that  it  deals  with  one  of  the  leading  Library  and  Information  Science  journals in India. The citation study of such a journal was  really  appropriate  though  the  findings  may  not  exactly  be generalised for the whole discipline as they are. This  
However, only the first core zone from Bradford as given  
study  needs  to  be  strengthened  by  more  comprehensive  
studies  inclusive  of  prominent  Library  and  Information  
in Table  8  forms  the  list  of  core  journals. 
6.  CONCLUsIONs 
The  study  divulged  that  30  issues  have  295  citing  articles.  Each  volume  published  59  articles  with  an  
268 
Science  Journals  from  India.  yet  the  findings  are  of  vital  importance  to  know  the  citation  behaviour  of  DJLIT which  may  be  useful  for  further  studies  on  this  line.
