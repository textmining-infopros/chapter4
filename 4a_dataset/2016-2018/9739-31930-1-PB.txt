Information literacy refers to the abilities of an individual in identifying, retrieving and utilising appropriate  and required information. It is the process of implementing a accurate information behaviour through proper medium  or channel to obtain the requisite information judiciously. The present study has been carried out to assess the  information literacy skills of the scholarly community of University of Kashmir. For this study, a well structured  questionnaire was administered among 100 research scholars of the University comprising of 55 male and 45 female  respondents. Out of 100 questionnaires, 99 were received back from 55 male and 44 female respondents respectively.  These 99 questionnaires were used for the present study. The result of the study reveals that information literacy  skills form an important role in the retrieval of relevant, timely and up-to-date information. After the analysis of  data some suggestions have also been given on the basis of results for the effective and proper information literacy  
among users.

1. IntRodUCtIon 
For  the  last  so  many  years,  internet  has  become  an  essential  tool  for  communication,  storage  and  retrieval  of information. With the rapid growth of knowledge and  easy access to information, internet has found prominent  place  world  over  in  the  institutions  of  research  and  higher  learning. 
Information literacy competency is an ability to seek  pertinent  information  from  various  sources  in  order  to  meet the desired needs and evaluate, analyse, communicate  and  synthesise  the  resultant  knowledge.  It  is  a  kind  of  pedagogy  based  on  certain  set  of  instructions  in  the  institutions  of  higher  learning.  In  context  of  library  and information centers, the role of information literacy  is  to  facilitate  and  inspire  the  learners  in  the  process  of  learning  throughout  life.  To  enable  the  learners  in  the  pursuit  of  information  and  knowledge,  the  aim  of  the  library  staff  is  to  aware  users  about  various  skills  of  evaluating,  identifying  and  locating  information.  In  addition to this, the information literate learners remain  confident and competent in the pursuit knowledge. They  are well aware of their information requirements and are  competent enough to deal with the ocean of information  in  the  contemporary  era  of  information  explosion. They  remain capable and barrier free in the solution of various  problems  related  to  acquisition  of  knowledge. 
In  the  present  day  world,  information  is  exiting  in  various  formats,  from  various  sources.  It  is  therefore,  important  for  the  learner  to  be  information  literate  in  order  to  remain  competent  about  the  things  like  when,

why  and  how  to  utilise  various  tools  in  the  acquisition  of  information  in  a  proper  way.  It  is  not  possible  to  become information literate overnight. Hence, it is only  by  adopting  certain  writing  and  speaking  behaviour  that  will  improve  one’s  capability  and  expertise  in  the  topics  of  his  interest  chosen  by  himself/herself.  The  users’  quest  for  pertinent  information  can  be  satisfied  by  way  of  certain  information  acquiring  talents  and  abilities  and  the  possession  of  such  skills  is  known  as  information  literacy.  The  present  study  is  an  attempt  to  analyse  various  types  of  information  skills  of  users  in  the  process  of  retrieval  of  Information  in  Libraries  and  Information  Centers.

programme. The study also highlights the role librarian’s  and  libraries  in  information  literacy. 
Cowan5  in his study discussed about the information  literacy  and  highlights  the  way  information  literacy  is  still  written  about,  presented  and  practiced  within  libraries  and  higher  education  institutions,  as  if  it  still  naturally  falls  within  the  purview  of  libraries  and  as  if  librarians  are  still,  somehow,  best  positioned  to  create  and  implement  it. 
Rafique6   has  summed  up  the  level  of  information  literacy  skills  of  faculty  members  of  the  University  of  Lahore.  The  study  indicates  that  majority  of  faculty  members  are  deficient  in  searching  catalog  and  its  use,  choice  of  information  sources,  selection  of  relevant  sources  and  formulation  of  search  strategies.  Likewise,  many  faculty  members  are  not  successful  users  of  the  university  libraries.  Parmar  &  Gohel7 have  discussed  at  length  about  the  information  literacy  competencies  for  higher  learning  and  research.  The  paper  further  expresses  about  the  important  components,  and  benefits  of  information  literacy  and  research  literacy.  
Venkataramana8  has dealt with the concept of information  literacy  and  discussed  its  need  and  importance  and  highlights the information literacy competencies standards  of  higher  education.  It  also  discusses  the  information  literacy  initiatives  at  global  level  and  emphasises  the  urgent need for the development of information literacy  programmes in Indian higher education system. Rani9  has  studied  the  role  of  college  libraries  in  the  information  literacy  concept  and  development  of  skills  related  to  information  literacy.  The  goal  of  this  study  is  to  verify  and  know  if  students  of  First-year  have  got  the  ability  to  collect,  evaluate  and  use  information.  Ramesh10 has  presented the information literacy concept and presented  indicators based on standards and performances which are  formulated  by  UNESCO  and  IFLA    related  to  libraries  of  schools  and  higher  education.  The  significance  of  information  literacy  for  public  and  school  libraries  has  been  underscored.  It  also  examines  the  information  literacy  concept  for  national  and  international  level  and  highlights  on  the  declaration  of  UNESCO  about  the  Society  of  information  literates. 
 Lastly, it emphases on policy of information literacy  in educational system of India. Eisenberg11  has provided  an overview and highlighted on importance of information  literacy  in  three  contexts: 
(a)  Process  of  information  
(b)  Context  of  technology 
(c)  Adoption  through  actual  needs  in  real  situations.  
Study  presents  an  overview  based  on  conceptual  understanding  of  information  literacy,  the  range  of  technology, models and standards within the framework  of  information  literacy  and  strategies  based  on  practice  for efficient and effective techniques of learning. It also  offers directives based on certain instructions for learning  in  relation  to  the  series  of  situations.

Information  is  the  life  blood  of  every  individual  in  a  society  and  the  only  way  to  use  information  in  a  proper way is to have proper information literacy among  all  the  citizens.  In  the  contemporary  global  world,  the  development  of  a  society  is  solely  dependent  upon  the  use  of  right,  latest,  up-to-date  and  timely  information.  It  is  therefore,  in  this  context  that  information  literacy  has great significance in libraries. Since libraries are the  store houses of knowledge/information and have always  come to play an important role in all types of societies,  it is as such important for them to ensure that the users  have  sufficient  awareness  regarding  the  availability  of  resources.
