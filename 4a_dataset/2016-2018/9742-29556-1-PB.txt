1.    IntRODuctIOn 
Radio frequency identification (RFID) can be defined  as automatic identification technology which uses radio- frequency  electromagnetic  fields  to  identify  objects  carrying  tags  when  they  come  close  to  a  reader.  Data  (identification  number  for  instance)  included  in  the  electronic  chip  of  the  RFID  label  can  be  collected  by  the  reader.  This  reader  can  also  change  the  content  of  the  label’s  memory.  However,  RFID  cannot  be  reduced  to  one  technology. The  information  contained  within  an  RFID tag’s electronic chip depends on its application. It  may  be  a  unique  identifier  (UII,  Unique  Item  Identifier  or EPC code, Electronic Product Code, etc.). From 2006  onwards,  RFID  technologies  are  now  widely  used  in  almost all industrial sectors. ISO took part in establishing  technical and applicative standards that let to have a high  degree  of  interoperability  or  interchangeability1. 
The RFID has been successfully integrated across a  wide variety of industries including animal identification,  pharmaceutical,  building  access  control,  toll  collection,  vehicle immobilization systems, aviation industry, waste  management,  and  mining  industries2-4.  RFID  provides  new  opportunities  to  use  business  intelligence  (BI)  to  monitor  organisational  operations  and  learn  more  about markets, as well as consumer attitudes, behaviors,  and  product  preferences5.  Many  IT  software  companies  in  India  have  forayed  into  RFID  technology,  offering

solutions mainly for time and attendance for SMEs. Many  respectable industry names like Siemens, Wipro, Infosys  and Honeywell have established a fair base in the market6. In India, we will see very soon RFID intervention being  used extensively. Neighborhood post offices using RFID  to  track  lost  parcels,  Indian  farmers  keeping  a  tab  on  their  cattle  using  RFID,  these  are  two  small  examples  of massive RFID deployment. Other applications include  legal  firms  turning  to  RFID  for  tracking  or  automating  files, airlines use the technology to track the location of  luggage trolleys, construction companies using RFID tags  inserted  to  concrete  blocks  for  instant  dissemination  of  results over the internet. With this objective, the ambitious  ‘National  RFID  Program’  project  was  initiated  in April,  2007. The program is being implemented jointly by IIT,  Kanpur,  C-DAC,  Noida  and  SAMEER,  Mumbai7. 
In India, the usage of RFID technology is growing at  a considerable pace. Industries such as retail, healthcare,  automotive,  supply  chain  and  public  transit  are  opening  up opportunities for the industry players.  ‘Chitale’, one  of  the  prominent  dairy  producers  in  Pune  has  deployed  the  RFID  chips  in  cattle  for  the  collection  of  feeding  data,  breeding  data  and  also  to  keep  a  record  of  the  animals8.

and  its  applications.  Among  such  studies,  Chao,  Yang  &  Jen9   used  bibliometric  techniques  to  examine  RFID  topic  in  SCI  journals  from  1991  through  November   2005.  A  historical  review  method  was  used  to  analyse  RFID innovation, adoption by organisations, and market  diffusion. From this analysis, supply chain management  (SCM),  health  industry,  and  privacy  issues  emerge  as  the  major  trends  in  RFID.  Also,  the  contributions  of  the  RFID  industry  and  forecasts  of  technological  trends  were  also  analysed,  concluding  that  RFID  will  be  more  ubiquitously  diffused  and  assimilated  into  our  daily  lives in the near future. Irani, Gunasekaran & Dwivedi10  analysed the distribution/trends of RFID research across  subject  category,  source  titles,  geographical  locations,  document types and year of publications. It also identified  frequently  published  authors  and  productive  institutions  for  conducting  RFID-related  research  and  explored  the  trend of topics/research issues and utilised methods and  synthesised  the  existing  research  to  develop  a  research  model/framework  that  reflects  current  status  and  trends  of RFID research. Nagaia11, et al., presented a review of  literature  on  RFID,  by  reviewing  85  academic  journal  papers  that  were  published  on  the  subject  between  1995  and  2005.  The  analysis  is  focused  on  four  main  categories: Technological issues, applications areas, policy  and  security  issues,  and  other  issues.  
3.  ObjectIveS 
The  main  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  study  the  performance  of  India’s  research  on  RFID  during  2006- 15,  based  on  publications  output,  as  indexed  in  Scopus  database.  In  particular,  the  objectives  of  the  study  are  to  study  the  : 
(a) Growth  of  Indian  literature  and  its  distribution  by  
type  of  documents  and  publications  sources  and  
citation  impact; 
(b) Contribution,  global  share  and  citation  impact  of  
top  10  most  productive  countries; 
(c) Distribution  of  Indian  research  output  by  broad  
subject areas; and identification of application areas  
in  India; 
(d) Publication productivity and citation impact of most  
productive  organisations  and  authors;  
(e) Leading medium of communication and characteristics  
of  highly  cited  papers  
4.  MethODOLOGy 
The study retrieved and downloaded the publication  data  of  the  world  and  of  15  most  productive  countries  on  RFID  from  the  Scopus  database  during  2006-15.  The  keyword  ‘RFID’  was  used  in  ‘title’,  abstract  and  keyword”  search  tag  and  restricted  it  to  the  period  2006-15  in  ‘date  range’  search  tag  for  searching  global  publication data. This was used as the main search string  as  shown  below.  Further,  the  main  search  string  was  restricted to 10 most productive countries one by one in

downward  trend  in  India’s  collaboration  in  research  over  time.  Its  share  of  collaborative  papers  declined  by  5.09  %;  down  from  13.53  %  in  2006-10  to  8.44  %  share  of  total  country  output  in  2011-15  (Table  1).  This  downward  trend  in  international  collaboration  in  research  could  be  attributed  to  decline  in  collaborative  research activitywith U.K. (20.96 %), France (13.04 %),  Australia and Singapore (12.26 % each) and USA (4.01 %)  between 2006-10 and 2011-15. Nevertheless, collaborative  research activity witnessed rise with partners in Sweden  (12.82 %), followed by Saudi Arabia (10.26 %), Finland  and  Iran  (5.91  %)  and  China  (0.78  %)  during  2006-10  to  2011-15  (Table  2).

India is ranked13th   top  country  in  the  world  for  its  global publication share (2.58 %) in RFID research during  2006-15.India  showed  faster  growth  (20.69  %  CAGR)  compared  to  the  world  (-0.42  %.,  CAGR).However,  India’s performance in terms of quality of its publication  output was not as significant. Itscitation impact in RFID  research  was  comparatively  low,just  1.32  citations  per  paper. India’s collaboration in RFID research with USA

The  country output in terms of its international collaborative  papers  was  low,  accounting  for  just  9.81  %  share.  Computer  science  accounted  for  the  largest  publication  share (57.44 %) in India’s total output on RFID research  during  2006-15,  followed  engineering  (49.21  %),  social  sciences (7.28 %), mathematics (6.01 %), materials science  (5.85 %), business, management & accounting (5.54 %)  and physics & astronomy (4.75 %) during 2006-15. The  publication  activity  of  India  witnessed  rising  trend  in  engineering, materials science and physics & astronomy,  as  against  declining  trend  in  computer  science,  social  sciences,  mathematics  and  business,  management  &  accounting  from  2006-10  to  2011-15.

productive  organisations  in  RFID  research  in  India  together  contributed  35.60  %  publications  share  and  38.18  %  citation  share  during  2006-15.The  top  15  most  productive  authors  in  RFID  research  in  India  together  accounted  for  19.15  %  publications  share  and  36.73  %  citation share during 2006-15. The top 15 most productive  journals  together  accounted  for  47.44  %  share  of  total  country  output  in  RFID  research  during  2006-15. 
India’s performance in RFID research is not encouraging  both  in  terms  of  quantity  and  quality  of  publications.  No  wonder  that  India  is  ranked  at  13th   position  in  the  world  in  RFID  research.  India’s  publications  output  on  RFID  research  is  scattered  widelyacross  journals  and  that  this  trend  seems  to  be  one  of  the  reasons  for  its  low  citation  impact.
