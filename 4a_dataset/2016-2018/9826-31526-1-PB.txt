1.  InTRodUCTIon 
Medicine is a field where the practice of health-care  evolved  to  maintain  prevention  and  treatment  carried  out  in  human  beings.  Current  medical  education  aims  at  understanding  the  crucial  role  of  doctors  in  society,  the  need  for  continuing  education  and  health  care.  Clinical information needs are important because faculty  and  students  engage  in  clinical  practice  need  specific  and  recent  information  for  the  patient  care.  Library  professionals  serving  in  medical  institutions  require  thought understanding about the varied factors and forces  influencing  such  services  and  the  best  way  to  deal  the  clinical  information  needs  of  the  medical  students.  
The  concept  of  health  is  no  longer  limited  to  the  absence  of  disease,  today  it  encompasses  the  physical,  mental and social wellbeing of each individual. Significant  changes  in  health  care  knowledge  and  need  for  clinical  information  at  the  point  of  care  have  changing  practice  of library services. The library activities from selection of  materials to their directed use emphasised those aspects  which are remedial and therapeutic, faculty and students  of health-care institution should be encouraged to use the  library collection for their clinical information needs. The  revolutionary changes in information and communication  technologies  changed  the  way  of  information  is  stored,  retrieved  and  disseminated,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  libraries  to  satisfy  clinical  information  needs  so  they  are  timely  and  accurate  in  nature.  
The  availability  of  clinical  information  on  the  web  has  changed  the  way  of  information  searching  in  recent  
years.  Information  needs  and  use  by  medical  students  for  clinical  practice  has  continued  to  be  a  hot  topic  of  research  in  recent  years.  Services  provided  by  health  science university libraries depends not only on funding,  whether received form one or more levels of government  or form private sources, but also on the competence and  commitment  to  the  concept  of  optimum  utilisation  of  web-based  clinical  information  resources  and  services.  Medical  library  professional  due  to  cost  constraint  and  support by the management are facing problems to balance  on  cost  effectiveness  and  fulfil  the  needs  of  students.  Library professionals have to develop a suitable discovery  tool for search, retrieved and delivery of information, by  which they can evaluate the impact and develop suitable  models  for  clinical  information  delivery. 
Nowadays, there are various online sources available  library  professional  has  to  take  a  step  towards  so  that  the student should be encouraged to take up to enhance  his/her  knowledge  as  medicine  as  a  branch  demands  exhaustive  dedication  and  continuous  learning.  The  present study aimed to determine the extent use of library  for  clinical  information  needs  among  the  students  of  health  science  universities  in  Karnataka  and  discussed  about  various  types  of  clinical  information  resources  and  services  provided  to  deliver  clinical  information  to  medical  students.

practice for the patient care provided to physician/medical  practitioners.  Clinical Information Resources is a platform  for  faculty  and  students  to  access  many  Online  Clinical  Databases  like  e-books,  e-journals  and  other  electronic  information  resources  and  services.  The  information  needs of medical profession rise form variety of factors  such  as  patient  care,  continuing  medical  education  and  other  research  activities.  Clinical  information  needs  are  different  compared  to  general  research  and  education  because  medical  profession  required  quick  and  upto  date practical information that can be applied in patient  care. Marshall1 explained that clinical information needs  includes,  what  information  are  perceived,  what  are  the  channels  used  and  what  are  the  information  is  applied   for  patient  care.  Williams2 categorised  the  information  needs  of  medical  practitioners  based  on  the  following  factors,  i.e.,  existing  knowledge,  solving  new  problem,  update knowledge through review, obtain another speciality  when  treating  with  a  patient,  find  out  rare  patient  care  problem  and  assist  to  implement  new  organisational  programs. 
The  assessment  of  web-based  technologies  enabled  
participation in clinical rounds as a part of clinical care  group and proper training required for clinical librarians  to  support  clinical  care.  
Padmamma8, et al.,  evaluated the library resources and  services at JJM medical college, Davanagere, Karnataka.  Study  found  that  majority  of  the  students  visit  library  to refer books and journals and majority of the students  were  satisfied  with  physical  facilities  provided  by  the  library. Winning & Beverley9 found that the information  provided  by  clinical  librarian  are  cost  effective  and  the  information  resources  are  effective  in  patient  care,  also  health  care  professionals  have  high  opinion  library  services  provided  by  clinical  librarian.  Kannappanavar  &  Rajanikanta10 studied  the  use  of  e-learning  resources  in  medical  colleges  at  Karnataka.  Researchers  found  that  majority  of  the  colleges  have  major  collection  of  e-databases, most of the colleges have consortia membership  and to the infrastructural facilities in almost all colleges  are good. Nwezh11 conducted study on health information  seeking behavior among Iran physicians including medical  students and residents. Study found that after introducing  digital  library  physicians  identified  and  used  what  they  
medical libraries to access large volume of health related  needed  are  relevant  reliable  information.  Providing  information in digital formats like textbooks, case-records,  good  infrastructural  accomplishment  can  represent  the  
clinical trials, protocols, critical reports, medical audio- video  images,  etc.  Accessing  medical  information  has  always been an important but challenging process for the  students  as  they  get  engaged  with  research  and  clinical  practice.  Health  practitioners  need  to  be  upto  date  with  new discoveries in health care practice. Libraries nowaday  due to technological advances have shifted from tradition  
best  utilisation  of  resources  and  services  at  the  library.  Ratnakar12, et al.,reviewed the role of consortia initiated  by  Indian  Council  of  Medical  Research  (ICMR)  in  promoting  medical  resources  among  25  medical  college  libraries,  the  author  highlights  on  financial  delinquent,  resource  sharing  and  other  benefits  of  consortia.  
Lasserre13, et al., in the study presented the findings  
to hybrid environment and devote increased attention for  
of  a  survey  on  medical  students  in  Australia  about  the  providing access to print and electronic resources. Clinical  
usefulness of the rural medicine rotation (RMR) personal  
information resources provides clinicians with access to  print and electronic resources of health knowledge such  as Medical Information, Micromedex, BMJ Best Practice,  Dyna  Med,  MD  Consult,  Embase,  Medline,  PsychInfo,  ProQuest, Ovid SP, PubMed, Web of Science, Psychiatry  Online,  Clinical  Guidelines,   etc. 
2. LITeRATURe  RevIew 
In one of the earliest studies on clinical information  needs  Mayada3   pointed  out  that  clinicians’  information  searches focuses on diseases/treatments and these information  in different form are comparted to teachers and researchers.  Woodsworth  &  Neufeld4   in  a  study  of  physicians  self- education  patterns  conducted  at  Toronto  expressed  that  most of  the medical students and residents depend up on  textbooks and medical journals for information gathering.  Friedlander5 stated that clinicians information use pattern  is  differ  compared  to  scientists  and  researchers.  King6  studied  on  information  services  at  hospital  libraries  on  patient care reports of 176 nurses, physicians, and other  health  professionals  in  8 chicago,  study  showed  that  
digital assistants (PDA) service, author recommends that  there  is  significant  need  to  support  services  to  access  clinical information on PDA to medical students in rural  areas. John & Gandhi14   stated  that  medical  scholars  are  increasingly  dependent  on  electronic  databases  to  find  information,  researchers  found  that  database  for  the  requirement  of  medical  information  is  the  best  strategy,  which  depends  on  awareness  of  the  users  about  the  databases. Thanuskodi15 stated  that  emergence  of  digital  information has replaced the paper based records, medical  libraries has moved towards digital information for effective  information delivery. Wilson16, et al.,explored the extent  or use of e-books for the needs of medical academics in  the  university  of  New  South  Wales,  in  performance  of  academic tasks. Data reveals that medical academics are  increasingly  enthusitic  while  access  is  e-books  through  mobile environments. Rao17 in a study clinician’s awareness  towards evidence-based medicine (EBM) resources provide  practical  knowledge  of  physicians. After  evaluating  the  study it is revealed that UpToDate, PubMed/Medline and  MD consult  are most preferred sources to obtain evidence  
majority of the respondents showed high rating on library  based  medicine.  Dee  &  Stanley18 enlightened  the  use  
performance. Giuse7,  et al ., examined the training skills  for clinical librarians to support effective library services.  Researchers explain that clinical medical librarians require  
126 
of  health  resources  and  libraries  by  clinical  nurses  and  nursing students, findings reveals that clinical nurses and  nursing  students  were  likely  to  depend  upon  colleagues

The  Karnataka  state  has  many  well  recognised  Health  Science  Universities/Deemed  Universities  to  be  among the top medical universities in India. The aim of  the  study  is  to  determine  the  extents  use  of  library  and  information  for  clinical  information  among  students  of  Health  Science  Universities  in  Karnataka  State.  Health  care professionals face several problems like information  on  clinical  practice  is  not  distributed,  contents  are  distributed  with  various  sources,  difficult  to  search  and  difficult  to  retrieve.  Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  find: 
a. How the students prefer to get information from the  
library  
b. What are Clinical Information Resources and Services  
available  in  the  library?  What  is  the  awareness  
among  the  students  of  Health  Science  Universities  
about available online clinical information resources  
and  services 
c. What  is  the  role  of  library  while  providing  the  
clinical  information. 
For better understanding about the clinical information  needs of students and the method accessing information  from  the  various  sources  by  which  they  locate  the  information the present study is focused on these issues  specific to the use pattern of library by Medical students  from  health  science  universities  in  Karnataka.

8. ReCoMMendATIonS 
Addressing  the  attitude  towards  the  use  of  library  resources  and  services  for  clinical  information  needs  researcher recommends following suggestions to improve  the  services  provided  by  Medical  Universities/deemed  universities. To achieve the effective clinical information  delivery medical library profession regularly analyse the  ICT  Infrastructure.  The  adoption  of  ICT  should  not  be  considered  as  a  luxury,  but  as  an  added  tool  to  provide  the current information effectively to fulfil the complex  needs  of  the  user.  It  is  recommended  that  the  Medical  Libraries  should  be  equipped  with  advance  collection  of electronic resources and digital library facilities  and  it  is  recommended  that  data  access  speed  (Networking  Infrastructure) should be increased. To solve cost constraints,  financial crunch among medical colleges effective consortia  framework model should be developed. There is need for  Web scale discovery tools, semantic web technologies to  
of  the  time’  they  use  clinical  guidelines  sites (d) E-journals  and  e-books  are  the  most  used  sources  
to get required information 27.57% of  respondents  
‘Always’ uses e-journals and 28.92% respondents stated  
that  ‘Most  of  the  time’  they  referred  E-books (e) Majority  of  students  felt  Web-based  information  
resources  are  substitute  for  library 
(f) Medical  students  obtain  clinical  information  from  
various  clinical  databases  like  Access  Medicine ,  
BMJ,  Embase ,  MD Consult ,  Scopus ,  UpToDate   and  
other  database. 
databases, & 34.46% of  respondents expressed ‘Most  
effectives  retrieve  clinical  information  resources.  There  
is  need  for  accurate  and  relevant  clinical  information  
7.5 Satisfaction  Towards  Clinical  Information  
Resources  and  Services. 
(a) Compared to print to electronic considering the factor  
including  such  as  time,  coverage,  cost,  flexibility,  
and effectiveness respondents are more comfortable  
with  electronic  compared  to  print  
(b) 32.16%  of  respondents  felt  that  web-based  clinical  
Information  resources  are  substitute  to  library (c) 81.35%  of  respondents  said  they  were  aware  about  
Training/orientation class,  followed  by  72.84%  of  
respondents  are  aware  about  database  searching,  
66.89%  of  respondents  are  aware  about  internet- 
based  information  resources  and  services  provided  
by  the  library 
(d) 72.74%  of  respondents  are  aware  about  library  
oPAc,  72.84%  of  respondents  aware  about  Digital  
Library  Services  provided  by  the  library (e) 84.05%  of  respondents  said  they  are  satisfied  with  
the  existing  library  collection  and  service 
delivery  for  medical  students  required  so  need  based  resources has to improve at the time of subscription. For  effective information retrieval provision should be made  with adequate training on information searching skill to  medical library staff and students. Library professionals  have  to  promote  existing  services  popularising  using  extension  activities  and  social  networking  applications  better  utilisation  of  library  services. 
9. ConCLUSIonS 
Medical librarian’s involvement in patient care plays  and  an  important  role  in  clinical  care  and  the  medical  library  professional  should  be  trained  in  manner  which  facilitates  to  be  more  aware  about  better  contribution  and  access  to  clinical  information  delivery.  This  study  indicates the attitude towards the use of library for clinical  information  needs  formten  medical  university/deemed  universities  in  Karnataka.  The  response  to  the  survey  showed  medical  students  are  well  aware  with  existing  clinical  information  resources  available  in  the  library.  Despite  the  perceived  benefits  of  e-resource  related  to  clinical  information  resources  there  are  some  barriers  like  lack  of  infrastructure,  lack  of  network  facility  and  lack of training are the major barriers to access required  information.  However,  it  does  appear  that  the  clinical  sources are valuable asset to clinical practices for medical  students and proactive steps should be taken to overcome  the  existing  problem  at  the  health  university  libraries.  Also there is a need for radical changes and innovations  in the structure and process of clinical information at all  levels to cope with the explosion in medical knowledge  in the changing conditions in the health care information  delivery  system.
