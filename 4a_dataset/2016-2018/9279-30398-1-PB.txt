The  present  century  has  been  earmarked  by  various  revolutionary  and  innovative  developments  such  as  information revolution, recent electronic technology revolution, globalisation and privatisation. The application of  ICT in libraries has resulted in redefning the housekeeping operations like digitalisation, preservation, indexing,  distribution, authenticating, etc. On the other hand the librarian has to face the challenges in managing the digital  resources. The special libraries are the libraries concerned almost exclusively with literature of a particular subject  or special collection and to a special user. The Special libraries exist to serve the needs of the personnel of a parent  organisation. All India Radio Media Libraries. The attempt has been made to know the management of digital  resources and the strategies followed in selected All India Radio Libraries in Karnataka. The questionnaire and the  
interview method were used for the study.

1.  INtRODUctION 
All  India  Radio(AIR)  is  the  mother  of  all  radio  stations. AIR aims to provide information, education, and  entertainment.  The  true  initiation  of  radio  broadcasting  in India has started on a trial basis in 1921 when Times  of India in alliance with Post and Telegraph Department  broadcasted  an  audio  programme.  AIR  currently  has  a  network  of  223  broadcasting  centers  with  143  average  frequency  (MW),  54  high  frequency  (SW)  and  161  FM  transmitters. It encompasses an area of 91.42 % serving  99.13  %,  of  the  population  of  India.  AIR  covers  24  languages  and  146  dialects  in  home  services.  In  the  beginning, AIR libraries did not face any problems due to  less collection of information resources. Later it become  difficult to manage the collection in the libraries without  library  professional  and  library  systems.  
With the application of ICT on media production and  delivery technology AIR-related information resources are  now in born digital form and are available through network  communication. All the information assets are collected and  indexed. Academic libraries maintain traditional resources  and are now shifting towards digitisation to establish digital  library, but media libraries like newspapers, telecast and  AIR  already  have  information  resources  in  born  digital  form. Digital resources is becoming popular due to their  ease  of  use,  mobility  (accessible  through  hand-held  mobile  devices),  sharing  the  same  information  resource  among number of users, unlimited accessibility, and one  time investment. The implementation of new technology,  
planning  and  policies,  monitoring,  decision  making,  expert  staffing,  data  security,  information  distribution,  etc.,  issues  need  a  systematic  unique  professional  task  to manage digital libraries and are often called as digital  resources  management  strategies. 
2.  LItERAtURE  REVIEW 
Wactlar & Christel1  in their study explored the need  of  metadata  increases  with  the  growth  of  digital  audio  visual  archives.  They  suggested  automatic  analysis  of  video  in  support  of  content-based  retrieval  which  will  be the necessary step in managing the archive. Fenner2 pointed  out  that  it  is  becoming  common  for  librarians  to  consider  availability  of  open  access  web  resources  as  components  of  a  collection,  whether  the  resources  are  catalogued  and  appears  in  the  Web  OPAC,  or  are  accessible through links on a library web page. Attention  in being paid towards digitising materials and publishing  digital collections on the World Wide Web as a strategy  to  increase  user  access.  
Chadha3  explained various digital preservation strategies  and techniques refreshing, replication, technology preservation,  backwards compatibility and version migration, medium  to long-term preservation strategies, migration, emulation,  investment  strategies,  encapsulation,  etc. 
Carl4, et al.,   exposed  the  challenges  for  preserving  audio  and  video  records.  The  characteristic  attributes  of  preserving  video  and  audio  documents  are  relatively  few formats (for video records, the phonograms archive

2.1 All  India  Radio  Scenario  of  India 
 The establishment of radio broadcasting in India has  
2.2 AIR  Scenario  of  Karnataka 
In  1935,  private  radio  station  started  in  Mysore,  Karnataka,  early  1990s  saw  the  dawn  of  commercial  television in India. In 1936, M.V. Gopalswamy of Mysore  named  Akashvani  where  he  set  up  the  nation’s  first  private radio station in his home, ‘Vittal Vihar’. The name  Akashvani  indicates  celestial  announcement.  The  word,  of  Sanskrit  origin,  is  often  found  in  Hindu  mythology.  Literally,  ‘akash’  means  ‘sky’  and  vani  implies  ‘voice’  
India in association with Post and Telegraph Department  broadcasts  a  musical  programme.  Sir  George  Lloyd  put  forward  this  request  to  the  related  companies.  In    1927  private radio clubs proliferated. Radio broadcasting was  started under the Indian broadcasting Company in 1930.  However, the Company went into liquidation after a span  of three years and the Government established the control  
started on an experimental basis in 1921 when Times of  
or  ‘message’.  Thus,  Akashvani  seemed  suitable  for  a  
radio  broadcaster  and  was  later  adopted  by  the  AIR  
after  independence8. 
At  a  time  when  private  FM  channels  are  giving  a  tough  competition,  the  assured  listenership  of  AIR  has  reached  up  to  a  million  at  any  given  point  of  time  in  Karnataka,  and  for  special  broadcasts  this  number  can  even  be  four  times  higher.  According  to  the  latest  
of  broadcasting  at  their  own  expenditure.  The  creation  survey  by  Akashvani’s  Audience  Research  Unit  (ARU)  
of separate office for the Controller of broadcasting was  established  during  March  1935.  The  year  1936  is  the  milestone in the Indian broadcasting which changed the  name from Indian broadcasting to All India Radio (AIR).  In the same year Delhi station was formed6   Keeping  in  view  the  slogan,  ‘bahujan  Hitaya;  bahujan  Sukhaya’,  i.e.,  the  benefit  and  happiness  of  huge  segment  of  the  people, AIR  aims  to  provide  information,  education  for  rural development and entertainment. The following are  the  objectives  of AIR:  
1.  Preserve  the  country's  unity  and  the  self-governing  
values  as  shrined  in  the  Constitution.  
2.  Present  a  reasonable  and  distributed  flow  of  data  
of national, regional, local and International related  
news and matters including contrastive views. Citation  
of  any  opinion  or  philosophy  of  its  own  should  be  
avoided. Integrity of the country should be respected.  
Various  programmes  in  broadcasting  should  be  
integrated.  
3.  Develop programmes which can arouse, communicate,  
in  bengaluru  it  is  revealed  that  almost  one  million  of  figure achieved in 2014-15 is 30 % which is higher than  the  assured  listenership  reported  in  2013-14. Also ARU  figures  reveals  that,  the  last  six  months  have  magically  brought  in  a  30  %  increase  in  audience  data  compared  to  2013-14  that  showed  ‘7  lakh  people  tuning  in  at  any  given  point  of  time.’  The  Karnataka  state AIR  has  also  reported  a  profit  of  Rs.  10.4  crore  during  2014-15,  up  from  Rs.  6.5  crore  in  2013-149. 
The  Transcript  Service  of  various  languages  was  started  on  3  April  1954  and  entrusted  with  the  main  function  of  preparing  transcription  of  speeches  of  all  dignitaries  with  special  focus  on  the  Prime  Ministers  and  Presidents  of  the  country.  
AIR  office  has  the  following  functional  units: (a)  Central Archives 
(b)  Programme  Exchange  Unit 
(c) Transcription  Unit 
(d)  Refurbishing  Unit  
to  satisfy  all  the  audiences  throughout  the  nation.  4.  Formulate  different  programmes  for  broadcasting,  
keeping  in  mind  to  reach  all  sections  of  people  of  
the  nation.  
5.  Prepare  progressive  and  reference  programmes  on  
different  fields  like  Education,  Agriculture,  Health  
and family Welfare, Science and Technology trends,  
explain,  train,  educate,  and  entertain  and  improve

(f)  Commercial  Release  &  Marketing 
A special project was launched to convert analogues  recordings  in  to  digitise  form  of  all  archival  recordings  in  2001.  Now,  Akashvani  has  become  one  of  the  most  important  digital  libraries  in  the  broadcasting  network  with  recent  tape  numbering  system  in  tune  with  the  internationally  accepted  norms.10

SAROJADEVI, PADMAMMA  & W ALMIKI: DIGITAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES 
Tape media library is a special kind of library with  respect  to  its  collection  and  access  type  of  information  resources.  Library  information  resources  are  restricted  to  internal  users  only.  The  library  professional  and  technical  staff  extracts  day  to  day  information  for  long  term  preservation.  Digitisation  of  AIR  audio  recording  has  also  started  to  a  great  extent,  correspondingly  the  archival  volume  will  also  increase.  
2.3 DIGItAL  RESOURcE  MANAGEMENt 
StRAtEGIES 
Generally  media  organisations  are  shifting  towards  digital resources so the users working are also depending  on digital resources. Most of the media library organisations  are  producing  born-digital  information  resources.  but  e-books, e-journals, e-databases are not much helpful to  media  library  patrons.  Space,  financial  constraints,  ease  of  preservation  and  management  of  digital  resources.  Advancement  of  ICT  is  witness  for  establishment  of  digital collection and management. Generally AIR library  usually contains audio clippings of different programs of  music,  artists  recorded  on  tapes  and  DVDs  in  digitised  form.  Digital  resources  becoming  popular  due  to  their  ease  of  use,  mobility,  sharing  the  same  information  resource  among  number  of  users,  unlimited,  anywhere  and everywhere accessibility, low budgeted and one time  investment  and  management  can  be  done  in  less  time.  It  facilitates  globalised  reach  and  multiple  users  can  simultaneously access of digital resources. Hence for the  successful  digital  library  establishment,  it  is  necessary  to  manage  the  digital  resources  in  a  systematic  and  well  organised  manner.11   The  successful  digital  library  establishment  requires  good  library  management  and  administration.  So  question  arise  why  the  management  of digital resources? What are the policies? How the HR  policies differ from traditional library? How management  strategies  provide  the  mass  media  library  to  serve  in  a  better  way  with  professional  passion?  The  points  necessitate  the  need  of  digital  resources  management  strategies  are  as  follows: 
(a) Users’  service  through  greater  access  to  accurate  
digital  information  sources. 
(b) Enhanced  information  resources  and  knowledge  
satisfaction  among  users. 
(c) More  economical  and  safer  means  of  storing  and  
keeping  track  of  digital  information  resources. (d) Easier  access  to  digital  information  resources  like  
old  reports,  e-journals,  e-books,  online  databases  
and  even  audio  visual  materials,  etc. 
(e) Reduces  errors  and  eliminating  the  ennui  of  long  
and  repetitive  manual  processing. 
(f) Greater  liability  and  lucidity  in  operations  by  
monitoring. 
(g) Improved efficiency and effectiveness in administration  
and  management  of  digital  resources  as  it  has  
unprecedented  access  to  real-time  information. (h) More  consistent  safety  for  susceptible  and  secret  
information. 
(i) Appropriate knowledge-based action and intervention  
can  now  take  place  in  a  timelier  manner. (j) L i b r a r y   n e t w o r k i n g   t h r o u g h   w e b - b a s e d  
architecture. 
Hence,  digital  resource  collection  and  management  is  a  systematic  and  organised  approach  that  allows  the  management  of  digital  resource  to  focus  on  achievable  objectives  and  to  attain  the  best  possible  results  to  increase  the  organisational  digital  library  performance  to  achieve  organisation  goal.  Management  by  Objective  is  outlined  by  Peter  Drucker  in  his  book  ‘The  Practice  Management’  it  is  about  setting  yourself  objectives  and  then  break  these  down  in  to  more  specific  goals  or  key  results.12 
  The  word  strategy  has  entered  in  the  field  of  management more recently. At first the world was used in  the terms of Military science to mean what a manager does  to offset or potential actions of competitors. Originally the  word strategy has been derived from Greek “Strategies”  which  means  ‘general’.  The  word  strategy,  therefore,  means  the  art  of  the  general.  When  the  term  strategy  is  used  in  military  sense  it  refers  to  actions  that  can  be  taken  in  the  light  of  action  taken  by  opposite  party.13 
So,  digital  resource  management  strategies  may  be  considered as library managerial level or top level library  management  that  makes  a  framework  for  digital  library  and policies about how to establish, collect, implement,  optimise, organise and manage the digital resources with  the help of operational level strategies or middle and low  level management to achieve excellency in organisational  goal  of  a  digital  library.  ‘DRM  activity  might  therefore  be called the ‘brains’ behind well managed digital library  services’. The Holy Grail of ERM is management of the  entire  lifecycle,  with  support  for  the  following  kinds  of  tasks: 
(a) Discovery  of  new  products 
(b) Product  evaluation  and  comparisons 
(c) License  negotiations 
(d) Ordering  and  renewal 
(e) Tracking  license  terms 
(f) Point  of  use  information  about  license  terms  and  
technical  support 
(g) Creation  of  web  gateways 
(h) Individual title access through catalogues, searchable  
title  lists  and  link  resolves 
(i) Overlap  analysis  of  database  products 
(j) Usage  analysis 
(k) Access  management 
(l) Proxy  services.

3.  ObJEctIVES 
The objectives of the study are to know the present  status  of  the  media  libraries  and  their  information  and  communication technology infrastructure. The paper also   highlights  the  organisation  of  information  resources;  preservation and management of digital resources and the  policies being followed for preservation and management  of digital resources because these media libraries, are the  archival  centers  which  fosters  the  culture  and  heritage  of  our  nation.  
4.  MEtHODOLOGY 
The study covers all six AIR libraries (AIR Dharwad,  Madikeri, Mangalore, bengaluru,Vijaypur, Udupi). Survey  method and structured questionnaire (as a data collection  tool)  were  used  for  the  selected  libraries  under  study.  All the AIR libraries were visited. Udupi (brahmavaram)  and Vijaypur (bijapur) are relay stations where there are  no  library  and  library  professionals.

5.7  Digital preservation 
Digital  preservation  policies  are  very  important  for  effective  and  efficient  management  of  digital  resources.
