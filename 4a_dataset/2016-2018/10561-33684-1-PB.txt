1.  IntroductIon 
A  significant  percentage  of  web  users  are  using  social  networks.  During  last  ten  years,  a  new  paradigm  of  internet  communication  has  been  created  that  is  called  Social  media.  This  kind  of  media  has  facilitated  interaction among users and consequently there is a new  platform for collaboration. In web-based social networks,  users  can  share  together  public  or  special  information.  Social  networks  such  as  Facebook,  Twitter,  and  special  networks such as Linkedin, Mendeley, and ResearchGate are  accessible  to  public.  Social  networks  offer  various  capabilities for scholars to do research activities. Creating  a  virtual  scientific  ring  of  scholars  facilitate  academic  communication among them1. Academics need to express  their intentions in terms of how, when, and what shows  up  when  somebody  makes  use  of  a  search  engine  for  searching their name or area of research. Building a web  presence  can  make  a  difference  for  our  visibility  to  a  desired audience and create opportunities for new projects  and  collaborations2.  Therefore,  current  research  intends  to  survey  participation  of  Iranian  faculty  members  of  the  Library  and  Information  Science  departments  using  ResearchGate   as  academic  Social  network.

Collaboration  of  the  researchers  at  national  and  international  level  is  seen  as  an  important  contribution  to  the  science.  Some  papers  are  related  to  the  scientific  collaboration.  For  example,  Han3   found  that  most  of

Chinese academic librarians use web 2.0 tools at primary  level  in  their  services.  
Asnafi4,  et  al.   indicated  that  most  of  the  scholars  of  the  three  and  main  important  universities  in Ahvaz  -  Ahvaz JundiShapur, Shahid Chamran and Islamic Azad are  active in ResearchGate  and share their works with others  scholars.  Furthermore,  they  also  revealed  that  scholars  of  Ahvaz  Azad  University,  Science  and  Research  Unit,  had  the  highest  presence  and  action  on  ResearchGate.  Scholars need to adapt themselves to the new technologies  and  information  ground.  Establishing  some  workshops  for  scholars  and  faculty  members  in  order  to  become  familiar  with  academic  social  networks  and  their  usage  can  increase  their  scientific  status.  In  the  recent  years,  scholars  are  using  new  tools  for  research  and  scientific  collaboration.  In  fact,  since  Web  2.0  has  been  raised,  process  of  scientific  interactions  has  been  facilitated.  Mendeley,  ResearchGate ,  Academia  and others are online  tools for creating professional networks. They are developed  as a social networking site for scholars around the world.  
Mohammadi  &  Thellwall5   found  that  Mendeley readership data could be used to help to capture knowledge  transfer across scientific disciplines, especially for people  who  read,  but  do  not  author  articles,  as  well  as  giving  impact evidence at an earlier stage than that is possible  with citation counts. MacMillan6  indicated that Mendeley  enables  higher  level  information  literacy  by  helping  users  focus  on  locating  and  organising  information  and  spend  less  time  on  citation  details.  Mendeley's  social

networking features are compatible with emerging work  practices,  facilitating  collaboration  among  researchers  through group's functions and open sharing of information  through  groups  and  publication  lists. 
Madhusudhan7   explored  how  research  scholars  of  University  of  Delhi  integrated  Social  Networking  Sites  (SNS) into their daily communication for research work.  Findings  indicated  that  additionally,  most  respondents  preferred  the  SNS  Facebook   and  ResearchGate   for  academic purposes. Collaborative and peer-to-peer learning  were common benefits from SNSs while others expressed  concern  regarding  cyber-bullying  and  privacy.  Finally,  a  majority  of  respondents  said  using  SNSs’  is  a  waste  of  time. 
Sarrafzadeh8,  et  al .  investigated  on  the  status  of  Web  2.0  in  Iran's  LIS  education.  They  found  that  LIS  academics  in  Iran  had  a  good  level  of  familiarity  with  some  Web  2.0  tools  such  as  blog,  Wiki,  YouTube   and  Facebook.  However,  their  familiarity  with  some  other  Web 2.0 tools such as RSS feeds,  Twitter ,  Flickr ,  Delicious,  and Podcast was limited. Blogs, Discussion groups, Chat  tools, File sharing tools, Wikis  and SMS,  Video  sharing  tools  and Forum were used respectively by LIS academics  in their teaching. Internet filtering was identified as the  most inhibiting barrier to the use of Web 2.0 tools. Lack  of  access  to  high  speed  internet  and  lack  of  training  were the other identified barriers. The authors suggested  that  to  reap  the  benefits  of  Web  2.0,  LIS  academics  need  to  find  alternative  non  filtered  Web  2.0  tools  to  employ  in  their  teaching  and  research.  The  importance  of collaborations across geographical, institutional and/ or disciplinary boundaries has been widely recognised in  research communities, yet there exist a range of obstacles  to  such  collaborations.The  importance  of  collaborations  across  geographical,  institutional  and/or  disciplinary  boundaries  has  been  widely  recognised  in  research  communities, yet there exist a range of obstacles to such  collaborations.  In  a  study,  Sun  Oh  &  Jeng9 found  that  online  social  networking,  especially  ASNS,  may  foster  multi-disciplinary collaborations by providing a platform  for  researchers  from  diverse  backgrounds  to  find  one  another  and  cooperate  on  issues  of  common  interests.  Study of Nicolas & Rowlands10 showed that social media  were used for collaborative authoring, conferencing, and  scheduling meetings. They reported that impact of these  media  existed  in  all  phases  of  research.  They  beleived  that social media have become important complementary  channels  for  disseminating  and  discovering  research.  Thellwall & Kousha11  stated that  ResearchGate  is a social  network  site  for  academics  to  create  their  own  profiles,  list  their  publications  and  interact  with  each  other.  It  provides  a  new  way  for  scholars  to  disseminate  their  publications and hence potentially changes the dynamics  of  informal  scholarly  communication.  ResearchGate view counts and download counts for individual articles  may also prove to be useful indicators of article impact  in  the  future.  Malal12   in  his  research  found  that  most  
260 
ResearchGate  members believe that in this social media  scholars  can  interact  together.  This  is  the  best  channel  for  knowldedge  sharing. 
Holmberg13   investigated  on  Online  attention  of  Universities in Finland. He suggested that ResearchGate score  from ResearchGate   and  Google  Trends   score  for  relative search volume correlate well with both productivity  of  the  universities  and  university  rankings,  some  of  the  other  social  media  sites  do  not  reflect  the  institutional  characteristics as well. The new social media metrics that  is called Altmetrics  can provide indicators for the societal  impact  of  research.  Presence  and  Visibility  of  scholars  can  be  measured  in  Social  media  using Altmetrics.

Jamali14   states  that  virtual  environments  that  are  Web  2.0  based,  increase  production  and  distribution  of  information. Academic and Scientific Social Media have  created  a  special  setting  for  international  collaboration.  Findings  indicated  that  36  Iranian  faculty  members  of  Library  and  Information  Science  Departments  from  14  Universities and Institutions are active on ResearchGate.  Current  research  study  revealed  that  the  Library  and  Information Science departments of Kharazmi University,  Islamic Azad University, Iran Medical Sciences University,  Islamic World Science Citation Center and Tehran University ̶ based on RG Score and Impact Points indicators   ̶  were  top Iranian active LIS departments in ResearchGate. Total  654 documents were shared in ResearchGate  by the Iranian  faculty  members  of  Library  and  Information  Science  departments. In ResearchGate  the articles, conference papers  and  books  had  the  most  representation  in  this  section.  H. Jamali and A.R. Noruzi have the best performance in  ResearchGate   based  on  indicators  such  as  Publications,  Citations and Reads. Present research article revealed that  most  of  the  Iranian  librarians,  academics  and  scholars  of  the  Library  and  Information  Science  are  not  aware  of academic social networks such as ResearchGate   and  they    do  not  use  these  networks.  Sarrafzadeh  &  Alavi 15 
  in  their  research  found  that  LIS  academics  in  Iran  had  good  level  of  familiarity  with  some  Web  2.0  tools  such  as  Blog,  Wiki, youTube  and Facebook.  However,  their  familiarity  with  some  other Web  2.0  tools  such  as  RSS,  feeds,  Twitter,  Flickr,  Delicious  and  podcast  was  limited. Blog, Discussion groups, Chattools, File sharing  tools, Wikis, SMS, Video sharing tools and Forum were  used  respectively  by  LIS  academics  in  their  teaching.  Online  Social  networking,  especially  SNS,  may  foster  multi-disciplinary collaborations by providing a platform  for  researchers  from  diverse  backgrounds  to  find  one  another  and  cooperate  on  issues  of  common  interests.  Using academic social networks information as a seeking  way for scholars has been changed. They are not limited  
262 
to  libraries,  educational  settings  and  search  engines.  It  seems  that  scientific  social  networks  have  changed  the  procedures of scholars. These networks have accelerated  the process of sharing knowledge. It should be noted that  in the new era of research and education, Science social  networking  websites  such  as  Academia,  ResearchGate,  and Mendeley  have essential role in the development of  education and research. Millions users around the world  use  these  networks  and  easily  can  access  their  needed  information.  They  are  not  limited  to  space  of  libraries  or search engines and their information seeking channels  have been changed. So scholars should adapt themselves  with  new  Information  context.  Interaction  of  Humanity  Sciences scholars with the web setting to do researchor to  communicate with other researchers can lead to emergence  of new ideas. Presence of Isfahan University of Medical  Sciences  researchers  in  the  scientific  social  network  adds  to  the  visibility  of  their  publications.  Finally,  it  is  suggested to study on the presence of Isfahan University  of Medical Sciences scholars in Google Scholar, Academia  and Mendeley.
