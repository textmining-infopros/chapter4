H-index has been widely used as one of the bibliometric measurement methods for researchers’ performance.  On the other hand, H-index has been unfair for fguring authors that have high number of citations but fewer  number of papers (perfectionist researcher) and researchers that have many papers but fewer citations (productive  researcher). The main objective of this article is to improve H-index for accommodating and calculating perfectionist  and  productive  researchers’  impact  based  on  Jain’s  Fairness  Index  algorithm  and  Lotka’s  Law.  For  improving  H-index by RA-index is proposed. To prove the proposed method, 1,710 citation data sets of top cited researchers  from Scopus based on author names list from Webometrics site are used. Fairness index of the RA-index has the  average of 91 per cent, which is higher than the fairness of H-Index 80 per cent has been found. 
Keywords: RA-index; H-index; Fairness-index; Jain fairness-index. 
1. IntRoductIon 
Researcher’s  impact  is  a  quantitative  representation  of  citation and number of paper of a researcher. The most well- known indices for researchers’ impact is called the H-Index. In  2005, Hirsch proposed the H-Index, an indicator to measure the  productivity of researchers, combining two parameter, i.e. the  number of papers and the number of citation1. Most indexing  services  such  as  Scopus,  Clarivate  Analysis,  and  Google  Scholar use the H-index to represent a researcher profle.  
On  the  other  hand,  from  the  literatures  we  found  weaknesses  in  the  implementation  of  the  H-index  is  found.  Bornmann1, stated that one of the weaknesses of the H-Index  is the diffculty for new researchers to get a citation. Secondly,  for senior researchers who have produced many publications,  although they no longer produce papers, their citations continue  to grow2. Mesiar3, stated that the H-Index was less sensitive to  researchers who have a large number of publications but with  fewer citations. Likewise, this is also the case with a researcher  that has a few publications with a high number of citation was  not  accommodated  by  H-index  calculation1,4,5. Two  type  of  researchers  who  are  not  well  accommodated  in  the  H-Index  method are the productive and perfectionist researcher types3,6,7.  The  excess  number  of  citations  and/or  number  of  papers  of  those  researchers  do  not  contribute  to  increase  the  H-index  value.  
H-index has widely been used i.e. to measure performance  of  researchers,  to  compare  scientifc  production,  also  to  be  implemented  in  organisational  level2,  although,  which  still  have the weaknesses on the calculation. Figure 1 shows  the

weakness  of  H-index  such  as,  H-index  is  not  sensitive  to  calculate the impact of productive researcher and perfectionist  researchers.  Moreover,  H-index  does  not  count  those  papers  that have never been cited1,8.  
To improve H-index, a scientrometrician named Egghe9 proposed  the  G-index.  G-index  accommodated  some  papers  with  high  citations’  number.  Bihui6, et  al.   stated  that  it  was  impossible  to  compare  researchers  that  belong  to  different  period  of  time  and  feld  of  study  and  proposed  the  R-index  to  complement  the  H-index.  Kosmulski,  in  2007  proposed  Maxprod  for  assessing  the  scientifc  output10.   Gangan 
11,   proposed  impact-Citation-Energy  (iCX)  as  an  alternative  bibliometric based on analogy in electricity energy. Abramo12,  stated  that  the  defnition  of  the  average  impact  cannot  be  claimed  as  a  researcher’s  performance.  He  proposed  some  methods called Mean Normalised Citation Score (MNCS) and  Fractional Scientifc Strength (FSS). Rodriguez13, proposed a  double rank for research assessment. For improving H-index,  some proposals have been submitted, but the H-index is still  used  as  the  most  popular  indexing  services.  This  condition  occurred because the correlation of the H-index and its variants,  etc. high, which is around 0.8-0.914. In literature, H-index has  some advantages, i.e. mathematically simple, it can be applied  to  any  level  of  aggregation,  it  combines  publications  and  citations, and its robust characteristic6.  
Wang15  described the area of the H-index as an h-core,  and the papers that have few citations as an h-tail area, while  Alonso13,  described  the  papers  that  have  high  citations  as  upper-tail.  Those  descriptions  are  used  for  identifying  areas  excluded  by  H-index  calculation.  H-index  value  excludes  the  upper-h-tail  and  lower-h-tail  in  calculating  the  h  value  of  a  researcher.  Egghe9   improved  the  calculation  method  of

G-index by including the upper-h-tail to calculate the  g  value  of a researcher. 
In this paper, four parts of areas in citation function of  researcher data set are as follows a) upper-h-tail, is an area that  the papers have higher citations than h-index value, b) h-core,  is an area of the number of h  papers that have  h  citation, c) lower-h-tail, is an area that the papers have lower citations than  h-index value, d) uncited-h-tail, is an area that the papers have  no citations. 
proposed a new method called RA-index that combines  all  the  tail-areas  of  the  citation  function,  including  uncited  papers  for  improving  the  sensitivity  of  H-index.  To  prove  RA-index calculation, 1,710 data set of citation from Scopus  were used. Our discrimination-index tool used discrimination  index, validation test and reliability test based on pearson and  Cronbach Alpha method. 
2. REsEARcH QuEstIon 
The research question is how to improve the H-index for  accommodating the group of researchers who have a number  of highly cited papers, and researchers those have many papers  but with a few citations? 
Gagolewski7, studied the use of the geometric analysis to  the data set of the citation distribution. They performed analysis  by  mapping  the  characteristic  of  the  distribution  data  set  of  researcher’s citations. Three types of researchers are defned  as  follows  i.e.  perfectionist  researcher,  moderate  researcher,  big  producer. Among  these,  the  productive  and  perfectionist  researchers are not well accommodated in H-Index calculation  method1,3,10. 
Radko in 2016, classifed four groups of researchers have  the same H-index are as follows:  
a)  researchers who have n  number of paper and  n citation b)  researchers who have “infnitely many” number of papers  
and n citation 
c)  researchers who have  n  number of papers and “infnitely  
many” citations  
d)  researchers  who  have  n   number  of  papers  with  
“infnitely many” number of citations, plus they have  
“infnitely many” papers with n number of citation3.  
Three groups were excluded on H-index, i.e. group B,  C and D. Figure 1 shows four groups researcher (A, B, C  and D). 
We  would  like  to  introduce  the  notion  of  fairness  in  our  RA-index.  The  defnition  of  fairness  in  Cambridge  Dictionary is “the quality of treating people equally or in a  way that is right or reasonable”16. From Fig. 1, it is unfair if  the researchers’ performance of researcher groups i.e. B, C  and D have the same as h-index value of group A, because  they have more citation and or more papers. Group B, C and  D should have the higher h-index than groupA.  
Likewise,  it  will  be  fair  if  group  D  has  the  highest  h-index.  In  order  to  make  the  H-index  calculation  more  sensitive and fairer? A method to measure the fairness index  is provided. Discrimination index used to differentiate the  calculation of index value of the group of A, B, C and D.  Discrimination  is  opposite  of  fairness.  Discrimination  is  treatment of a person or group of persons differently, because  
of  skin  colour,  sex,  sexuality17.  Discrimination  in  this  paper  is performance calculation treatment of a person or group of  researchers  differently,  because  several  of  their  number  of  papers and citations in upper-h-tail, lower-h-tail18, and uncited  papers was excluded by the h-index calculation. 
Two main parameters for the h-index calculation are the  number of citations and the number of papers. Discrimination  is due to: 
• The number of citations in upper-h-tail and lower-h- 
tail are not counted 
• The number of papers in upper-h-tail and lower-h- 
tail are not counted. 
Uncited papers do not have the contribution to increase  the  h-index.  It  seems  the  paper  does  not  exist,  or  the  paper  was not indexed. Likewise, citations’ addition for papers in the  outside of the h-index core does not contribute to improve the  h-index value. If papers have no citations, it means the papers  do  not  have  much  infuence  on  science,  and  therefore,  they  have no great results19. 
Nevertheless,  in  our  country,  which  has  many  new  authors need to have the h-index, this reason makes a problem.  They have been hard work but may need more time to get a  citation for their papers. On the other hand, our government  policy requires the h-index value for the researcher career. So,  we need calculation method that has been more sensitive than  h-index. 
Therefore,  new  measuring  tool  to  calculate  the  discrimination index and can be used to rank scientists required.  Discrimination  index  is  important,  because  it  can  contribute  to  differentiate  researchers  who  have  the  same  h-index  by  calculating the discrimination it receives from the results from  the h-index calculations. 
Figure  2  shows  the  comparison  of  H-index  from  the  citation data set. In this work, data set is gained from the Scopus

database in January 3rd, 2018. This fgure shows  that Egghe  has the H-index of 24, which is lower than that of Sangwal’s  H-index (26), although the top cited papers and the number  of papers of Egghe are more than Sangwal. This shows that  there is a discrimination on that case. Therefore, it is important  to measure the level of discrimination of the indices’ method.  The index value that has a smaller discrimination index, it is  fairer20.  
Figure 2 shows an example of where the bias. The high  cited papers of Egghe are more than those of Sangwal, but the  H-index of Sangwal, which is 26, is higher than the H-index

of Egghe (24). The frst hypothesis is that the high citation of  paper of an author does not correlate directly to the H-index.  The second hypothesis is that the number of indexed papers  on the lower-h-tail does not contribute to the increase of the  H-index.  
Figure 2 shows the weaknesses of the H-index. This fgure  shows the log diagram of the number of paper and the citation  for two top researchers (Egghe and Sangwal). The production  of paper by Egghe is more than that of Sangwal, but  the H-index of Sangwal is 26, which is higher than  Egghe (24). 
In order to provide the fgure of the discrimination  for this work, a calculation comparison sample of the  H-index  calculation  value  is  used.  The  parameters  to be compared are the number of cited papers, the  total number of citations, and the number of papers.  Figure 2 shows the comparison of H-index from the  citation data set. 
To  compare  of  the  researchers  based  on  their  h-index, three parameters has been considered are as  follows. 
• First parameter, comparing the number of  
cited papers of researcher (m) and number  
of cited papers of h-index (n), as shown in  
Fig. 3a. 
• Second parameter, comparing the total     
of  indexed  papers  based  on  h-index  calculation  (n),  as  shown in Fig. 3c. 
The  discrimination  index  value  is  obtained  from  some  vectors such as the absolute and real vector obtained 21. It has a  value between 0 and 1. The discrimination index is the opposite  of the fairness index 21. 
Discrimination index = 1 – Fairness index 
         (1) 
The  defnition  of  fairness  index  here  is  perceived  as  a  factor of fairness received and represented into a number of

We  proposed  some  parameters  for  calculating  the  discrimination index as follows. 
•	 
•	 
• 
α0  is the square of the H-index, and  αt 	 is a total number of  citations of a researcher 
β0 	 is the number of papers of the H-index calculation, and  is βt  the number of papers of researcher 
The total number of the cited papers of researcher is γt,  and the number of cited papers in H-index calculation is  γ0. It depends on the H-index value, for example γ0 	 = 	 3,  the number of cited papers based on H-index calculation  is 3. Likewise, γ0 	 = 	 3, so the number of the cited papers  based on H-index calculation is 10. 
Discrimination index can be calculated as:  
α 	 = 	 αt 	 / 	 α0                   (6) β 	 = 	 βt 	 / 	 β0                                            (7) γ 	 = 	 γt 	 / 	 γ0                                            (8)

In order to prove the proposed method, this paper used  the citation data set from Scopus. Here, the author names are  from the list of the top cited researcher from the webometrics  site22.  The  webometrics  site  provides  the  ranking  of  highly  cited researchers’ data. On the other hand, Scopus is a database  owned by Elsevier. Scopus indexed journals and books along  with bibliographic data of authors and publishers. Scopus has  indexed  more  than  22,748  peer-reviewed  journals  and  over  3,643 journals with full open access types23.  
Scopus  provides  data  access  services  through  two  ways as follows 1) Accessing the web with an authenticated  user  password  at  http://scopus.com,  2)  Accessing  the  data  via  an  Application  programming  Interface  (ApI)  by  token  authentication and Internet protocol (Ip) listed by Scopus, via  URL address http://api.elsevier.com. 
Both modes of access can be done if the user has been  registered to Scopus services. This paper used the ApI access,  since the website access takes a lot of time to retrieve citation  data  set.  For  example,  data  set  of  a  researcher  can  take  3-5  minutes to be retrieved by the web access, whereas the data  taken in this study was about 1,000 researchers’ data set.  
Indeed, accessing data through ApI service is preferable.  Here, Scopus has data set restriction through ApI as follows 1)  Use a given ApI key, with a maximum limit of 10 ApI keys per  user, 2) Limits the data queries on Scopus to 50,000 queries per  seven days, 3) Each query is limited to 200 results, and 4) Each  citation data takes 2-3 seconds per citation per paper. 
Based  on  Scopus  restrictions,  it  is  necessary  to  defne

The  weaknesses  of  the  H-Index  have  currently  become    some objects to debate, and several proposals for the calculation  method suggest alternative schemes for improving the H-Index  method. Therefore, we propose our RA-Index method with the  advantage of accommodating lower-h-tail and uncited-h-tail. 
Figure 6 (a), shows two shading areas A (upper-h-tail) and  B (lower-h-tail) that was excluded in H-index calculation. Figure  6 (b). shows the calculation of G-index, which accommodate  the area of A in Figure 6 (a). Figure 6 (c). It shows the RA- index, which consider half of area C in Figure 6 (b). 
Methodology to construct RA-index is as follows:

After  data  collection  process  fnished,  we  obtained  the  data of 1,710 researchers, and then continued to prepare the  data set. 
Figure 5 shows the Scopus data of the search results from  the list of names of world’s top webometrics researchers. The  researchers’ data were clustered on the range of the H-Index.  Table 2. shows the data recapitulation obtained from the range  of H-index from 1 to 54, 55 to 108, 109 to 162 and 163 to  216.

5.1 Parameters  Identification  
To  identify  RA-index,  we  used  the  parameters  as  follows: 
• Geometric area concept of the H-index method • Accumulation  of  the  number  of  citations  based  on  
G-index 
• Giving weight for uncited papers and indexed paper that  
has the number of citations that is less than the H-index  
value 
• Measurement  of  the  discrimination  index  of  the  RA- 
index

Identifcation  of  the  characteristic  of  citation.  The  function set of a citation data set can be stated as follows7:  
•

Figure 7 shows data set citation function, the data were  sorted from the highest to the lowest number of citations. Function Fc(x) describes the characteristic of the data set  function as a step function. Each step is represented by  x ,  and x is an element of natural numbers. 
All of x  are members of the positive real numbers, so that  the function Fc(x)  is a member of the natural number. 
5.3   RA1 calculation 
The third step is the calculate the area of upper-h-tail and  h-core of citation function.  
The equation can be written as follows:

5.4 RA2 calculation 
The  fourth  step  considers  the  third  parameter.  The  parameters  are  1)  the  number  of  uncited  papers  and  2)  the  number of papers with the citations, which is lower than RA value. Based on Lucio method, the number of papers that can 1 be used as a reference for the performance of the researchers 24.  The equation can be written as follows:

Finally RA-index is  RA  where is  RA   less than or equal to  the paper number of i. 
Figure  8  shows  the  concept  of  RA-index  area  of  the  calculation  method.  RA-index  is  relatively  higher  than  the  G-index of ΔCD, because RA-index considers uncited-h-tail  and lower-h-tail areas to increase the ra  value. Therefore, from  the propose method the productive researchers  index values  will be accommodated.

From Eq. (11):  RA1=RAi-1,Which is RAi-1 ≥ 	 i 
which is 9%. This mean that RA-index is fairer than H-index.  
However, the deviation standard of RA-index is 11% higher

highly  cited  papers  and  has  many  cited  paper  and  uncited  paper  under  the  H-core. This  improvement  can  enhance  the  measurement sensitivity of the H-index. The correlation test  between  H-index  and  RA-index  is  0.973  by  the  pearson’s  product Moment. The reliability test using Cronbach Alpha of  RA-index is 0,842. The pearson correlation test and Cronbach  Alpha test of RA-index is high, which means that the RA-index  is valid and reliable as an alternative method for quantifying  researcher’s impact. 
Furthermore,  we  found  that  the  standard  deviation  of  the RA-index method is 11%, which is higher than that of the  H-index method (9%). High standard deviation indicates that  the discriminations’ points are spread out over a wider range of  the discrimination index. The RA-index has the lowest average  discrimination index. It can be concluded that the RA-index is  fairer than the H-index.
