The papers provides quantitative and qualitative description of three dimensional (3D) printing research based  on global publications output (7309 publications) in the feld as indexed in Scopus database covering the 10-year  period 2007-2016. 3D printing research registered 54.61 per cent growth per annum and averaged 10.59 citations per  papers in 10 years, and bulk of global output (93.79 %) in the feld emanates from just top 16 countries. The papers  further provides an insight into  qualitative performance of 3D printing research in terms of relative citation index,  citations per papers, highly cited papers, top 25 global organisations and authors in the feld, most favoured subjects  in the feld, and most favoured materials, technologies, and applications used in the feld.  The study concludes that  3D printing is the next revolution in industrial manufacturing led by USA and China. Asian and Pacifc countries  should take initiatives to support 3D printing research through appropriate policy and funding mechanisms as well  as encourage research teams to collaborate with leading international hubs in 3D printing research.

Three  dimensional  (3D)  printing  is  about  building  3D  objects of virtually any shape from a digital model or fle by  successively creating layers of material on top of each other.  3D  printing  is  also  known  as  rapid  prototyping  or  additive  manufacturing. 3D printing is a disruptive technology that has  transformed prototype manufacturing in a major way, offering  the industry new and inexpensive avenues to convert 3D CAD  design to a real life functional objects, and creating complex  three  dimensional  shapes  in  a  smart  and  cost  effective  way.  3D  printing  technologies  replaces  traditional  machine  tool  based  subtractive  processes  such  as  molding,  casting,  and  cutting, used earlier in creating prototypes. 3D printing fnds  applications  across  various  industries  such  as  architecture,  construction, industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military,  engineering, civil engineering, dental and medical industries,  biotech (human tissue replacement), fashion, footwear, jewelry,  eyewear,  education,  geographical  information  systems,  food  and many other felds1.  
3D printing offers compelling business opportunities for  companies  to  grow.  Innovative  designing,  high  adaptability  levels,  less  time  to  market,  the  ability  to  manufacture  parts  without  expensive  tooling,  and  reduced  turnaround  time  for  making  a  prototype  are  some  of  the  factors  that  are  driving  industry  for  early  adoption  of  3D  printing.  Instead  of  outsourcing  prototyping  process,  which  in  the  past  used

to  result  in  additional  costs  and  increased  turnaround  time,  original equipment manufacturers can now print a prototype  overnight  and  at  one  fourth  of  the  cost  using  3D  printing.  Polymers are the most preferred 3D print materials because of  their fexibility and strength. Metals are expected to be adopted  as 3D print material in the future, as components that need to  withstand high temperature and pressure can be manufactured  using 3D printers with metals as print material. However, 3D  printers cannot be used for mass manufacturing, owing to the  size constraint. A 3D printer will not be able to print more than  one object at a time2.  
The  3D  printing  market  is  segmented  on  the  basis  of  technology, material, application, and region. The 3D printing  technology  segment  includes  technologies  such  as  stereo- lithography  (SLA),  laser  sintering,  electron  beam  melting  (EBM), fused disposition modelling (FDM), laminated object  manufacturing  (LOM),  three  dimensional  inkjet  printing  (3IDP), and other technologies. The material segment includes  materials such as polymers, metals/alloys, and others (glass,  ceramics,  wood,  and  composites).  The  application  segment  includes  prototyping  and  tooling,  R&D  and  innovation,  manufacturing complex components, and others (customisation,  personalisation, and aftermarket)2. 
1.1  Literature review

many, and Japan which dominate the feld  
43 43 
with two-third of the world output, 66.12  
36 39 
per  cent  global  publications  share.  The  
36 36 
remaining  top  11  countries  account  for  
less than one-third, 27.88 per cent global

Australia  and  South  Korea  dominate  3D  
27 28 
printing research more in qualitative terms

compared to the rest of the world. In order  
26 26 
that Asian and Pacifc countries including  
South  Korea,  Australia,  Singapore,  Tai- 
26 26 
wan  and  India  are  able  to  become  more  
25 25 
competitive and perform better in future,  
25 25 stakeholders  across  such  nations  should  
19 25 
support 3D printing research through ap- 
19 24 
propriate policy and funding mechanisms  697 763 
as well as encourage research teams to col- 4174 4603 
laborate with leading international hubs in  
3D  printing  research.  India  in  particular  16.70 16.58 
should  take  initiative  to  come  up  with  a  
national  action  plan  for  advancement  of  
3D printing in the country. At present its global publications  
share is just 1.61 per cent.
