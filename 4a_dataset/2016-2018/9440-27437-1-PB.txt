1.  INtrODUctION 
In the 20th  century, the library was opened for people’s  use.  After  the  development  of  ICT,  things  have  been  changed.  There  are  documents  in  electronic  form  that  documents are made available to everyone with the help  of internet. Internet helps to access anything at anywhere  without any boundaries. So, internet brought the concept  of  accessing  information  stored  in  the  network  around  the  world.  It  is  made  available  for  public  access,    and  private  access  with  the  help  of  technology.  After  the  successful  directory  of  open  access  journal,  now  the  directory  of  open  access  of  books  has  emerged  in  this  direction. An attempt has been made to study and analyse  the  directory  of  open  access  books  for  the  purpose. 
1.1    Directory  of  Open Access  Books  (DOAB) 
The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) is  a  service to provide open access on monographs. It  provides  a  searchable  index  with  links  to  the  full-  texts  of  the  publications  at  the  publisher’s  website  or  repository  for  peer-reviewed monographs through open access business  model.  It  invites  the  academic  publishers  to  provide  the  metadata  of  their  open  access  books  to  DOAB.  To  increase dissemination, impact and visibility, the content  format  should  be  in  interoperable  metadata  format.  So  the libraries can integrate the directory into their online  catalogues,  thereby  helping  scholars,  students  and  the  general  public  to  discover  the  books.  The  aggregators  may  integrate  the  records  in  their  commercial  services.  The DOAB is open to all academic publishers to provide  the data. The main aims are to fulfill  all the subjects as  well  as  all  languages  which  consists  of  many  books  as  possible1. The  DOAB was officially launched on 1 July  2013 at the Open Access Monographs in the Humanities  
and Social Sciences Conference at the British Library in  London2.  However,  unofficially  it  was  operating  since  2011  and  its  beta  version  was  launched  in  2012.  The  DOAB  is  a  service  of  the  Open  Access  Publishing  in  European  Networks  (OAPEN)  Foundation. The  OAPEN  Foundation  is  an  international  initiative  dedicated  to  open access monograph publishing, based at the National  Library,  The  Hague3.  The  DOAB  is  being  developed  in  close  cooperation  with  Lars  Bjørnshauge  and  Salam  Baker  Shanawa  (Director  of  Semper  Tool),  who  were  also  responsible  for  the  development  of  the  Directory  of  Open Access  Journals  (DOAJ)4. 
1.2 type  of  Licences 
The main intention of the authors is to maximise the  research results impact. Copyright should not be hindrance  against  this  intension.  There  exists  websites  and  tools  to  find  out  the  journals  and  rights  they  are  granting  for  distribution,  reuse,  etc.  So,  the  authors  have  to  rethink  about  how  their  work  will  be  carried  out  further  and  they  should  choose  right  journals  to  publish. 
Proper licensing improves and enhances the scientific  progress  and  also  honors  the  authors  by  retaining  the  copyright  of  the  authors  of  their  own  intellectual  work.  Open access are author-friendly, reader-friendly, research- friendly. If the author allows additional of his derivative  work, then the newly created work will follow the same  license  terms. This  idea  is  called  as  ‘ShareAlike’  and  it  is inspired by the General Public License (GNU) which  is used by many free and open source software projects.  The  various  types  of  Licences  are  as  under:

included  in  online  public  access  catalogue  (OPAC).  Readers  can  also  find  e-books  through  search  engines  (such as Google), library OPAC or the publisher platform  which  make  them  more  exposed  and  visible  to  a  larger  audience5.  E-books  offer  a  number  of  advantages  over  their  print  for  all  stakeholders,  i.e.,  patrons,  libraries,  authors  and  publishers.  For  patrons,  e-books  offer  24/7  availability, remote access (accessible outside the physical  walls  of  a  library),  full-text  searching,  changeable  font  size, accurate presentation and possession for an unlimited  time. For libraries, e-books require no circulation, no shelf  space or re-shelving and are never lost, damaged, stolen,

or  overdue6.  Brody7   studied  the  research  access/impact  problem i.e., the journal articles are not accessible to all  of  their  users.  Hence,  they  are  losing  potential  research  activities  and  their  impact.  The  solution  is  to  make  all  articles available in open access. The open access articles  have  significantly  higher  citation  impact  than  non-open  access  articles.  There  are  two  roads  which  is  ‘golden’  and  ‘green’  road.  Only  5  %  of  journals  are  in  gold,  but  more  than  90  %  are  already  green  yet  only  about  20  %  of  articles  have  been  self-archived.  The  e-books  with  CC license listed in DOAB are downloaded almost twice  (181 %) as compared to e-books with a more restrictive  license  available  in  the  OAPEN  Library  in  a  period  of  one year from June 2013-May 20148. This is the reason  that DOAB includes e-books available through the CC or  comparable  licenses.  Even  the  e-books  available  in  the  OAPEN  Library  with  a  more  restrictive  license  aren’t  included  in  DOAB.  
The DOAB is being developed in close cooperation  with Lars Bjørnshauge and Salam Baker Shanawa (Director  of  SemperTool),  who  were  also  responsible  for  the  development  of  the  Directory  of  Open  Access  Journals  (DOAJ)9.  Loan10   found  that  307  e-books  under  three  categories–monographs  (68.08  %),  book  series  (30.29  %)  and  conference  proceedings  (1.63  %)  are  available  for  science  and  technology  through  DOAB.    These  e-books  deal  with  8  major  subject  areas  of  Science  and  technology having 36 sub-fields. The maximum number  of  e-books  is  available  for  the  subjects  like  general  science, technology & engineering, earth & environmental  sciences;  and  health  &  medical  sciences. 
3.  OBJEctIVES

are  by ANU  Press  which  includes  367  (10.86  %)  books  which  has  no  licenses  and  only  one  book  has  CC-BY- NC-SA  license  and  it  is  the  first  position  while  ranking  the  publishers. 
Chi-square  test  is  applied  for  further  discussion  about  the  licenses  of  open  access  books  with  respect  to  publishers. The computed Chi-square value is 14708.302  which  is  higher  than  its  tabulated  value  at  5  %  level  of  significance.  Hence  the  difference  among  licenses  wise  publication  is  statistically  identified  as  highly  significant  with  respect  to  publisher  wise  open  access  books  in  DOAB. 
5.3  Language-wise  Distribution  of  Books  
The  languages-wise  distribution  of  books  available  in  the  DOAB  has  been  analysed  and  it  is  shown  in  the  Table  3.  Among  the  3379,  1584  (46.88%)  books  are  published  by  English  which  includes  445  (13.17  %)  books  which  has  no  licenses,  83  books  (2.46  %)  has  CC BY, 153 books (4.53 %) has CC- BY-NC, 814 books  (24.09  %)  has  CC-BY-NC-ND,  36  books  (1.07  %)  has  CC-BU-NC-SA,  24  (0.7)  book  has  CC-BY-ND  and  29  (0.86  %)  book  has  CC-BY-SA  licenses.  It  is  revealed  from  the  table,  only  one  book  each  published  in  the  languages  like  Welsh,  Swedish,  Russian  and  Espanola  are  available  in  DOAB. 
The  Chi-square  test  is  for  the  licenses  of  with  respect  to  language  wise  distribution  of  open  access  books  on  DOAB.  The  computed  Chi-square  value  is  6042.093  which  is  higher  than  its  tabulated  value  at  5  percent level of significance. Hence the difference among  licenses  wise  publication  is  statistically  identified  as  highly  significant  with  respect  to  language  wise  open  access  books  in  DOAB.

and is presented in Table 4. During the period of 1866 to  2015 totally 3379 books were published. The publication  year  were  categorised  like  upto  1980,  1981  to  1990,  1991  to  2000,  2001  to  2010  and  2011  to  2015. Among  the 3379, 35 books (1.04 %) are published before 1980,  which  includes  31  books  (0.92  %)  has  no  licenses,  3  books  (0.09  %)  has  CC-BY-NC-SA  and  only  one  book  CC-BY-NC-ND  licenses.  And  22  books  (0.65  %)  in  1981  to  1990,  161  books  (4.76  %)  in  1991  to  2000  and  1525  books  (45.13  %)  in  2001  to  2010.  The  first  book  was  published  in  the  year  1866  and  the  second  book  in  1867  but  after  the  1867  to  1927  there  were  no  books  mentioned  it  is  evidence  from  source. 
The Chi-square test was applied for further discussion  about the year-wise publication of open access books with  respect to type of licenses. The computed Chi-square value  is  532.750  which  is  higher  than  its  tabulated  value  at  5  %  level  of  significance.  Hence,  the  difference  among

5.5.  Year-wise Addition  of  Books  and type  of  
Licenses 
Table 5 shows the licenses-wise distribution of open  access  books  available  in  DOAB  which  are  categories  based  on  year-wise  added  on  DOAB.  Out  of  3379,  487  books (14.41 %) added in 2011, 702 books (20.77 %) in  2012, 365 books (10.8 %) in 2013, 920 books (27.22 %)  in  2014  and  905  books  (26.78  %)  added  in  2015  with  DOAB. Among the 3379, 807 books (23.88 %) have no  licenses,  97  books  (2.87  %)  have  CC-BY,  351  books  (10.39 %) have CC BY-NC, 1438 books (42.56 %) have  CC  BY-NC-ND,  464  books  (13.73  %)  have  CC  BY- NC-SA,  175  books  (5.18  %)  have  CC  BY-ND  and  47  books  (1.39  %)  have  CC  BY-SA  licenses.  It  is  revealed  from  the  table,  more  than  50  %  of  books  were  added  in  2014  and  2015.  
Chi-square  test  is  applied  for  the  licenses  of  open  access  books  with  respect  to  year  of  added  on  DOAB  versus licenses. The computed Chi-square value is 1407.314  which  is  higher  than  its  tabulated  value  at  5  %  level  of  significance. Hence, the difference among licenses-wise

7.  cONcLUSIONS 
The open access movement is exclusive and important   in the current digital era. It is evident that the scholarly  communication forms like articles, monographs, reports,  etc. are available open access mode. There are directories  coming  out  with  sole  publications  as  journals,  books,  repositories  and  so  on.  They  satisfy  the  end  users  for  getting  more  documents  through  open  access  mode  without spending more money. The DOAB is a platform  to have more visibility for open access books to the users  communities. The publishers as well as authors should take  initiative to share the books in the DOAB. It paves way  to integrate open access books links to the library online  catalogue. The library professionals can also utilise this  facility by way of giving link to the library catalogue. It
