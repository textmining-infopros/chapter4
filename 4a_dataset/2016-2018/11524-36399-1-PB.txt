AbStRAct 
The  survey  is  an  attempt  to  determine  and  fnd  the  present  status  of  awareness,  accessibility  and  use  of  electronic resources among library and information science research scholars of Jiwaji University Gwalior, like;  CD-ROM databases, online databases, online journals, OPAC etc. The study was done to fnd out the challenges,  benefts, and progress gained by research scholars while accessing the e-resources.  It is found out through study  that ‘Shodhganga’ was mostly used (95 per cent) by research scholars, followed by DOAJ. It was also found  out that research scholars got information about available e-resources and databases in their institute through the  library website (45.5 per cent), followed by searching on Internet. A detailed result of this survey was discussed  and recommendations were made to improve and enhance the usage of e-resources.

1.  IntRodUctIon 
With the advent of new information and communication  technologies  (ICT),  a  number  of  electronic  resources  are  developed  such  as  e-journals,  e-books,  emails,  e-patens,  e-databases,  e-standards,  e-thesis,  e-chats,  etc. The  speed  of  Internet enhanced from 2G to 4G, which drastically improve the  communication of information around the globe, which helps  to  develop  the  subscription  of  e-resources,  reduces  the  time  taken  to  reach  information  to  researchers. These  changes  in  communication technology radically improve role of librarians  in managing, organising and disseminating the information to  the end-users in effective and effcient way. 
Evaluation of awareness and usage of electronic resources  among the user community is always a challenging task for  libraries.  Multiple  factors  are  involved  and  infuencing  to  know the satisfaction level and usage of e-resources, whether  it  may  be  an  academic  community  or  scientists  involved  in  R&D  projects  or  among  working  professionals.  Evaluation  of available resources is always necessary for any institution/ organisation, to be done time to time, so that more effective  services and support can be provide to users, in supporting their  research work. A survey was done to evaluate the awareness  and usage of e-resources among library and information science  research scholars studying in Jiwaji University, Gwalior.  
Electronic  resources  are  becoming  an  integral  part  of  collection  of  any  institution/organisation.  ICT  has  made

possible  to  grow  the  publishing  industry  of  e-resources  in  leaps and bounds and helps to provide the required and quality  information to the users round the clock, under the user’s reach  through any smart device. Majority of publication houses and  societies  are  publishing  information  electronically  by  use  implementing new and advance technology as per the demand  and convenience of the users after doing a number of surveys  for  services.  These  invaluable  and  up  to  date  information  resources  are  not  only  irreplaceable  for  research  scholars,  scientists but also to faculty members who involved in research  and  development  projects.  As  the  e-resources  is  providing  information regarding current research to scholars without any  delay after online publication on their desktop. Thus it reduces  the time period to reach information to them. The e-resources  are best means for research scholars to update their knowledge  timely. 
1.1 About  Institute 
School  of  Studies  in  Library  and  Information  Science  was established in the Jiwaji University, Gwalior in 1984 to  impart quality education and modern skills in the feld to the  students of the region leading to bachelor, master, and doctorate  degree in library and information science. The Department is  extensively engaged in teaching, research and career guidance  too. This job oriented course has been modernised with use of  the latest equipment in teaching and training at degree, post  graduate and research level.

2. REvIEw  of  LItERAtURES 
According to Sharma1  electronic resources has provided a  number of facilities to researchers in searching, arranging, and  analysing information which is not available in print resources.  Academic  users  mostly  preferred  to  access  e-resources  for  searching  and  acquiring  information  for  their  research  and  academic purposes2-5. 
haridasan & Khan6  in their study suggested that academic  faculty members were well aware about the e-resources and  the facilities available in electronic books, journals, thesis, CD- ROM and OPAC. And suggest that faculty members strongly  recommended to improve the computer and internet literacy to  search and access e-resources at their institutions. 
Nazir7 found  out  in  his  study,  that  lack  of  assistance  by  library  personnels  and  less  orientation  and  awareness  programmes about the subscription of e-resources available in  library are major causes of less usage of library by users. User- training  and  orientation/awareness  programmes  should  be  organised for faculty members and staff both for searching and  usage of e-resources8-11. More online tutorials and user guides/ manuals should be designed and distributed among users about  the services and e-resources and library staff should reach users  personally, to assist in using online resources.  
Ali12, discussed that lack of training by library staff for  using digital resources, untrained library staff, lack of fnancial  support,  different  variety  user’s  query,  poor  library  ICT  infrastructure are some of the main reasons in less usage of  e-resources. Pamphlets, library guides and online handbooks  should be distributed among users in electronic & print format  for more publicity of current resources subscribed by library  online. 
Khan  &  haridasan8  also  found  that  library  users  in  University of Delhi (DU) are more actively using e-resources  and  aware  about  the  services  of  library  in  comparison  with  Aligarh  Muslim  University  (AMU)  users.  The  study  also  revealed that users are using e-resources for current information  search and download on internet, but once they got softcopy of  the required paper, they will take print out and read it. Therefore  the e-resources are not much utilised at DU & AMU. 
lack  of  information  literacy  skill,  slow  Internet  connectivity  in  the  institution,  uneven  power  supply,  less  number of computers, poor infrastructure of library, less space  for reading in library, inadequate assistance from library staff  are  reasons  due  to  which  users  are  facing  problems  while  using  the  e-resources3,4,13-15.  University  library  should  take  a  leading role to create more awareness and give more publicity  about subscribed electronic resources by conducting training  and  retraining  programs,  organising  workshop,  conferences  and seminars, so as to increase the use of the services. Islam  & habiba16  found out in the study that faculty members and  students were unsatisfed with the limited numbers of computers  in library, slow download speed of internet and less number of  journals titles subscribed by the library. This constraint affects  the use of internet and library resources by the users. Satpathy  & Rout17  suggested that more number of electronic journals and  facility of high speed internet by library will improve the usage. 
Roy & Kumar18  suggested that user’s interface of electronic  resources and databases are very complicated, due to which the  
usage of resources decreases. Sinh & Nhung19  found that users  are  facing  main  problem  while  searching  online  databases  and journals due to poor search skills, complex interface, less  knowledge of english languages and slow internet speed.  
Kattimani20  in his study recommended that simple search  is  mostly  preferred  and  favourite  technique  used  by  users,  whereas  users  are  rarely  using  advance  search  interface  for  required  information.  Prasad  &  Singh4   had  shown  that  PD f was the most preferred format for online journals. Mucnjak21 discuss that in humanity subject, users are more using online  databases than print resources. The reason behind the increase  in  usage  of  electronic  resources  may  be  good  quality  and  specifc  subject  of  e-journals  selection,  recommended  by  faculty members of humanities and social science group. 
3.  PURPoSE 
To study the use of online resources, enough efforts have  been done to know about awareness, problem and prospects  among lIs   research  scholars  of  Jiwaji  University,  Gwalior,  by  the  help  of  survey  study.  The  study  will  be  helpful  in  reorienting electronic resources services in university library  and  to  coordinate  them  with  ever  changing  demands  of  the  research scholars. 
4.    o bJEctIvES 
The objectives of this study is to fnd out: 
• Usage of electronic resources among research scholar’s  
for their academic work 
• The benefts that research scholar associate with electronic  
resources 
• Challenges  to  research  scholar  encounter  in  assessing  
electronic resources 
• To study the use of different types of online databases • To fnd the problems faced by the research scholars while  
accessing and using e-resources and online databases • To  determine  the  satisfaction  level  among  the  users  of  
e-resources. 
5.  MEthodoLoGy 
survey (questionnaire) method is used to study the usage  of  e-resources.  A  structured  questionnaire  was  designed  to  collect data from the lIs  research scholars of Jiwaji University,   Gwalior,  keeping  in  mind  the  basic  objectives  of  the  study.  Research scholars were contacted personally to collect data.  Apart from this, personal interviews were also conducted with  research scholars to discuss the problems faced by them while  using electronic resources for research studies.  
6.  RESULtS And fIndInGS 
The 40 questionnaires were distributed among library and  information science (lIs) research scholars during PhD Course  work at Jiwaji University (JU), Gwalior. Out of which only 22  flled questionnaires were received from 11 male and female  research scholars each. The data collected was tabulated and  analysed by the help of sPss  software, to extract the better  understanding about the usage and awareness of e-resources  among research scholars.

  The  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  fnd  out  the  awareness of usage of e-resources among research scholars at  JU, Gwalior in lIs  feld. The data collected shows that the all  research scholars respondents are using e-resources provided  by university and college libraries for the research work. 
As  the  e-resources  is  providing  information  regarding  current research to scholars without any delay on their desktop,  thus it reduces the time period to reach information to them. 
After analysis of data from Table 2, it was found that 3 (14  %) of the lIs  research scholars are using e-resources since less  than 01 year, 11 (50 %) are using from 1-4 years, 6 research  scholars (27 %) are using from 5-6 years and 2 (9 %) are using   e-resources more than 8 years. The result shows an encouraging  picture as the usage of e-resources among research scholars is  increasing with time. 
Regarding  analysis  of  how  long  the  age  group  of  researchers is using e-resources shown in Table 2 It was found  after analysing the data, that in age group of 21-25 yrs, out of  4 researchers, 3 (75 %) are using from 1-4 yrs. In age group of  26-30 yrs, out of 8 researchers, 6 (75 %) are using from 1-4 yrs  and 2 (25 %) are using e-resources less than one year. In third  age group of 31-35yrs, out of 4, 2 (50 %) are using since 5-8  yrs, 1 (25 %) each using since 1-4 yrs and more than 8 years.  The age group of 36-40 yrs, out of total 6 users, 4 (75 %) are  using since 5-8 yrs and 1 (25 %) each using under age group of  1-4 yrs, and more than 8 years.

ScienceDirect  Database:  After  analysing  the  data  in  
Table  3,  the  use  of  ScienceDirect  database  among  LIS  
researchers, 5 (23 %) are only using it for their research  
purpose, rest 17 (77 %) are not using it. It indicates that  
as ScienceDirect is database covers less research papers  
in LIS subject area, therefore its usage is very less among  
LIS scholars. 
Library  &  Information  Science  Abstract:  Library  and  
Information  science  Abstracts  (lIsA)  is  the  main  
source  of  information  in  feld  of  lIs.  As  shown  in  
Table  3,  majority  14  (64  %)  scholars  of  lIs   feld  
are using it and rest 8 (36 %) are not referring it. Library,  Information  Science  and  Technology  Abstract:  
Library,  Information  Science  and  Technology  Abstract  
(lIsTA)23  is covering full text papers in database of LIS.  
After  analysing  the  usage  of  lIsTA  (Table  3),  it  was  
found that only 4 (18 %) are using it and rest 18 (82 %)  
are not referring lIsTA for their research work. It shows  
that lIsTA is less known among lIs  researchers at JU  
Gwalior. 
Networked  Digital  Library  for  Thesis  and  Dissertations:  
networked Digital library for Thesis and Dissertations  
(nDlTD)  is  an  international  organisation  which  helps  
in  promoting  in  creation, maintenance  and  preservation  
of  electronic  thesis  and  dissertation  (ETDs). As  shown  
in Table 3, majority of research scholars, 12 (55 %) are  
using it for research studies and rest 10 (45 %) has not  
referred it. 
Directory of Open Access Journals: Directory of Open Access  
Journals  (DOAJ)  is  an  online  directory  of  open  access  
journals.  As  shown  in  Table  3,  majority  of  research  
scholars, 17 (77 %) are using DOAJ database and 5 (23%)  
are not referring it for research studies. It clearly shows  
that open access journals are referred by good number of  
research scholars and quite popular among them. Emerald Journals: Emerald is publishing 32 journals in feld of  
library and information science, in which it covers research  
papers publish on current trends and technologies. After  
analysing the data from Table 3, shows that 15 (68 %) of  
users are referring Emerald journals out of 22 users. Shodhganga: Shodhganga22   is  an  online  reservoir  of  Indian  
PhD  thesis  published  in  various  Indian  universities,  
hosted by InflIBnET, Ahmedabad. Table 3 shows that  
‘shodhganga’ is most referred (95.5%) database by lIs 
research scholars to pursue their research work.

8. PURPoSE   of  USInG E-RESoURcES 
To fnd the purpose of using e-resources among research  scholars of Jiwaji University, Gwalior, results were analysed  from Table 5 and described below: 
Research Need: Maximum 21 (96 %) scholars urgently need  
the e-resources to carry out their research work, it is main  
source of information for their research studies. Enhancing  Education: To  carry  out  the  academic  studies  in  
colleges and universities, e-resources are main source of  
information among research scholars. Table 5 shows that  
17 (72 %) are regularly using e-resources to complete their  
academic studies and assignments, only 5 (23 %) thinks  
that e-resources are not helpful in enhancing education.  Writing Research Paper: Writing a research paper is essential  
for research scholars in reputed journals, to authenticate  
the studies by subject experts/reviewers. Table 5 shows  
that  17  (77  %)  of  research  scholars  are  taking  help  of  
e-resources in writing research papers and rest 5 (23 %)  
are using other resources. 
Aid for Teaching Assignments: Research fellows at universities  
and colleges are also engaged in academic activities. They  
have also been given the task of teaching undergraduate  
and post graduate students. Table 5 reveals that 9 (41 %)  
are referring e-resources for teaching aid and 13 (59 %) are  
consulting other resources for information in teaching. Updating  the  Domain  Knowledge: Updating  domain knowledge  
time-to-time helps research scholars to keep them abreast  
about the subject domain in their feld. Thus, e-resources  
are main sources of extracting information from various  
sources. Table 5 shows that 14 (64 %) are keep updating  
their  domain  knowledge  through  e-resources  available 
 to them.

13. SUGGEStIonS   fo R IMPRovEMEnt  
To  improve  the  usage  and  awareness  of  e-resources  following suggestion are put forth on the basis of usage analysis  of e-resources among research scholars of Jiwaji University,  Gwalior: 
	Celebrate  special  week/month  on  specifc  subject  in  
coordination  with  various  departments,  libraries  should  
organise  a  series  of  user-orientation  programmes  and  
distribute  special  handbooks/tutorials,  link  to  online  
gateways and list of the resources available in libraries  
60 
and  circulate  them  among  faculty  members  and  
students 
	Central  library  and  college  libraries  needs  to  organise  
various  department-wise  training  and  orientation  
programmes  for  faculty  members  and  students  for  the  
optimum utilisation of available e-resources. Also, should  
organise,  time  to  time,  the  product  demonstrations  and  
trials for the new resources introduced by the publishers for  
the users, to make them aware about recent developments  
in their subject felds. 
	high speed network of Wi-fi as well as leased line should  
be  introduced  in  the  campus  and  hostels,  with  security  
features according to the suitability of users. 
	To  save  the  time  of  users  in  searching  the  information  
about the availability and usage of e-resources, libraries  
should  introduce  content  alert  services,  bulletin  board  
services, library newsletter, pamphlets, training tutorials/

14. REcoMMEndAtIonS And concLUSIonS 
With the development of ICT technologies for improving  digital  environment,  college  and  university  libraries  are  improving  their  infrastructure  and  trying  to  attract  more  users and making libraries more user-friendly. UGC with the  help of InflIBnET, are providing a number of e-resources  and  databases  through  consortium  to  college  and  university  libraries. The user-friendly features of e-resources are attracting  more and more users towards libraries. It not only improves the  quality of research but also make faculty and students more  confdent after having access to large number of e-resources  and databases to their desktop and to keep themselves up-to- date in their relevant subject feld. features of e-resources are  making  users  heavily  dependent  to  get  required  information  timely. 
The challenge to librarian is to make balance in acquisition  of print and electronic resources to meet the users demand. The  librarians should ask all departments to send the priority list of  e-resources  for  procurement  in  the  coming  year  and  consult  all head of the departments before fnalising the subscription  of e-resources collection. Student’s representative should also  be made a member of selection committee in e-resources, to

make the collection development more effective and visible.  Upgrading infrastructure of the libraries, increase in acquisition  of new e-resources and databases, communication should be  improve  between  end-users  and  librarians,  are  some  of  the  main  steps  to  enhance  the  confdence,  awareness  and  usage  of  library  resources.  Librarians  should  organise  pro-actively  end-user training sessions in libraries and also in the various  departments  of  the  college  and  universities.  Special  training  sessions on demand should also be organised to improve the  usage. librarians should coordinate with various departments  to organise user education sessions during seminar/workshops/ conferences organised by them. 
The  users  also  prefer  to  search  the  e-resources  having  simple  and  user-friendly  interface.  librarians  should  make  the  homepage  of  library,  such  that  user  may  get  required  information in minimum clicks on webpage. The webpage of  libraries  should  also  provide  subject  gateways  and  subject- wise  list  of  e-resources  available  in  libraries  to  improve  the  visibility of collection to more number of users. 
The  paper  will  facilitate  university  libraries  to  improve  understanding  about  e-resources  among  faculty  members,  research  scholars  and  students  and  will  organise  more  pro- active end-user training programs to create awareness towards  effective usage of e-resources.
