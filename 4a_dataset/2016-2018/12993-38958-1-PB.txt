The collection development policies of university libraries are driven by the information seeking behaviour  and extent of use of resources by students, researchers and teachers. Libraries have introduced e-books in their  collections with rising demand of users for them. However, e-books have not gained the perceived acceptance  among users. It is essential to understand the gaps in preferences and experiences of users of e-books in academic  libraries so that the collections of e-books can be customised to meet the users’ preferences. The purpose of this  study is to understand how students, teachers and research scholars access, browse and use e-books in Jawaharlal  Nehru University, Delhi, India. The study has identifed factors that encourage or discourage the use of e-books in  academic libraries. It highlights preferences for the format (electronic/print) while perusing books as textbooks or  
reference books for research.

1. INtroDUCtIoN 
With  stupendous  success  and  popularity  of  e-journals,  university  libraries  worldwide  became  enthusiastic  and  this  resulted  in  the  drastic  reduction  in  use  and  subscription  of  print journals1. Following this trend, libraries started including  e-books in their collections to enhance their services. However,  the implementation of e-books in libraries has not cast the kind  of spell that e- journals caused, though the former has most of  the inherent features of the latter. The experts2  cautioned that  transition from print books to e-books would take longer time  as compared to the speedy passage from print to e-journals. 
This  study  has  used  systematic  scientifc  survey  to  understand the gaps between users’ expectations and the actual  facilities  that  e-books  provide  to  support  their  information  seeking activities.  
This  survey  will  help  in  understanding  the  reading  behaviour,  preferences  and  experiences  of  users  for  e-books  as  textbook  or  reference  books;  to  identify,  features  which  encourage or discourage the circulation of e-books in academic  libraries. It will assist in providing enhanced student-centric  services  and  making  judicious  and  optimum  use  of  scarce  fnancial resources of libraries.  
The study will serve as a framework for future surveys,  which may be conducted to examine the evolution of e-book  usage in academic libraries.

The objectives of the study are as follows. 
• To understand the extent of awareness among users  
about the availability of e-books. 
• To know the preferences of users for the format of books  
(print or electronic), when books are used as textbooks,  
scholarly publications, leisurely read, general reference,  
dictionary or encyclopaedia.  
• To understand the liking and disliking of users for  
features of e-books.  
• To highlight users’ perception about the future of  
e-books. 
Null hypotheses 
H01: There is no association between the frequency of visiting  
the  library  and  the  frequency  of  checking  out  of  print  
books. In other words, it is not necessary that users who  
frequently visit library also check out print books.  H02: There is no association between the frequency of visiting  
the library and the time spent in exploring e-resources. H03: There is no association between the frequency of browsing  
library website and time spent in exploring e-resources.

4. MEthoD  of th E StUDy 
The  study  instrumented  questionnaire-based  survey  research  approach  to  understand  the  reading  behaviour  and  examine the gaps in perceptions and experiences in accessing  and  using  e-books  from  library.  The  target  population  for  the  study  included  students  enrolled  in  undergraduate  or  postgraduate courses, research scholars and faculty members  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University.  The  size  of  the  population  was over 8.5 thousand students and research associates and six  hundred faculty members. It is assumed that three constituents  of  the  population,  i.e.,  students,  research  associates  and  teachers, do not differ signifcantly on scholarly information  requirements hence, random sampling approach was adopted  for the study. The sample size was 350 for administration of  questionnaires.  
The  authors  received  121  flled-in  questionnaires  from  the sample of 350 (32 women (26.4 %) and 89 man (73.6 %).  Thus, the response rate was 34.6 percent. When classifed by  the  nature  of  engagement  with  university,  58  were  research  associates,  44  students  were  at  the  postgraduate  level,  3  students  were  at  the  undergraduate  level,  3  were  faculty  members and 2 were research offcers. Thus, 84.3 percent of  the respondents were either students at postgraduate level or  research associates. The authors applied Binominal, Kendall  Tau and Pearson Chi-square tests for analysis. 
   
5. LItErAtUrE rEvIEw 
There are many important studies3,4 that have provided a  detailed review of published literature on use and preferences  and other important issues of e-books. 
5.1   f eatures  of  E-books  which Attract  Users 
Features such as accessibility, credibility, coverage, cost,  visual  and  interactive  content,  portability,  and  the  easy-to- navigate  interface  attract  users  and  enhance  the  circulation  and usage of e-books5. The users also appreciate features of  highlighting and adding annotations6. The features of adding  annotations and sharing enhance users’ engagement and leads  to a rich learning experience7. 
5.2   f eatures  of  E-books  which  Distract  Users 
The higher prices of e-books as well as stringent terms  and  conditions  of  use  prevent  libraries  from  subscribing  to  e-books8. The restrictions on viewing, printing, downloading,  circulating,  interlibrary  loan,  and  sharing  prevent  the  use  of  e-books in libraries. The users are also averse to reading for  long on computer screen9. E-books are available in different  proprietary  formats  which  prevent  their  free  use10. Besides,  libraries  deploy  frewalls  which  adversely  affect  the  use  of  e-books11. The users who are not profcient in using different  features of e-books do not actively use them

5.3   v ariation  in  Perception  with  Discipline  
The preferences for the format of books vary with subject  areas. The use of e-books is not popular among the nursing  faculty 
13. Clinical practitioners use e-books for patient care 71 per cent of the medical students perceive that the use of  e-books  would  enhance  their  productivity,  though  just  38  percent  regularly  use  them 
14.  Students  in  humanities  and  sciences  choose  print  books  over  e-books,  whereas  students  registered  in  professional  courses  like  business,  dentistry,  engineering, law, library science, medicine and pharmacy are  inclined towards e-books 
6.  
2;  
5.4 Preference  of format  for  Different  Purposes 
Experts15 highlighted that users prefer different formats for  different type of documents. They prefer electronic version for  reference, edited collections and citation manuals, but want print  books  for  literature  and  recreational  reading.  Undergraduate  students  prefer  to  read  in  electronic  form16.  Postdoctoral  researchers show the highest inclination for e-books followed  by the graduate and undergraduate students13.  
In the Indian context, two studies17,18  used questionnaire  method  and  reported  users’  preferences  for  print  books.  Ghosh19  reported users’ preferences for mobile device to access  e-books and highlighted barriers in use of e-books and asserted  on spreading awareness about e-books. 
6. DAtA ANALySIS AND  r ESULtS 
6.1 Awareness  about Availability  of  E-books 
Lack  of  awareness  about  e-books  is  the  prime  factor  behind  poor  usage  of  e-books,  despite  best  efforts  made  by  libraries for improving circulation of e-books20.  
Central Library has been using multiple communication  channels to spread awareness about the availability of e-books,  perceiving  that  preferences  of  users  for  communication  channels  may  differ.  To  understand  popularity  of  various  communications  channels,  the  users  were  asked  to  specify  the communication channels from which they learnt about the  availability of e-books in the library. 
Users  have  been  referring  to  multiple  communication  channels.  Seventy-three  (60.3  %)  respondents  learn  about  e-books  through  the  library  website  and  29  (24  %)  get  information  from  library  catalogue. Thus,  about  70  per  cent  of the respondents get information about e-books from various  one-way  technical  communication  channels.  Thirty-two  (26.4 %) respondents got information from colleagues and 11  (9.1 %) were informed by teachers. Thus, about 30 per cent  users relied on human support, i.e., support from colleagues,  teachers, library staff and orientation programmes. Substantial  number of users rely on human support for getting information  about e-books .  
A  majority  of  the  users  (63.6  %)  perceived  that  the  information about arrival of e-books should be made available  on  the  library  website.  Sixty-one  (50.4  %)  users  wanted  that  they  should  be  informed  individually  through  e-mails.  Olney-Zide and Eiford21  reported that one out of three users  surveyed  did  not  know  that  e-books  were  available  in  their  college library, although 120,000 e-books were already there  in the library catalogue. Joo and Choi5 claimed that awareness

6.4  Degree  of  Satisfaction  with  Strength  of  
Collection  of  E-books  
The questionnaire mentioned a few statements pertaining  to the distinct features of e-books, such as easiness, quickness  and user-friendliness in information retrieval and the extent of  coverage of various disciplines in e-book packages subscribed  by  the  Library,  and  asked  users  to  express  the  extent  of  agreement  with  these  statements  on  a  Likert  scale  of  fve  points.  The  weighted  mean  score  of  agreement  with  each  statement, refected in the rightmost column of Table 4, was  computed by assigning weight of –2 to strongly disagree; –1  to disagree, 0 to neutral, 1 to agree and 2 to strongly agree.  The high value of the weighted mean score of the agreement  indicates the extent of agreement with that statement by a large  number of respondents. 
Thirty-two  students  strongly  agreed  that  print  book  collection  in  the  library  met  their  requirements  and  only  15  students strongly agreed that e-book collection met their needs.  It indicates that e-book collection was not strong enough like  the  print  book  collection.  Previous  studies  have  highlighted  that all that is required is not available as e-books, 28Most of  the respondents did not agree with the statement that they did  not refer to e-books older than fve years, thus Library needs to  subscribe to old e-books.  
Forty-fve  respondents  (31.2  %)  were  encouraged  to  read  specifc  titles  of  e-book  on  recommendations  made  by

search  engines,  while  44  (36.4  %)  read  on  the  
recommendation of teachers. Thirty-four (28.1 %)  
respondents read specifc books on recommendation  
of  their  colleagues.  Thus,  users  rely  on  machine  
(search engines) as well as human support (teachers  
and colleagues) in the selection of e-book titles.  
A  number  of  respondents  reported  multiple  
resources  for  getting  e-books.  Eighty-seven  (71.9  
%)  respondents  were  dependent  on  the  Dr.  B  R.  
Ambedkar  Central  Library  for  getting  e-books,  
while 52 (43.0 %) read e-books that are free of cost.  
Seventy-six (62.7 %) respondents explored Google  
portal  for  e-books.  All  the  respondents  had  read  e-books;  however,  only  three  users  had  ever  purchased  one.  E- books are  more expensive than their print counterparts29.  These fnding were in consonance with observations of Salau30 that students would like to pursue only those e-books of their  interests that are offered free of cost, besides using the ones  provided by their libraries. Respondents were asked to specify  physical  locations  preferred  by  them  for  reading  e-books.  Seventy-nine  (65.3  %)  respondents  accessed  e-books  in  the  library, 64 (52.9 %) in the reading rooms of their respective

6.5   Access  and reading behaviour  for  E-books  
The survey endeavours to understand the evolution  of reading behaviour induced by e-books. Table 6 shows  the different devices used to read e- books. 
Ninety-four  (77.7  %)  respondents  preferred  reading  e-books  on  their  laptops,  while  36  (29.5  %)  took printouts of the portions relevant to their study and  research needs. Such users were fond of reading print  books.  
The  null  hypothesis  H01  states  that  it  is  not  necessary  that  students  who  frequently  visit  library  are also frequent in checking out print books. Both the

parameters are on Ordinal Scale hence, the association between  the  frequency  of  visiting  library  and  frequency  of  checking  out of print books was statistically examined with the Kendall  tau-c test as shown in Table 7. 
The  level  of  signifcance  of  Kendall’s  tau-c  test  value,  expressing  association  in  frequency  of  visiting  the  library  and frequency of checking out of print books, rejects the null  hypothesis. Thus, students who were frequent in library were  also frequent in checking out print books. 
Null hypothesis H02  states that there is no association in  between the frequency of visiting library and the time spent in  exploring e-resources. The association is statistically examined  with the Kendall tau-c test as shown in Table 8. 
The level of signifcance of the Kendall’s tau-c test value,  expressing the association between the frequency of visiting  library  and  the  time  spent  in  exploring  e-resources  failed  to

reject  null  hypothesis  H02.  Thus,  students  who  frequently  visit library need not necessarily devote considerable time in  exploring e-resources; however, null hypothesis H01  indicated  that such students are inclined to checking out print books. 
To test null hypothesis H03, the association between the  frequency of users browsing library website and the time spent  in  exploring  e-resources  was  statistically  examined  with  the  Kendall tau-c test as shown in Table 9. 
The level of signifcance of the Kendall’s tau-c test value,  expressing  association  between  the  frequently  of  browsing  university’s website and the time spent in exploring e-resources  failed to reject null hypothesis H03. It shows that students who  frequently  browse  university  website  need  not  necessarily  devote considerable time in exploring e-resources. 
To test null hypothesis H04, the association between gender  and  time  devoted  in  exploring  e-resources  was  statistically  examined with the Pearson Chi-square test as shown in Table  10. 
The level of signifcance of the Pearson Chi-square test  value  examining  the  association  between  gender  and  time  devoted in exploring e-resources failed to reject null hypothesis  H04. Thus, male and female students do not differ in devoting  time for exploring e-resources. 
7. CoNCLUSIoNS 
The present study gives a snapshot of the perception and  experiences  of  students  and  researchers  with  e-books.  They  perceive a bright and promising future for e-books, and think  that e-books will gain popularity with time.  Library users are  not comfortable with the idea of dropping print books even if  their electronic counterparts are available in library. The print  and e-books will coexist in academic libraries in future. Users  do  not  appreciate  the  idea  of  dependence  on  e-readers  and  availability of the e-books during the subscription period only.  A complete online reading habit is yet to become the norm.  
  The  results  of  this  study  cannot  be  generalised  as  the  survey  is  confned  to  students,  researchers  and  faculty  members  of  one  research  university.  Further  research  needs  to be undertaken with a larger sample of the user population  across  different  learning  and  research  institutions  before  the  fndings could be generalised.  The authors recommend that  similar kind of studies should be undertaken on a regular basis  to understand rapid evolution in users’ perception of e-books.
