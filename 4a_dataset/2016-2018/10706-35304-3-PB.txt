AbSTRACT 
The main aim of this study is to investigate the users’ opinion concerning the use of collection and services  in  the  IARI  library. Therefore,  the  study  is  focused  on  users’  opinion  not  only  in  terms  of  use,  purpose,  and  satisfaction level with the library collection and services, but also in terms of use of e-resources, and adequacy  of library collection. The questionnaire was administered to students of the IARI to collect data regarding the use  of collection and services and analyse the level of users’ satisfaction. The Likert’s scale and chi-square test were  also employed. The survey revealed that there exist signifcant differences not only in the level of usage, purpose,  satisfaction of the library collection and services, but also in terms of use of e-resources and adequacy of library  collection. The researcher observed that the e-form of collection and services due to their high usage has become a  signifcant part of the library in fulflling the needs of the postgraduate and research students. To maximise the use  of library collection and services, the library should consider all the possible aspects related to users satisfaction.  This study highlights the use and non-use of library collection and services, and provides the library management  an opportunity to review its collection and services as well as its policies.  
Keywords: Library collection and services; e-resources, user satisfaction; Indian Agricultural Research Institute 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Agriculture  is  now  not  only  recognised  as  one  of  the  oldest practical arts and the profession in the applied sciences  but also a vital link in the production of the food, shelter, and  clothing  of  mankind.  Food  is  an  indispensable  need  for  the  survival  of  populations.  Therefore,  the  launch  of  First  Five  Year Plan in April 1951 aimed to avoid the food shortage by  the  signifcant  increase  in  the  food  production.  At  present,  agriculture is supporting about 70 per cent of the population  of India1. The national agricultural research system (NARS)  under  the  Indian  council  of  agricultural  research  (ICAR)  consists of 30,000 scientists/teachers in 47 central institutes,  5  national  bureaus,  12  project  directorates,  33  national  research  centres,  91  all  India  coordinated  research  projects,  440  Krishi  Vigyan  Kendras,  120  zonal  agricultural  research  stations, 10 trainers training centres, 44 agriculture technology  information centres, several regional research centres, 40 state  agricultural  universities,  5  deemed  to  be  universities  and  1  central agricultural university2,3. The growth and development  of these organisations and their libraries have made important  contribution in improving the crops production and economic  status. Today, Agricultural University libraries have brought out  substantial changes in their position as well as in the functions,  collections,  services,  etc.  which  has  been  made  possible  by  cutting edge technologies4.

Now, India has a total of 46 agricultural universities, and  their libraries function in different parts of the country5,6. Pt.  Jawaharlal Nehru, the frst Prime Minister of India, laid down  the foundation of green revolution and the real development of  agricultural universities and their libraries begun. Before and  after independence, a large number of agricultural universities  along with their libraries have been established. The Indian  Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) along with its library  was established at Pusa (Bihar), in 1905, which consisted of  5,000  donated  publications.  Due  to  the  devastating  earth- quake, in 1934, the institute was shifted to its present location  in New Delhi, where the library was inaugurated in 1936 by  Lord  Linlithgow,  the  Vice  Roy  and  Governor  General  of  India and named after him as Linlithgow library7. In 1947,  it  was  again  renamed  as  IARI  library8.  The  library  houses  over  6,24,004  highly  specialised  research  publications  on  agriculture and related sciences7. From the above mentioned  available collection, various library services were generated  and used in the study. Therefore, the study seeks the user’s  opinion  concerning  the  use  of  collection  and  services  in  the  IARI  library.  The  fndings  of  this  study  are  expected  to  highlight  the  use  and  non-use  of  library  collection  and  services, and provide the library management, an opportunity  to  review  its  collection  and  services  as  well  as  its  policies  which will help in maximising the use of library collection  and services.

2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
The  era  of  the  technological  revolution,  knowledge  and  information explosion has brought a number of challenges to the  libraries, which have to build an effective hybrid collections and  services for encountering the varied demands of the users. To  understand the use of library collection and services, numerous  studies have been conducted. Ogbomo and Adomi9  showed that  text books was the most used collection in the library, while  in  other  studies,  periodicals  collection  was  the  most  widely  used source by research scholars and agricultural scientists10,11.  Singh12  found the most used information sources as periodicals,  reference  books  and  textbooks.  ocholla13   illustrated  the  use  journals, textbooks, research reports, and conference material.  Majid14, et al.revealed that journal and review articles were the  preferred  primary  information  sources  by  research  scientists.  Uzezi15   and  Salaam 
16 
  revealed  that  all  respondents  used  the  collections for assignments and examination purposes. Fidzani17 found that journals, library books and textbooks were the most  popular sources of information for course work and research,  while the study by Naqvi18  indicated that the library’s collection  such as books, reference materials, research reports, CD-R oMs,  newsletters,  periodicals,  thesis,  book  reviews,  and  seminars/ conference/workshops literature were the most used among the  P.G. students and research scholars for fulflling purposes like  research work, project work, study, and personal work. 
Kumbar and Lohar19  and Shokeen and Kaushik 
20 revealed  that the library catalogue and browsing was the most used way  for locating the documents, respectively, whereas Singh and  Satija21  in their study showed that scientists preferred to use  indexing  and  abstracting  periodicals  for  fnding  the  original  sources. Singh12  indicated that the circulation, photocopy, and  reference  were  the  most  helpful  and  very  popular  services,  while,  many  of  the  users  were  not  aware  about  microflm/ microfche service22. Naqvi18  showed that the library services  like  photocopying,  CD-RoM  database,  online,  catalogue,  indexing  and  abstracting,  CAS,  bibliographical,  reference,  and  lending/circulation  were  the  most  used  among  the  P.G.  students and research scholars. In other studies, reference and  circulation  services23,  and  reprographic  service24   were  found  satisfactory.   
The  adequacy  of  library  collections  is  one  of  the  signifcant elements in determining the success of any library.  Majid  and  Tan25   indicated  printed  materials  such  as  books  were  the  most  preferred  information  format  and    the  use  of  databases  and  electronic  journals  was  quite  low.  Naqvi26,27 in  his  studies  revealed  that  the  CD-RoM  databases  such  as  AGRIS, AGRICOLA, CAB abstract, and agriculture & natural  resources; and e-journals were the highly used e-resources by  the majority of P.G. students and research scholars of GBPUAT.  Singh and Singh10  and Ikhizama and Oduwole 
11 
 investigated  the library collection as adequate and fair respectively, while  tMajid and Kassim28  showed that respondents perceived IIUM  library collections, services and facilities as adequate to meet  their information needs effectively.   
Kiran29  found that the overall satisfaction with the library  services received a satisfactory rating and  the library assessment  helped to know the  current library strengths and weaknesses30 that can provide an opportunity to libraries in re-orienting their  
426 
collections, services and activities for effectively meeting their  information needs17,31.  
3. ObJECTIVES AND  LIMITATIONS 
The present study aimed to explore the use of collection  and  services  of  IARI  library  by  the  students. Therefore,  the  following  objectives  were  set  to  attain  the  main  aim  of  the  study: 
i.     To  fnd  out  the  use  of  various  categories  of  library  
collections and services among the students. 
ii.     To  identify  the  purpose  of  use  of  various  categories  of  
library collections and services.  
iii.     To  know  the  types  of  e-resources  most  used  by  the  
students. 
iv.     To  fnd  out  the  adequacy  of  various  types  of  print  and  
electronic collection in the library.  
v.     To assess the students’ satisfaction in using the various  
categories of library collections and services. 
Under this study, personal characteristics such as gender  and age have not been considered and only the users’ approach  (post graduate students and research scholars) to know the use  of library collection and services has been questioned. 
3.1 Hypotheses  
H1: There exists signifcant difference in usage, purpose,  and  satisfaction  level  in  using  various  types  of  library  collections and services.  
H2:  There  exists  signifcant  difference  in  the  use  of  e-resources. 
H3:  There  exists  signifcant  difference  in  the  level  of  adequacy of library collection. 
4. RESEARCH  METHODOLOGY 
Due to its self-administered nature, inexpensiveness, and  usefulness, the most prominent survey approach was applied in  this study32. In the light of set objectives and literature review,  a  questionnaire  containing  several  close-ended,  open-ended,  and  multiple  choice  questions  was  designed  to  collect  the  relevant  research  data.  Likert’s  fve-point  scale  in  designing  the questionnaire was also used.  
The  questionnaires  were  randomly  distributed  to  250  post-graduate  (P.G.)  students  and  research  scholars  studying  in  IARI,  India.    130  (52  %)  flled  in  questionnaires  were  returned. Finally, 125 (50 %) total useable questionnaires were  selected as sample size for data analysis and interpretation. The  demographic data is as follows in Table 1. 
The  collected  data  from  the  students  was  organised,  tabulated, analysed and interpreted using the following tools  and techniques: frequency distribution, percentages, summated  mean scores through weighted index and ranking techniques;  MS-excel Package; and the chi-square test. 
5. RESULTS AND  ANALYSIS  
The collected data was analysed and interpreted to draw  the results and testing of hypotheses framed for this study. 
5.1 Use  of  Collections  and  Services 
In  this  study,  the  whole  collection  and  services  was

classifed into the several information sources and services to  have a clear picture of usage by the P.G. students and research  scholars.  
Table 2 indicated the usage of several information sources  through mean and ranking. The following information sources  such  as  CD-RoMs,  reference  materials,  books/monographs,  periodicals,  thesis/dissertations,  research  reports/bulletins,  seminars/conference/workshops proceedings, and newsletters  were  heavily  used  among  the  majority  of  P.G.  students  and  research scholars. It was also revealed that other information  sources  such  as  microfches/records/tapes,  standards/patents/ specifcations,  reprints/maps/globes,  and  book  reviews  were  very least used among P.G. students and research scholars.  
Similarly, it was also noted from Table 3 that most of the  P.G. students and research scholars used CD-RoM database  service,  photocopy  service,  library  catalogue  for  locating  the  documents,    reference  services  for  getting  the  original  information source, lending/circulation service for borrowing  books/monographs,  online  services,  bibliographical  service,  
and indexing & abstracting (I&A) service, respectively. The  services like Inter-library loan (ILL) service, microflm service,  document  delivery  service  (DDS),  and  current  awareness  service (CAS) were very least used among the P.G. students  and research scholars. 
It  was  found  from  Tables  2  and  3,  that  there  existed  signifcant  differences  in  the  usage  of  various  types  of  library  collection  and  services  among  the  students.  Hence,  the  hypothesis  ‘There  exists  signifcant  difference  in  usage,  purpose, and satisfaction level in using various types of library  collections and services’ was partially validated by the above  fndings. 
5.2 Purpose  of  use  of  Collections  and  Services 
Under study, out of fve purposes ; research work, project  work, study, personal work, and no response, the P.G. students  and research scholars were asked to state one or more than one  in  order  to  ascertain  the  purpose  of  using  different  types  of  library collection and services. 
Table 2 revealed that most of the P.G. students and research  scholars made use of CD-RoMs, reference materials, research  reports/bulletins,  periodicals,  thesis/dissertations,  books/ monographs, seminars/conference/workshops proceedings, and  newsletters to fulfl their different purposes such as research  work,  project  work,  study,  and  personal  work.  In  addition,  the sources like microfches/ records/tapes, standards/patents/ specifcations,  book  reviews, and  reprints/maps/globes  were  least used information sources among P.G. students compared  to research scholars for their various purposes.

photocopy,  catalogue,  lending/circulation,  and  DDS  were  heavily used library services among majority of P.G. students  and research scholars for their different purposes. The other  library services such as ILL, Microflm, and CAS were very  least  used  services  among  the  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars for their various purposes.  
The  results  from  Table  2  and  3  indicated  that  the  chi- square table value was greater than the chi-square calculated  value and there exists signifcant difference in the purpose of  use of library collection and services among students. Thus,  the hypothesis was confrmed by the above fndings. 
5.3 Satisfaction  Level  in  using  of  Collections  and  
Services 
To know the overall effectiveness of the library collection  and services, P.G. students and research scholars were asked to  provide their satisfaction assessment with regards to available  collection and services in meeting their information needs. 
According to the mean score and ranking from Table 2,  most of the P.G. students and research scholars were highly  satisfed  with  the  usage  of  CD-RoMs,  reference  materials,  books/monographs,  thesis/dissertations,  periodicals,  research  reports/bulletins, seminars/conference/workshops proceedings,  and newsletters. It was also observed that the P.G. students as  compared  to  research  scholars  were  least  satisfed  with  the  usage of sources like microfches/ records/tapes, reprints/maps/ globes,  standards/patents/specifcations,  and  book  reviews  respectively.  
In this study, Table 3 illustrated that the P.G. students and  research scholars were highly satisfed with the services like  photocopy,  CD-RoM  database,  reference,  bibliographical,

lending/circulation,  catalogue,  I&A,  online,  and  CAS.  In  addition,  the  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars  were  least  satisfed with the services such as microflm, ILL, and DDS,  respectively.  
In comparison, the results from Table 2 and 3 revealed  that  the  chi-square  calculated  value  was  far  less  than  the  chi-square  table  value  and  the  signifcant  difference  in  the  satisfaction level in using the collections and services among  students  existed. Accordingly,  the  hypothesis  was  confrmed  by the above fndings. 
5.4 Use  of  E-resources  Collections 
This section deals with e-resources which are mushrooming  in Agriculture libraries and very popular among the users in  comparison to print sources. To know the usage of e-resources  collection,  the  whole  collection  has  been  categorised  as  mentioned in Table 4. 
The mean use score and ranking indicated that CD-RoM  databases,  e-journals,  and  online  databases  were  the  highly  used databases among most of the P.G. students and research  scholars.  
The library from publishing companies around the world  subscribed to a number of international prominent electronic  and online databases in Agriculture and other related subjects  for searching the latest world of research literature.  
According  to  mean  use  frequency  score  and  ranking  of  CD-RoM  databases  from  Table  5,  AGRIS,  CAb abstract,  AGRICOLA,  Agriculture  &  natural  resources  and  biotechnology  were  the  highly  used  CD-RoM  databases  among the P.G. students and research scholars.

In the analysis, it was noticed from Tables 4 and 5 that  the  chi-square  calculated  value  is  lesser  than  the  chi-square  table value. Therefore, the hypothesis ‘There exists signifcant  difference  in  the  use  of  e-resources’  was  confrmed  by  the  results of the study. 
5.5 Adequateness  of  Collection 
It  was  observed  from  Table  6  that  P.G.  students  and  research scholars of IARI were satisfed with the adequateness  of the print collection rather than electronic.  
Accordingly,  the  result  demonstrated  that  there  existed  signifcant differences in terms of adequacy of library collection  as the chi-square calculated value was less than the chi-square  table value. It was also noticed that the print collection was  playing  a  vital  role  in  satisfying  the  needs  of  the  student  community.  Hence,  the  hypothesis  ‘There  exists  signifcant  difference in the level of adequacy of library collection’ was  verifed by the above outcomes. 
Finally,  it  was  indicated  that  all  three  hypotheses  were  validated by the results of Table 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

6.  CONCLUSIONS 
The major results of the research showed that there exist  signifcant differences not only in the level of usage, purpose,  satisfaction of the library collection and services, but also in  terms of use of e-resources and adequacy of library collection.  This signifcant difference will not only assist in reviewing and  strengthening the collections and services but also in meeting  the need of P.G. students and research scholars.   
Apart  from  this,  the  study  also  revealed  that  the  information sources such as CD-RoMs, reference materials,  books/monographs,  periodicals,  thesis/dissertations,  research  reports/bulletins, seminars/conference/workshops proceedings,  and newsletters were heavily used among the majority of P.G.  students  and  research  scholars  for  their  different  purposes  (research  work,  project  work,  study,  and  personal  work).  Moreover,  the  library  services  such  as  CD-RoM  database,  photocopy,  library  catalogue,  reference,  lending/circulation,  online, bibliographical, and I&A were the most used services  among the P.G. students and research scholars. It was observed  that CD-RoM databases, e-journals and online databases were  the highly used e-resources among the P.G. students and research  scholars.  In  addition,  CAB  abstract,  AGRIS,  AGRICOLA,  agriculture & natural resources, and biotechnology were the  most  used  specifc  electronic  and  online  databases  among  the P.G. students and research scholars. The e-form of library  collection and services due to their high usage has become a  signifcant part of the agricultural university library in satisfying  the demands of the student community. To take advantage of  recent developments in science & technology and information  revolution, the library is playing a vital role in transmitting the  scientifc and technological knowledge to the users by building  a good collection of knowledge not only in print but also in  electronic format in agriculture and related felds.  
The  study  has  highlighted  some  negative  impacts  or  drawbacks  such  as  inadequacies,  and  use  and  non-use  of  collection  and  services,  to  ascertain  areas  which  require  improvements.  Therefore,  a  number  of  recommendations  suggested  for  making  the  collection  and  services  effective  as  the  library  collection  and  services  must  be  user  centered  and  improved:  the  library  collection  for  optimal  utilisation  should be kept up-to-date by adding the latest/revised editions/ volumes of the most frequently used information sources and  by weeding out obsolete information sources. The number of  copies of most demanded/utilised books must be acquired and

one copy be placed in the reserve collection so that more users  can use them at the same time; research reports and conference/ seminars/workshops  proceedings  from  reputed  national  and  international agricultural organisations should be obtained to  keep the user community aware of the latest research trends;  the  collections  such  as  microfches/records/tapes,  standards/ patents/specifcations,  and  reprints/maps/globes  and  services  such as microflm, ILL, and DDS should be strengthened for  effective  utilisation;  more  number  of  e-resources  should  be  subscribed  and  appropriate  number  of  networked  computers  for effective searching and browsing be installed; networking  among all the agricultural libraries at national and international  level for effective utilisation of collection and services needs to  be developed; to enhance the use of print and e-resources, the  library awareness campaigns concerning the latest promotion  methods such as circulation of new arrivals list though e-mail,  e-mail alert/pop up system, text messages, workshops, prizes,  etc. must be accelerated;  and librarians and library staff need to  improve their knowledge and skills by attending more training  programs on effective searching and retrieval in order to train its  users more effectively, and for optimum utilisation of available  information  resources,  the  library  must  provide  orientation  assistance  to  the  users  and  compulsory  user  education  or  information  literacy  programs  must  be  implemented.  In  order to maximize the use of library collection and services,  the  library  should  consider  all  the  possible  aspects  related  to  users  satisfaction.  Further,  this  study  provides  the  library  higher management an opportunity to review its collection and  services as well as its policies so that utilisation of used and  no-used collection and services could be enhanced.
