Transparency and accountability, participation and services are some of the important priorities of governments  across the word today. Information plays an essential role in achieving all there objectives which is largely being  delivered by using websites. Study of these websites entails the role of governments in disseminating information  and  providing  services  to  the  user  community. The  current  study  uses  6  key  parameters  with  55  indicators  to  evaluate the performance of 81 central government ministries and departments. It is found that all the websites are  following guidelines related to identifer with utmost importance, where as the scores in information, usability and  security parameters are quite acceptable. It is also found that the score with respect to participation and services  it is very low. Correlation analysis shows strong relationship between information and usability and usability and  participation. The study also observes that most of the websites mostly facebook or tweeter for social networking.  The information facilitation index shows that Ministry of External Affairs has the highest score of 0.875 and the  lowest score lies with Department of Agricultural Research and Education. Though information is being delivered  through the websites can be accessed with little efforts, the concern is that when it comes to citizen participation  
and service delivery there is quite a lot to be improved.

1. IntroductIon 
Governments  across  the  world  make  information  available through different channels to citizens to create a level  of transparency, to represent accountability and to bring to the  attention  of  the  general  public  their  achievements.  Citizens  use this information to make decisions regarding the level of  confdence and accomplishment of governments. Besides, such  information empowers the citizens to make choices in addition  to making them aware of the progress made in different areas.  Government information such as acts, policies and schemes are  of immense importance to citizens. The real objectives of these  policies and schemes are achieved only when the associated  benefts  reach  down  to  the  masses.  With  the  development  of  World  Wide  Web,  governments  are  able  to  harness  the  rich  potential  of  the  web,  and  reach  to  the  citizens.  On  the  other  hand  citizens  also  have  a  ready  access  to  government  information available on the websites of different Ministries  and  departments.  With  many  citizen-centric  e-governance  initiatives thousands of services are delivered at the doorstep.  
India has been always a front runner in adopting technology  in governance. Since the beginning with an active support from  National Informatics Centre many ministries and departments  have  been  providing  information  and  services  to  citizens.  Government both at central and state level are actively engaged  in  building  e-governance  platforms  for  the  citizens.  From

time to time the government of India has also framed many  policies as a part of facilitating e-governance. A major policy  formulated in the form of Information Technology Act 2000  happens to be a landmark development in IT policy in India. In  the year 2005 the right to information became reality with an  emphasis on a proactive disclosure of vital information on the  web or any other medium to facilitate information access. The  11th  report of the second Administrative Reforms Commission  focused  exclusively  on  e-governance.  Recently,  the  digital  India initiative focuses not only on providing information and  services through an e-governance platform but also to make it  available to the citizens across the country.  
United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  conducts  global  surveys  on  e-governance  and  constructs  an  e-governance  development  index  biannually.  Though  many  efforts  being  made  by  the  central  and  state  governments  in  India,  the  e-governance  development  index  score  has  not  shown much improvement. It has been in the range of .37 to  .40 across various rounds of surveys. In fact,  the EGDI of India  has gone down from a high of 86, in 2004 to 125, in 2012, but  has improved to 107 as per the latest round of surveys released  in 2016. This indicates that the e-governance development is  quite progressive in many other countries. However, the only  thing to cheer about is the e-participation index which has seen  considerable improvement and India, currently ranked at 27.  The online services index has also seen signifcant improvement  in the latest round of survey as shown in Table 1.

A  major  problem  involved  in  providing  e-governance  services  in  the  Indian  context  is  the  presence  of  a  poor  telecommunication  infrastructure  which  is  the  back  bone  of  the  e-governance,  especially  in  the  rural  areas  where  internet penetration is very low. However, with setting up of  community information centres across all the states, accessing  various government information and services through different  website and portals developed for these services has become a  reality even in the remote areas. 
In the Government of India directory there are listing of  51 ministries, 2 independent departments, and 54 departments.  These  are  the  websites  through  which  Government  of  India  facilitates  the  dissemination  of  information  to  citizens  with  many  of  these  websites  exists  since  long.  Studying  these  websites  will  allow  us  to  understand  how  the  information  dissemination is being facilitated.  
2. LIterAture revIeW 
Through  websites,  industry,  government,  educational  institutions  communicate  with  their  respective  clients.  Given the importance of websites since the beginning many  general  as  well  as  sector  specifc  i.e.  e-commerce  websites,  universities  or  various  government  websites  were  studied  to  evaluate  their  effciency  and  effectiveness.  Considering  that  information  seekers  or  the  users  of  these  websites  are  different, it is largely sector specifc website evaluation where  most of the researches are being done. Also, key evaluation  indicators differ a lot from sector to sector. While examining  the evaluation studies of government websites it is observed  that there exist studies which are multi country comparisons,  within  the  country  comparisons  at  various  level  i.e.  central,  state and local levels and also, there are many studies which  focus  largely  on  local  government  or  municipality websites.  Panopoulou1 , et al. Using general characteristics, e-content,  e-services,  e-participation  framework  analysed  the  Greek  government websites at all the level i.e. national, provincial  and  municipalities’  level  and  observe  that  the  general  characteristics and e-contents scores are comparatively better  where as e-services and e-participation it is very low. Lee2, et  al. Korean e-government services are fairly attainable but it  takes too many steps and long time to complete the process.  Sanabria3, et al. Interaction and integration framework based  study  of  three latin American  states  shows  that  Brazil  and  Chile  moving  more  rapidly  towards  more  complex  ways  of  
interaction  and  integration,  whereas  Colombia  citizen

compared to Bangladesh, India and Singapore. most of  
the studies includes both technical and content oriented so  
as to highlight various issues related to accessibility and  
content delivery. However as the primary aim of the website is  
to delivery information content or the information are part of  
almost all the studies.  
Websites  of  central,  state  and  local  governments  in  
India  were  studied  by  many  researchers  from  time  to  time  
for  accessibility,  usability,  content  and  service  delivery.  
Khatre 6, et al.  Studies shows that usability of state government  
websites  are  very  low  and  needs  signifcant  improvement  
whereas  webometric,    Walia7,  et  al.  study  of  ministries  of  
central government websites shows wide variance in their web  
impact factors. 
The conceptual framework of these studies differs widely.  
Many of the study concentrate largely on the accessibility and  
related issues where as others studies evaluates deep down to  
features such as online services and citizen participation. The  
collection  of  data  also  varies  widely  from  grounded  theory  
approach to heuristic evaluation and to observation. 
3.   o bjectIveS 
(i) To study information dissemination through websites by  
different central government ministries and departments. (ii) To  evaluate  the  usability  of  websites  run  by  different  
central government ministries and departments. (iii) To understand the relationship between various parameters  
of the websites. 
(iv) To assess the use of Social Networking tools by different  
central government ministries and departments. (v) To develop an information facilitation index. 
4. MethodoLoGy 
Keeping  in  view  the  above  conceptual  framework,  we  have  considered  six  broad  key  parameters  for  the  study  i.e.  identifer,  information,  usability,  security,  participation  and  services.  Identifer  is  the  concept  which  confrms  the  authenticity of websites and certifes the credibility which is  very important from the user point of view to determine the  accuracy and dependability. Information or content is the second  major  parameter  which  actually  defnes  the  key  information  that  is  being  disseminated.  Information  made  available  for  the  consumption  to  the  perspective  users  are  part  of  this  parameter. Usability is considered to be the user friendliness  of  the  websites  which  determines  the  ease  of  use  and  other  accessibility characteristics. Security and privacy confrms the  sense of being protected from risks and vulnerability on the

other hand participation is the engagement of government and  the public across various platforms being linked through the  websites. Lastly service delivery through the websites make  the  citizens  access  the  platforms  developed  for  a  quick  and  easy service delivery. These parameters are further subdivided  into 55 indicators as mentioned in the Table 2 for evaluating  the websites. 
While  navigating  websites  of  central  government  ministries/departments,  it  was  observed  that  many  websites  attached to the parent website such as Department of Higher  Education  and  Department  of  Elementary  Education  being  part of Ministry of Human Resource Development websites.  Likewise many departments under Ministry of Home Affairs  and Ministry of Finance do not have separate websites. Few  ministries  do  not  have  their  own  websites  but  departments  under  the  ministry  have  their  independent  websites.  After  careful evaluation we have considered 81 government websites  attached  to  41  ministries  and  40  departments  for  detailed  analysis. The data collected was dichotomous only. The data  was collected between March-April 2016. Using MS Excel the  data was analysed and presented as shown in Table 2, using  descriptive statistics.

5.1 Analysis  of  Scores  of  under different  
Parameters 
As  explained  earlier  the  study  considered  55  indicators  classifed under six parameters for the study. Tables 3 and 4  explain  how  websites  have  performed  with  respect  to  each  of  the  different  parameters.  Identifer  has  4  parameters  and  all  the  websites  strictly  follow  the  guidelines  related  to  the  identifers. It is a good sign which determines the authenticity  of the website and helps the users easily establish legitimacy  from the home page itself. But when we consider information  parameter  which  has  19  indicators  the  scores  varies  widely  from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 18 with a mean score  of 13.48. The standard deviation for information parameter is  2.419. None of the websites has recorded presence in all the

information parameter. The usability scores vary between 7 and  15 out of 15 indicators. The mean usability score is 12.35 and  standard deviation is 1.590. Scores under security and privacy  parameter varies between 1 and 5 with a mean score of 3.04.  When we look at the participation and services parameters the  scores varies between 0-8 and 0-3 respectively. The important  thing to notice here is that there are websites where none of  these features were available. The mean scores are also very  low at 2.35 and 0.54 for participation and services respectively.  Many  of  the  websites  are  very  informative  and  having  high  usability scores but the participation and services features in  these websites are very minimal. 
The  percentage  score  of  each  parameter  presents  more  clarity  on  their  performance. As  we  have  mentioned  earlier  for identifer parameter it is 4 out of 4, and is 100 % for all  the  websites  under  study.  When  we  study  the  information  parameter we can observe that 13 websites of ministries and  departments have a score of > 80 % where as 33 websites under  study have scores between 70-79 % which is a very good score  over all. There are 5 websites with a very low score of < 50  %. But the usability score of 62 websites are more than 80 %  which signifes that these websites are easy to use. 53 websites  have  recorded  a  score  of  60-69  %  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy indicators whereas for 15 websites it happens to be less  than 50 % which is a concern. But in respect of participation  and  services  parameters  the  performance  is  very  poor  with  75 and 68 websites under the study recording scores of less  than 50 % which means the scope for citizen engagement is  comparatively  very  poor  vis-a-vis  information  and  usability  of these websites. Overall 5 websites have registered a total  score  of  more  than  80  %,  certainly  these  websites  provide  more information to the user community and which is easily  accessible  and  engage  citizens  more  effectively. Another  17

websites scored between 70-79 % which is considerable high  score. But half of the websites recorded scores between 60-69  % which signifes these websites can be enhanced and enriched  further in different aspects to provide rich user experience both  in terms for content as well as services. However, 17 websites  have recorded a score of 50-59 % and 2 websites have very poor  scores of less than 50 % and these websites needs signifcant  improvement. 
From the Fig. 1 mentioned can clearly observe that in  respect of identifer, information and usability the scores are  comparatively higher where as the scores are very poor in  the case of participation and services. When we look at the  total score most of the websites exhibit a score of more than  60 %. 
Figure 1. Percentage scores across parameters. 
5.2   c orrelation  between different  Parameters 
It  is  quite  important  to  examine  here  the  relationship  between these variables and how signifcant these relationships  are. As the indicator variable is constant across sample it was  ignored for the correlation analysis and rest of the indicators  were  considered  for  correlation  analysis.  Using  Pearson  correlation  we  analysed  the  relationship  between  these  variables  which  is  presented  in  Table  5.  We  can  observe  a  strong  relationship  between  information  and  usability  and  usability and participation and is found to be signifcant at 0.01  level. Correlation between information with participation and  services is found signifcant at 0.05 levels. Also from the test  we observe a negative relationship between participation and  services and the relationship is found very week. 
5.3   u se  of  Social networking tools  by  Government  
Websites 
Social media is one of the important communication tools  for citizen participation and digital inclusiveness. Governments  across the world use these tools to reach to the large user base.  Also, the simplicity of these tools makes it easy for users to use  and to visit frequently. There has been a very high penetration

of  many  globally  active  social  networking  sites  in  India.  Although the central government ministries/departments also  have adopted these new features there is a lot more to be done.  From the Table 6 given that we can observe that Facebook and  Twitter are the two most popular social networking websites  used by Government of India websites to the extent of 49% and  51%,  respectively,  followed  by youTube  with  21%.  But  the  rest of the other social networking sties have a very minimal  presence. 
5.4   t op  and bottom  5  Government Websites 
While studying the performance of websites at the level  of ministries and departments (individual unit) level we can  observe (from Table 7) that it is Ministry of External Affairs  
which is outstanding in terms of achieving a  top score of  
46  with  83.64  %.  However  it  is  noteworthy  to  mention  
here it could be largely because of good participation score  
MEA could able to achieve the top rank where as it’s score  
in two important parameters i.e information and usability  
is comparatively lower. The department of Biotechnology  
has  come  out  with  a  total  score  of  45  and  is  ranked  2.  
There are three ministries with a score of 44 each and all  
of them are ranked 3rd, but the Ministry of Commerce and  
Department of Personnel and Training has achieved high  
score in Information parameter i.e. 18 where as in the case  of Ministry of Corporate Affairs security is found to be a very  strong feature.

6. InForMAtIon  FAcILItAtIon  Index 
An  index  was  constructed  to  rank  the  ministries/ departments based score obtained by the respective websites.  In  the  absence  of  predefned  weights  we  use  a  principal  component analysis to determine the relative weights of each  parameter. Also as one of the parameter i.e. identifer has an  equal score for all the units the parameter was not considered  while determining the weights and index. In the frst step the  values  of  the  rest  fve  indicators  were  normalised  using  the  formula, normalised value = (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x). The  objective of normalisation was to bring all the data on a 0 and  1 scale. The normalised data was then transferred to SPSS for  obtaining the eigine values and rotated matrix components for  calculating weights. By multiplying eigine values and rotated  matrix component the relative weights of each parameter was  calculated. The weights are then multiplied with the normalised  value and divided by the total weights to obtain the index score  which is mentioned in Appendix ‘A’. 
From the Table 8 we can observe that Ministry of External  Affairs has achieved the highest information facilitation index  (IfI) score of 0.8752 where as department of Biotechnology  is second with an IFI score of 0.7523 which is less by almost  15 per cent. Department of Personnel and Training, Ministry  of Corporate Affairs and Department of Commerce have IFI  scores of 0.7356, 0.7234 and 0.7219 securing 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank respectively although their total score in terms of different  characteristics is 44 each. Likewise Ministry of Parliamentary  Affairs, Ministry of Earth Sciences and Department of Health  research have achieved score of 0.2771, 0.2674, and 0.2390  respectively  securing  77th,  78th,  and  79th   rank  respectively  though their total score in terms of different characteristics is  28 each. Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Ministry  of  Urban  Development  have  same  IFI  score  of  0.5007  both  ranked at 35, likewise Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry  of Labour and Employment have same score of 0.3536 with a  common rank of 52. At rank 65 also there are two departments  i.e.  Department  of  Youth  Affairs  and  Department  of  Space  with a common score of 0.3536. Department of Agricultural

Accountability  and  governance  are  key  features  of  progressive governments. E-governance is the powerful tool  which governments use to deliver information and services to  be more accountable and provide corruption free governance. It  is very important that the governments should deliver credible  information services to its citizen and there is no better channel  than websites. Identifying the credibility of Indian government  websites is very impressive and most of the websites follow  the standard strictly. Information and Usability indicators of  the Government of India websites are much appreciable. Most  of  the  information  are  being  delivered  through  the  websites  which  can  be  accessed  with  little  efforts.  But  the  biggest  concern  is  that  when  it  comes  to  citizen  participation  and  service delivery there is quite a lot to be improved. There might  be  many  services  delivered  by  these  Ministries/Departments  through other portals but the linking is missing which might  not  help  the  citizens.  Use  of  social  networking  tools  should  be given preference to reach to wider audience and for citizen  engagement.
