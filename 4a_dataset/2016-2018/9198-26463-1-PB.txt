Scientifc  progress  in  a  domain  depends  greatly  on  making  use  of  results  of  previous  research  activities.  Like  human  beings,  it  is  diffcult  for  computers  to  encode  and  retrieve  the  expanding  web  information. The basic answer to this problem is to describe the information explicitly and semantically  with ontology. The article presents a brief discussion of the study undertaken to design an ontology for  Nanotechnology, which was developed by using the Resource Description Framework (RDF).  This paper  further describes methodology opted to develop the Nanotechnology ontology, where a semantic structure  of Nanotechnology thesaurus was utilised for its creation. The study has further presented the features of  nMap software, which was developed specifcally for the study by using VB.net as front-end tool and MS- access as back-end tool. Outcome of the study offers a semantic knowledge structure to Nanotechnology  researchers in machine readable environment. Further, development of ontology in RDF format serves  interoperability and will further support semantic interpretation by machines to facilitate human understanding.

1.  INtrODUctION 
The web is a techno-social system through which  interlinked  and  hypertext  documents  are  accessed  through  internet1.  It  was  created  with  an  aim  to  enable  anybody,  anywhere,  anytime  to  retrieve  information.  Sir  Tim  Berners-Lee  was  the  one  who  created  world’s  first  website  in  19912.  Since  1991,  there appeared an immense progress in the manner  
like  web  1.0,  web  2.0  and  web  3.01,3,4,5,6 .  
such  that  not  only  documents  are  linked  together  
also be recognised6. Semantic web is considered as  
controlled vocabulary tool, it is essential to establish  whether such tools exist for the domain or not8. To  investigate the existence of related works, a check  in the literature particularly current and back issues  of ‘Knowledge Organisation’, a quarterly publication  of ‘International Society for Knowledge Organisation’  (ISKO)  as  was  suggested  by Aitchison,  Gilchrist  &  Bawden9   was  undertaken.  With  the  analysis  of  the  
in  which  information  is  published  and  accessed  on  
publication,  it  was  established  that  work  related  the web.  On the basis of characteristics and features

Similarly,  Biasiotti  &  Tiscornia11  represented legal concepts in ontological framework  to  support  understanding,  re-use  and  sharing  of  knowledge  in  legal  domain.  Some  other  studies  reflected the development of ontology in various other  disciplines. Esbjorn-Hargens25  proposed an ontology  on climate change. A study by Gokhale, Deokattey &  Bhanumurthy26  reported methodology for constructing  sample domain ontology on energy amplifiers. As a  source for keywords, INIS database was employed  in  the  study.  In  the  same  year,  Thomas,  Pappu  &  Baker27  reported the designing and development of  
knowledge  in  a  conceptual  manner.  
• Explicit:  means  that  the  type  of  concepts  used  
and  the  constraints  on  their  use  are  clearly  
defined. 
• Formal:  domain  knowledge  encompassed  in

• Shared:  ontology  construction  should  be  in  
shared  agreement.

More precisely, ontology is a conceptual and machine

3.  ObJEct IVES AND  ScOPE 
Keeping in view the need of the hour, the present  study  deals  with  the  overview  of  Nanotechnology  and  designing  an  ontology,  which  consists  of  a  semantic  framework  of  Nanotechnology  concepts  that  can  be  inferred  explicitly  both  by  machines  and  humans.  
Scope of concepts of Nanotechnology ontology  is limited to Physical Sciences in depth and touches  other  associated  areas  in  broader  sense.  
4.  ONtOLOGY 
The term ‘ontology’ is frequently appearing in texts.   There  exist  several  definitions  for  ontology: • In  Philosophy  perspective,  ‘Ontology  is  the  
study  of  kind  of  things  that  exists’8. 
• 
4.1  Ontology  components  
Nguyen  &  Le-Thanh13   listed  following  principal  components  of  ontology: 
• Classes:  represent  a  set  of  entities  within  a  
domain  (general  things). 
• Individuals/Instances:  indicate  the  concrete  
example of concepts within the domain (individual  
things). 
• Attributes: properties those concepts/things may  
have. 
• Relations:  specify  the  interaction  among  
concepts. 
• Axioms: assertions including rules in a logical form  
(imposing  restrictions  on  establishing  relations  
between  concepts).

Further, Guarino, Oberle & Staab11  cited Studer,  Benjamins  &  Fensel12   to  state  that  ontology  is  
information in a meaningful manner.  Thus, semantic  web  is  an  attempt  to  provide  extension  to  current  web  where  information  is  meaningfully  defined,

This definition includes following characteristics  of  ontology:    
• Conceptualisation: ontology represents domain  
‘a  formal,  explicit  specification  of  a  shared processed  with  the  help  of  machines,  and  people work  in  collaboration.  The  work  of  transforming  
web  to  semantic  web  can  be  carried  out  with  the  help of ontologies. Ontologies provide a structured  framework for domain concepts, organise concepts  in  hierarchical  and  associative  association  that

permits  reasoning  for  knowledge.  
Ontologies which are considered as core component  of  Semantic  web  serve  following  purposes: • In  comparison  to  other  member  tools  of  
controlled  vocabulary,  ontologies  offer  more  
enriched relationship between domain concepts  
and  are  appropriate  to  support  rich  structured  
knowledge. 
• Offer provision to define metadata about resources  
which  allow  machines  and  human  users  to  
recognise,  gather,  process,  and  share  relevant  
information  semantically. 
• Show  integration  of  information  from  various  
to move in material. This is due to the fact that  
shrinking of bulk structure to nanoscale resulted  
in  increase  of  band-gaps.  This  quantum  effect  
results  in  altering  the  electronic  and  optical  
properties  of  materials. 
(iii) Random Molecular Motion: At macro level, size  
of  object  is  comparatively  large  in  comparison  
to  the  kinetic  energy  of  molecules.  Thus,  the  
motion  of  molecules  is  not  influential  on  how  
an  object  moves.  But,  at  nanoscale,  molecular  
motion is comparable to the size of the particle  
and  thus  has  great  impact  on  how  particle  
behaves.

5.  OVEr VIEW  OF  NANO tEcHNOLOGY 
The concept ‘Nanotechnology’ is a combination  of  two  sub-concepts,  i.e.,  ‘nano’  and  ‘technology’. 
The  prefix  ‘nano’  was  derived  from  the  Greek  word dwarf, which has been used since 1960 in the  metric system14. In scientific context, the scale ‘nano’  represents 10-9 where one nanometer is equivalent  to  one  thousandth  of  a  micrometer,  one  millionth  of  a  millimeter,  and  one  billionth  of  a  meter.  It  is  the  size  where  most  of  the  fundamental  chemical,  physical, electrical properties of materials matched  with  those  experienced  at  atomic  and  molecular  scale  like  quantum  effect,  wave  particle  duality,  etc.17.  Further,  describing  the  nature  of  properties  at  nanoscale,  it  was  unanimously  accepted  that  laws  of  Physics  at  nanoscale  are  governed  both  by  classical  as  well  as  quantum  mechanics 19,20,21.  
The  second  component  of  Nanotechnology,  
Nanotechnology  is  considered  as  one  of  the  most  revolutionary  technology  that  has  touched  almost  every  aspect  of  mankind.  It  has  promised  great  future  for  diverse  areas.  Some  of  them  are  listed  here  as  under: 
(a) Agriculture: Nanotechnology helps in enhancing the  
crop productivity by imparting genetic improvement  
in  crops. 
(b) Electronics  and  Communication:  Cost  effective  
and  capable  modes  for  recording  of  data,  flat  
panel display, wireless communication technology,  
etc.,  are  all  due  to  the  overwhelming  research  
efforts  in  Nanotechnology. 
(c) Energy: Nanotechnology reduces dependency of  
mankind  on  fossil  fuels  by  offering  renewable  
energy  solutions.  It  also  proposes  affordable  
and efficient energy storage and saving device  
like  light  emitting  diodes  (LEDS),  etc. 
(d) Machines: Overwhelming properties and prospects  
of nanoscale machines and engines offers notable  
benefits  in  terms  of  sustainable  development,  
efficient  working  and  energy  saving. 
science into practical use to develop structures and  tools  that  can  solve  the  problems  of  the  society.  It  holds  true  for  Nanotechnology  also  as  it  is  the  technology  at  nanoscale  having  applications  in  the  development  of  society.

7. ONtOLOGY  ENGINEErING 
Ontology engineering refers to various approaches,  tools,  and  languages  involved  in  building  ontology.   For  ontology  engineering  Malik,  Prakash  &  Rizvi35 cited Denny36  to elaborate following basic steps for  ontology  modelling: 
• Attaining deep insight of the discipline in which  
domain  ontology  is  to  build 
• Identification  of  concepts  that  represents  the  
domain  selected  for  ontology 
• Creation  of  hierarchical  structure  by  creating  
classes,  and  their  respective  subclasses • Defining  properties  to  establish  relationships  
between  the  concepts 
• Verification  of  constructed  ontology  for  
consistency  
• Deployment of ontology for transfer and sharing of  
information  in  machine  readable  environment 
Steps  for  ontology  creation  can  further  be  denoted  as:  
7.1  concept  Naming  
Under  concept  naming,  comprehensive  list  of  terms that represents the domain concepts is created.  According to Roussey, & et al .,37  process of domain  concepts  extraction  is  based  on: 
• Based  on  text:  Text  is  considered  to  be  a  
rich  source  of  information.  It  can  be  used  for  
selecting terms. Further, quantitative techniques  
like co-occurrence may be used to extract core  
concepts.  
• Based  on  thesaurus:  Thesaurus  is  considered  
as  an  organised  knowledge  structure  and  can  
be  used  in  developing  ontology. 
• Based on relational database: Structural nature  
of  relational  database  can  be  used  to  extract  
concepts,  relationships  and  properties. • Based on UML diagram: Unified Modeling Language,  
other  in  level  of  semantics,  but  still  of  the  intrinsic  feature  of  thesaurus  to  represent  the  knowledge  structure,  it  can  serve  as  a  base  for  ontology  development.  In  present  work,  Nanotechnology  thesaurus  developed  by  the  author  served  as  a  base  for  creation  of  Nanotechnology  ontology.  
7.2 cONcEPt  HIErArcHY 
Kim  &  et  al .,38 suggested  three  methods  to  develop  concept  hierarchy: 
(a) Top-down  approach:  (From  generalisation  to  
specific) process begins with one or more general  
concepts  in  the  domain  and  successively,  it  
specialise  the  concepts.      
(b) Bottom-up  approach:  (From  specialisation  to  
generalisation) process begins with most specific  
concepts,  with  subsequent  grouping  of  these  
classes  into  related  general  concepts. 
(c) Middle-out  approach:  (From  most  important  
concepts  to  generalisation  and  specialisation) 
under  this  approach  most  important  domain  
concepts  are  extracted  and  then  these  are  
generalised  or  specialised  as  appropriate. 
7.3  concept’s  Property  and  concept  
  Association  
Each  concept  has  one  or  more  properties  that  define  its  attribute.  Properties  of  domain  concepts  need  to  be  defined  and  documented.  
Association  between  concepts  denotes  the  meaningful relationships between concepts. Relationship  marked  between  the  concepts  should  explain  how  a concept is semantically related to another. In this  sense, ontology lead over thesaurus, as in ontology,  relationships  are  comparatively  more  refined  and  semantically  enriched.  
7.4  Formalisation  
According to Random House Webster’s Concise  College Dictionary39  formalise means ‘to make formal,  especially  for  the  sake  of  official  or  authorised  acceptance: to formalise an agreement with a legal  contract’.  In  context  of  ontology,  it  refers  to  the  process  involved  in  making  the  sematic  domain  knowledge  structure  into  machine  readable  form.  For this transformation, there exist number of Web  technologies to represent semantic knowledge structure  into  machine  readable  form,  and  ontology  editors  designed  for  creating  and  editing  ontologies.

•  Ontology  Editors 
These are the applications developed to support  the  development  and  manipulation  of  ontologies.  Substantial  efforts  in  this  direction  resulted  in  the  appearance  of  number  of  tools  worldwide.  However, some of tools are available free on Web.  Discussing the tools that can be used for implementing  metadata for ontologies by using ontology languages  Youn  and  McLeod43 briefed  several  applications  in  their  study-  Protege  2000,  OilEd,  Apollo,  RDFedt,  OntoLingua,  OntoEdit,  WebODE,  KAON,  ICOM,  
• DOE,  WebOnto,  Medius  Visual  Ontology  Modeler,  LinKFactory  Workbench,  and  K-Infinity.  Khondoker  & Mueller44 conducted a survey to compare various  ontology development tools.  This comparative study  covered Protege, SWOOP, Internet Business Logic,

8. DEVELOPING  NANO tEcHNOLOGY  
ONtOLOGY  bY  USING  ‘ NMAP’  SOF tWArE 
To retrieve the semantic word map of Nanotechnology  in RDF format, nMap application which was developed  specifically for the study was employed. The application  nMap  is  a  graphical  user  interface  (GUI)  software  that  uses  VB.Net  as  front-end  tool  and  MS-Access  as back-end tool. As compared to the other existing  ontology  editors,  nMap  is  more  user  friendly  and  can  be  used  by  a  person  with  little  computer  knowledge.  
8.1  Features  of  nMap 
nMap  offers  the  following  features: 
• term relationship:  This feature helps in defining  
and  displaying  various  semantic  relationships  
between  terms.  It  also  offers  flexibility  to  add  
new associations between terms, i.e., property,  
attribute,  characteristic,  etc. 
• Predictive Searching : nMap provide autonomy  
to users to perform random searching on term/ 
concepts. This feature offers the dropdown just  
under the search box which displays selectable  
suggestions  for  search  query.

Data  Export  facility:  Output  retrieved  can  be  exported in various semantic machine readable  formats  like  XML  and  RDF.  This  feature  will  support  reusability  of  exported  data  in  other  applications  for  further  research. 
Data Portability:  nMap  provides  the  facility  to  read the data from file received in the prescribed

format. This feature reduces the user(s) efforts  in  data  entry.    
Graph  Plotting :  Graph  can  be  generated  for  each  approached  concept  and  can  be  saved  as  image. 
Data Modification : This feature allows the user  to  edit  the  terms/concepts. 
9.  FINDINGS 
The  study  comes  out  with  Nanotechnology  ontology  in  RDF  framework  for  which  semantic  structure  of  around  2585  Nanotechnology  terms  was  utilised  in  combination  with  nMap  software.  The  tool  offers  a  semantic  knowledge  structure  to  Nanotechnology  researchers  in  machine  readable  environment.  Further,  development  of  ontology  in  RDF  format  serve  interoperability  and  will  further  support  semantic  interpretation  by  machines  to  facilitate  human  understanding. 
10. EVALUAtION  OF  rDF  SYNt AX 
To establish quality assurance for RDF structure  that appeared as the outcome of ontology, World Wide  Web Consortium (W3C) RDF validation platform was  approached.   This  W3C  platform  helps  in  attaining  structural  validation  for  RDF  syntax.

15.  cONcLUSIONS 
Amount  of  Nanotechnology  information  that  is  appearing and added daily on Web make it difficult  for scholars to retrieve all the relevant information.   The  ultimate  solution  to  this  problem  is  to  manage  and chart this widely available information with the  help  of  semantically  rich  structures  like  ontologies  that could enhance the understanding and reasoning  capabilities  of  both  human  and  computers.
