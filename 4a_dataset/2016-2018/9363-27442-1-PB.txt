AbstrACt 
Library is a repository of reading material for use. During the last two and half decades, there has been a tremendous  growth in information and communication technology (ICT) which has swayed not only publishing industry but also  on the readers as well. With the development in ICT, books and journals are published in print and electronic formats.  However, both of the formats have advantages and disadvantages over each other. Old generation still prefer to read  print books and journals, whereas new generation prefer online text. Advent of new reading devices like Kindle, Nook,  I Pad, and smart phones have made e-reading easy. Various surveys across the world have been done to know the  preference of the users towards print and e-text and it has been concluded that for comprehensive reading, print books  and journals are used whereas for casual reading or research projects, online books and journals are required. Keeping  in view the users preference, it is assumed that print and e-version of books and journals will go simultaneously.

1.  IntroDUCtIon 
Before  early  sevenies,  the  printed  reading  material  was available in the library. Later, advent of microfiche  and  microform  facilitated  the  data  storage.  The  data  put  in  the  microfilm  was  read  by  microfilm  reader.  Only  one  person  at  one  time  used  to  read  the  data  and  provision  for  any  change  in  the  data  was  not  possible.  Later, advent of computer replaced the Microfilm reader  and  further,  with  the  dawn  of  ICT,  networking  of  data  became  feasible  which  led  to  resource  sharing. 
Today, the world is witnessing that traditional printed  resources  have  been  replaced  with  electronic  and  habit  of  reading  books,  journals,  magazines,  newspapers  and  other course material has also undergone a rapid change.  In  the  present  scenario,  where  the  reading  material  is  available in divergent formats, therefore, user preference  is required to formulate a need-based acquisition policy  for  balance  collection  in  the  library.  Dayanand  Medical  College  &  Hospital,  Ludhiana  is  one  of  the  prestigious  Medical  Colleges  of  North  India  providing  teaching,  research  and  patients  care  services.  Dayanand  Medical  College  &  Hospital,  Ludhiana  came  to  exist  in  the  year  1964 and 1st   MBBS  batch  was  started  in  the  year  1965.  The  college  is  affiliated  with  Baba  Farid  University  of  Health  Sciences,  Faridkot  and  MCI,  New  Delhi  as  well  and  has  the  recognition  of  the  following  courses.  (a)  MBBS;  (b)  MD/MS  (19  subjects);  (c)  DM/M  Ch  (8  subjects). Apart  from  the  above  degree  courses,  various  
other  para  medical  courses  are  also  available.  College  library  through  its  reading  material  and  services  helps  in conducting successful research programmes, teaching  and  patients  care  and  in  this  context  journals  play  an  important  role  informing  the  latest  research  findings  which  not  only  avoid  the  duplication  of  research  works  but  also  refine  the  previous  studies. 
on  all  working  days,  library  functions  from  8  am  to 2 am (midnight) on Sunday/Holiday it functions from  9  am  to  11  pm,  the  highest  working  hours  among  the  Medical  Colleges  of  North  India.  Central  library  has  over  15,700  books,  17,000  back  volumes  of  journals,  over  hundred  online  books,  200  books  on  CD/DVD  ROMs.  In  the  current  year,  200  print  journals  (national  and  international)  have  been  subscribed.  Apart  from  the  print  journals,  subscriptions  for  print  and  online  of  important  journals  are  also  available.  Institution  has  an  access  to  HSLIBNET  consortium  of  Baba  Farid  University of Health Sciences, Faridkot. Access to online  journals  of  international  publishers  is  available  in  the  consortium  which  is  updated  annually  on  the  need  of  the  users.  Besides,  international  journals,  access  to  health  sciences  databases  like  EBSCO  and  Proquest  is  also  available.  In  India,  a  few  consortia  on  health  sciences  are  available  and  HSLIBNET  is  one  of  them. The whole library is Wi-fi and 25 latest computers have  been  installed  for  the  use  of  students  and  faculty  as  well.  However,  majority  of  the  students  use  their  own  laptops  to  access  e-journals,  and  e-books.

  were  first  who  wrote  about  transition  of  print  to  electronic.  In  the  late  1990  and  early 2000, the proliferation of ‘bundled’ journal packages  began.  Publishers  and  aggregators  started  the  practice  of  offering  their  e-journals  in  packages.  Later,  a  few  publishers  or  aggregators  have  become  more  flexible  by  allowing  libraries  to  select  specific  titles  rather  than  forced  to  take  them  all.  
Developments in ICT and consequently availability of  e-resources over printed entailed the library professionals  across  the  world  to  know  the  preference  of  the  users  towards  print  and  e-resources.  Different  methods  like  surveys,  questionnaires  and  interviews  were  used  to  know  the  preference. A  study  conducted  at  Universidad  National  Autonomia  de  Mexico  (UNAM),  majority  of  the  students  preferred  print  and  63  %  students  reported  that  they  can  read  on  computer  not  more  than  one  hour (EMR Leyva)2.  In  essence,  readers  of  printed  text  understand  the  material  whereas  readers  of  digital  text  only  remember  the  material.  The  cognitive  difference  between  understanding  and  remembering  is  significant  as once a concept is understood, it becomes a long term  memory. Without understanding, a newly learned concept  is nothing more than a short term memory that cannot be  considered  as  a  foundation  for  more  difficult  concept3.  Bierman4, et  al.,  identified  discomfort  in  reading  on  a  desktop or laptop as a problem, as did Muir & Hawes5 &  Cassidy6, et  al.,  had  a  related  observation.  82  %  of  the  users’  group  that  did  not  use  e-books  would  more  likely to use them if they had a more convenient devices  such as I Pad, or Nook/Kindle. Woody, Daniel & Baker7  also concluded in their findings that as course material,  students prefer printed books rather than e-book. Reading  technical content in e-book format takes more time than  reading print8. Bebedetto9  & Kretzschmar 
10 made surveys  and concluded overwhelming preference for print books  over digital media. Kretzschmar10 confirmed that old people  read from LCDs with ease and comprehension, however,  concluded that print books are of more pleasant to read.  Young generation of Google born era reported in a survey  that  they  preferred  reading  from  books  to  screens.  In  their  reports,  it  has  been  said  that  they  do  discover  an  important text on internet and likely get print out before  attempting  in  depth  reading11.  Makkini  &  Pulla12   made  a  survey  on  the  use  of  e-journals  by  research  scholars  of university libraries of Andhra Pradesh and found that  29.72  %  research  scholars  use  print  journals  frequently.  Majority of research scholars (54.61 %) replied that print  journals  are  very  important. 
Levine-Clark13   made  a  survey  on  2000  participants  which  showed  that  59  %  of  users  were  aware  that  library  provided  e-books.  They  found  that  users  adjust  format  preference  depending  on  their  needs.  Liu14 has  also  found  that  graduate  academic  library  users  liked  online  access  resources,  however,  preferred  to  get  print  copy  of  the  electronic  document  for  depth  reading.  
Shelburne15   in  a  survey  with  1500  respondents  showed  that  55  %  of  faculty,  students  and  staff  were  aware  of  library  e-books  availability.  Slater16   conducted  a  study  in  the  university  library  of  Oakland  that  compared  the  circulation  of  e-books  between  printed  resources  and  found  that  users’  preference  in  the  fields  of  science  and  technology  was  leaning  towards  e  -books  format  whereas  users’  preference  of  humanities  field  was  in  direction  of  printed  resources.  The  research  has  also  demonstrated that students view easy access advantages  of e-book as its primary benefit. In different research by  Zhang & Beckman17   presented  that  the  use  of  e-book  is  rather  common  with  ratio  of  53  %  amongst  university  students.  However,  in  the  same  study,  it  was  concluded  that  advantage  of  electronic  format  is  more  valuable  though,  it  is  not  preferred.  It  was  also  determined  that  researchers  were  not  aware  of  the  available  e-resources  in  the  libraries  on  their  own  field.  
3. AIM 
The  study  was  conducted  to  know  the  following: (a) Preference of the library users towards e-books and  
e-journals  over  printed  resources  to  devise  users  
need-based  acquisition  policy; 
(b) Advantages  and  disadvantages  of  e-resources  over  
printed  resources;  and 
(c) Usage  of  traditional  library  in  the  era  of  digital/ 
virtual  library. 
4.  MEtHoDoLogy 
Library  has  different  types  of  reading  material  in  different  formats  and  in  this  scenario  to  have  a  precise  users need based collection, user preference towards the  reading material is must. To know the users preferences,  a  well  structured  questionnaire  was  prepared  and  given  to  150  active  library  users  who  have  used  books  and  journals  in  both  of  the  formants  (print  and  electronic).  Select  users  based  survey  was  done  in  the  month  of  October 2014. The users were divided into three groups  consisting  of  50  users  in  each  group  belonging  to  UG,  PG  and  Faculty.  
5.  DAtA  An ALysIs 
All  the  questionnaires  given  to  select  library  users  were  get  back.  The  data  analysed  on  their  preferences  based on frequency of visits, purpose of visit, time spent  by the users in the library, advantages of reading e-books  and journals over printed resources and preferences towards  e-books  and  e-journals,  and  printed  resources  . 
5.1  Frequency  of  Library visits 
As most of the people think that when there are virtual  libraries  round  the  clock  and  everything  is  available  in  the internet, therefore, existing libraries are not required.  To  answer  the  above  question,  Table  1  shows  that  88  (58.67  %)  users  visit  the  library  daily  or  alternative

day whereas only 5 (3.33 %) users don’t visit the library  and  reason  may  be  their  own.  The  library  is  enriched  with good collection of books and journals in both of the  formats  and  apart  from  own  students,  outsider  Medical  graduates of the region who are preparing for PG courses  get membership of library even in the present digital era  which  reflects  the  importance  of  traditional  library.

Library is the repository of reading material available  in  different  formats.  Table  2  shows  that  107  (71.33  %)  users  visit  the  library  for  self  study.  Of  the  150  users,  only 13 (8.66 %) users visit the library to borrow books  and  journals  which  reflects  the  diminishing  trend  of  borrowing  books  from  the  library  in  medical  college,  as  all  the  students  have  their  own  books  and  further  most  of  the  textbooks  are  available  in  e-format  which  are  free,  easy  to  read  and  downloading.

5.3  Usage  of  Library  (time-spend) 
As the library remains open 18 hours at stretch from  8 am to 2 am (midnight) and users get full advantage of  the library. One UG student uses the library maximum 15  hours.  However,  majority  of  the  users  74  (49.33%)  use  the  library  for  one  to  two  hours.  UG  and  PG  students  use  the  library  extensively  where  as  faculty  members  have  to  do  numerous  tasks  (patients  care,  teaching  and  research),  therefore,  they  have  meagre  time  to  visit  the  library (Table 3). Moreover, in present digital era, most  of  the  required  books  and  journals  are  available  online  and  they  use  them  sitting  in  their  own  offices.

6.  DIsCUssIons 
The  ICT  has  swayed  on  each  and  every  sphere  of  life and library has not remained unaffected. Introduction  of  ICT  in  Library  &  Information  Science,  all  functions  have  become  easy,  fast  and  time  saving.  As  already  mentioned  that  Central  library  of  our  institution  is  providing  all  manual  as  well  as  automated  services  to  its  patrons  and  to  know  their  preference  towards  e-resources  over  printed,  a  questionnaire  was  made  and  distributed  among  the  150  library  users.  Questionnaire  was  analysed  on  the  preference  of  the  users. Table  1  of  present  study  shows  that  88  (58.60  %)  users  visit  the  library  daily  or  alternative  day  whereas  in  one  other  study  by  Thanuskodi18   on  usage  of  e-resources  at  Dr.  T.P.M  Library,  Madurai  Kamaraj  University,  Madras  on  260  research  scholars  found  87  (33.46  %)  users  visited  the  library  daily  which  is  similar  to  the  result  of  our  study.  In  present  study  (Table  2),  107  (71.33  %)  users  visit  the  library  for  self  study.  Of  the  150  users,  only  13  (8.66  %)  users  visit  the  library  to  borrow  books  and  journals.  In  present  digital  era,  most  of  the  information  are available in internet, therefore, culture of borrowing  books  and  journals  from  the  library  is  diminishing. 
Books  and  journals  are  very  useful  be  they  are  in  print  or  digital  format.  Print  version,  though  an  old  format but useful, whereas digital text is more useful over  print.  In  digital  library,  there  is  no  physical  boundary,  easy  &  multiple  access,  information  retrieval  is  easy,  long preservation & conservation of text and information  storage  requires  very  little  space.  In  present  study,  93  (62  %)  users  informed  that  information  they  get  from  e-books and e- journals are very useful, time saving and  update. Though, users have shown huge interest towards  digital  text,  however,  57  (38  %)  users  said  they  never  used  e-books  and  e-journals  (Table  4).  
E-reading  has  also  a  few  disadvantages  as  constant  reading  is  not  feasible,  creates  strain  on  the  brain  and  eyes. Sometimes, login problems and power failure create  obstacle for digital text use. Readers of the printed text  understand the material, while the readers of digital text  only  remember  the  material.  Without  understanding,  a  newly learned concept is nothing more than a short term  memory. Noyes & Garland3, Ackerman & Goldsmith18  have  all  concluded  that  computer  screens  are  not  conducive  to  reading  longer  academic  texts.  
The library has an adequate reading material on both  of  the  formats  and  also  has  the  latest  infrastructure  for  e-reading.  In  present  study,  50  (33.33  %)  users  showed  interest  towards  print  books  &  journals,  whereas,  17  (11.33  %)  users  showed  interest  towards  e-books  and  e-journals. 83 (55.33 %) users showed their preferences  towards  Hybrid  library  (Table  5).  Age  factor  is  one  of  the reasons that people born before Google era prefer to  print version of the books and journals. In present study,  of the 50 faculty members, none of them has desired for  e-books & e-journals exclusively, 19 (38 %) users opted  for  print  only  and  remaining  31  (62  %)  users  desired  
both  print  and  e-books  &  journals.  In  our  library  a  few  important  journals  are  being  subscribed  in  both  of  the  formats,  however,  majority  of  the  faculty  members  still  use  print  version  of  journals.  Results  of  present  study  towards  print  vs.e-books  and  e-journals  preference  are  comparatively the same as concluded by Thanuskodu19. In  one other study Naushad & Faizul20  made survey among  research scholars at Central Science Library, University  of Delhi regarding preference of the users towards print  and e-resources and found that majority of the users still  use  print  journals  as  compare  to  e–resources  which  are  similar  to  the  results  of  the  present  study.  They  also  concluded  that  e-resources  are  predominantly  used  for  research  purpose  and  presentation  only. 
7.  ConCLUsIons 
Over  the  millennia,  reading  is  a  culture  that  has  changed  overtime.  However,  it  has  also  physiologically  changed  the  brain.  The  evolution  has  brought  us  to  what  popular  technology  a  perfect  cultural  product,  the  book  we  continue  to  hold  on  today  and  it  is  also  now  bringing  us  into  revolutionary  new  world  of  online  digital  text.  The  book  on  paper  is  far  from  dead.  It  has  survived  from  predictions  of  its  imminent  demise  for  many  years.  There  have  been  continuously  changes  in  information  and  communication  technology  which  is  affecting  the  whole  world.  Things  of  today  become  obsolete  for  tomorrow.  Users  of  new  generation  want  digital text whereas people of old generation still love to  read from print books and journals. Digital text reading  is  feasible  for  short  period  to  read  one  or  two  articles/ chapters  for  reference  purpose  only.  Whereas,  for  long  reading and academics purposes, print books and journals  are  needed.  E-books  and  e-journals  are  for  supplement  to print books and journals. Barry Cull21   has  mentioned  that new technologies often don’t supplant older proven  technologies that accomplish a similar task, e.g., internet  video  streaming  has  not  replaced  television  and  further  which has not replaced radio before that. It is concluded  that we are moving towards Hybrid library, whereas print  version  appears  likely  to  remain  alive  for  foreseeable  period  and  new  changes  in  ICT  and  digital  text  would  also  be  continuing.
