This conceptual paper reviews literature on marketing of library products and services, and discusses various  ways and means for the same. Several marketing techniques to promote the usage of library resources and services  have been highlighted in the literature. It is seen that majority of libraries do not have a marketing culture. It is  recognised 	 that 	 libraries 	 need 	 to 	 formulate 	 marketing 	 plan 	 along 	 with 	 fnancial 	 budget 	 on 	 a 	 yearly 	 basis 	 so 	 that 	 library resources can be utilised optimally. Libraries in developing countries have been struggling to conduct outreach  programmes to market their resources and services. Latest technologies such as, Web 2.0 and mobile services have  opened 	 up 	 new 	 avenues 	 to 	 do 	 marketingin 	 	 effcient 	 and 	 cost 	 effective 	 ways. 	 Therefore,libraries 	 should 	 	 not 	 leave 	 any stone unturned to apply the latest technologies in promotion of resources and services amongst the stakeholders.  The funding agencies must formulate guidelines for marketing the library resources and services so that the library  
resources can be utilised optimally.

1. IntRoductIon 
Marketing is an approach to achieve users’ satisfaction.  The idea of applying the concept of marketing in academic  libraries  started  taking  momentum  during  1969  to  1973  when  a  series  of  articles  were  published  by  eminent  scholars  in  the  field.  Marketing  and  promotion  is  vital  for  libraries  to  enhance  their  reputation  and  usage.  Library professionals’ positive attitude towards marketing  is  a  prerequisite  for  a  successful  plan  and  execution  to  market library products and services1. Maximum research  published on marketing in library and information science  describes  the  concept,  and  a  few  discuss  the  practical  aspects  of  marketing  in  libraries.  Surprisingly,  a  small  number  of  studies  have  been  published  on  the  attitude  of library professionals towards marketing2. The methods  of  marketing  have  changed  from  print  media  to  social  media. For example, Wiki, blog, Facebook, Twitter, Flicker,  YouTube,  instant  messaging,  etc.,  can  be  used  to  foster  the  usage  of  library  sources  and  services.  Libraries  are  under tremendous pressure to cope with users’ demands,  and  it  is  the  need  of  the  hour  that  the  libraries  adopt  tools and techniques for marketing to satisfy the diverse  user groups. Non-print materials are more prevalent and  digitised material is the new trend. Tools and techniques  have  given  an  opportunity  to  promote  effective  use  of  library  resources3.

Libraries  should  have  a  clear  plan  to  market  their  digital  services.  Several  studies  have  been  conducted  
Received 10 February 2016, online published 26 April 2016 
to  look  into  this  aspect.  Libraries  need  to  adopt  a  coherent  approach  instead  of  scattered  ones.  Further,  it  is  of  utmost  importance  to  deliver  the  right  service  at  the  right  time  to  appropriate  users  in  the  right  place  in  a cost effective manner4. Therefore,  libraries  should  try  to  formulate  marketing  strategies.  It  will  also  aim  to  satisfy  the  five  laws  of  library  science.  Libraries  must  continue  to  evolve  to  respond  to  the  digital,  financial  and  societal  changes.  
If  libraries  do  not  come  up  to  the  expectations  of  the  users,  then  commercial  ventures  may  grab  the  opportunity. To counter the situation, the National library  of Scotland (NLS) decided to introduce effective marketing  relations to ensure the awareness of library sources and  services  among  stakeholders5.  Harrington  &  Li6   found  that  marketing  initiatives  require  thorough  examination  of  competitors.  They  need  to  identify  suitable  methods  of  marketing,  assigning  the  responsibility  to  the  staff  and  assess  the  effective  methods  used  on  a  periodic  basis.  Adoyoyin7   stated  that  marketing  library  services  is  also  important  because  of  its  scope  and  also  since  major  portion  of  the  organisations’  expenditure  goes  to  services. Major sector of employment is in service sector  worldwide.  The  demand  for  the  service  is  fluctuating.  Hence,  marketing  of  products  or  services  have  several  implications.  The  author  defined  marketing  in  relation  to  library  services  as  follows: 
•	 Marketing  is  user-centered. 
•	 Marketing  is  profit  centered.  
•	 Marketing  anticipates  the  changes  through  time.

Libraries  do  not  have  competitors  in  an  academic  organisation; even then, libraries should avoid complacency.  Therefore, a well structured written plan should be the part  of library strategies to promote the usage of resources8.  The  purpose  of  any  marketing  plan  in  the  library  is  to  increase the number of users, develop favourable mindsets,  and convincing the users about the benefits of accepting  the  library  services  and  products.  Therefore,  in  such  an  environment,  user-centric  approach  in  delivering  the  information  becomes  market  driven.  However,  library  professionals  have  been  slow  in  adopting  a  marketing  attitude.  Hence,  an  urgent  need  is  felt  to  get  rid  of  complacency to face the challenges assertively9. Kanaujia10 postulated  that  each  library  should  have  marketing  plan  which  involves  contextualization  of  process,  objective  defined  on  yearly  basis,  4P  (product,  price,  place  and  promotion), training of the staff and allocation of funds  to  execute  the  plan.  Each  library  should  follow  the  defined  marketing  strategies  so  that  expectations  of  the  users can be matched with library products and services.  She recommended that, to increase user awareness about  library  sources  and  services,  the  financial  support  of  the  respective  organisation  is  essential.  Librarians  must  be  careful  in  deciding  charges  of  selective  services  to  recover  the  cost  so  that  services  can  be  popular  among  the  user  group. A  wrong  decision  to  recover  the  cost  of  service  may  fade  the  reputation  of  the  library11. 
Kaur & Rani12  advocated that library and information  centres  ought  to  have  the  mission  to  do  marketing  of  library  products  and  services.  Researchers  expressed  their  disappointment,  during  surveys  in  Punjab  and  Chandigarh  regions  in  India  that  no  library  is  found  with  own  logo,  mission  statement  and  a  professional  designated  to  perform  the  marketing  of  resources.  A  successful  marketing  plan  should  include  librarians,  faculty  members,  and  students.

In  his  study,  Singh13,  while  examining  the  Finnish  research libraries, found three kinds of marketing cultures—  (i) strong, (ii) medium, and (iii) weak. Germano14  advocated  the  development  of  service  with  a  valuable  plan.  The  marketing  activities  must  have  their  own  narrative  to  patrons 	 while 	 reﬂecting 	 their 	 specifc 	 needs 	 at 	 appropriate 	 times. In this way, libraries can establish a strong sense  of  value  among  its  users  to  create  loyalty.  Singh15 advised  in  his  study  that  organisations  ought  to  know  their  marketing  culture  prior  to  the  move  for  branding  information  sources  and  services.  
Robinson16  communicated that, to remain relevant in  this fast changing world, libraries must adopt a marketing  orientation.  Libraries  must  try  to  understand  who  their  users  are  and  what  they  do.  Garoufallou17   conducted  a  survey  in  151  central  and  departmental  libraries  in  Greece  and  found  that  majority  of  libraries  recognised  
120 
the  concept  of  marketing  but  had  not  adopted  very  well.  Operational  problems  are  identified  as  the  main  hindrance  in  application  of  the  marketing  concept  in  these  academic  libraries.  These  libraries  need  to  go  a  long  way  to  implement  marketing  efficiently.

Relationship  marketing  (RM)  is  the  approach  to  build  relationships  with  users.  Broadly,  RM  cultivates  the relationships among users and staff. Thus, it helps in  retaining the existing users and enhances loyalty among  staff.  The  RM  uses  ICT  to  contact  and  communicate  more easily with library users and potential users in the  society. David & Sagun,18  in a study conducted at Rizal  Library of the Ateneo de Manila University, suggested that  libraries  ought  to  start  relationship  marketing  strategies  with  students,  faculty,  to  make  the  library  resources  and  services  visible,  and  open  lines  of  communication.  Henderson19   stated  that  RM  approach  be  adopted  by  library professionals while marketing digital collections.  Further, he described the reason of adopting this approach  as  follows:  
•	 No  cost  involved; 
•	 Less  need  to  offer  incentives  to  users; 
•	 Less  price  sensitive; 
•	 Satisfied  customers  will  recommend  the  service  to  
others users. Thus, library visibility will be enhanced  
among  the  user  groups.

Library  personnel  need  to  formulate  a  proactive  approach  of  marketing  to  promote  the  usage  of  library  sources and services20. Users of the library need personal  attention  and  recognition,  apart  from  satisfying  their  information  needs.  To  make  the  library  products  and  services  user-centric,  library  personnel  must  remember  the  4Ps,  i.e.,  products,  price,  place  and  promotion.  To  satisfy  the  user  groups,  librarians  must  evaluate  the  services  on  a  regular  basis  so  that  libraries  can  give  best  products  and  services.  
Mu21   found  that  academic  libraries  ought  to  market  the services actively. Apart from this, reference librarians  must  keep  in  mind  the  language  aptitude,  learning  style  and  subject  of  interest  of  users  while  marketing  library  resources.  Library  should  provide  a  comfortable  environment of interaction so that users feel free to ask  questions to the reference librarians. Moreover, university  libraries  should  adapt  more  systematic  technique  in  users’  needs  assessment  so  that  libraries  can  provide  the  best  services22.

Website of library is a vital tool to share the vision  and  mission.  It  is  a  handy  tool  to  announce  the  yearly  plan,  new  additions  and  new  initiatives  of  the  library.  The resources subscribed by the library can be delivered  

========2========

BHARDWAJ & JAIN : MARKETING OF LIBRARY RESOURCES AND SERVICES  
to  users  in  a  systematic  way  by  building  a  website  of  the library. Schmidt23  stated that libraries can adopt new  mode  of  promotional  strategies  to  access  the  books  and  journals  in  print  and  digital  format  to  make  sure  every  book  has  its  reader  in  the  new  age.  Study  suggested  that librarians must adopt the change by enhancing their  skills,  attitude  and  aptitude  so  that  the  needs  of  the  users  can  be  understood  and  resources  can  be  utilised  optimally.  Kaur  &  Rani24   postulated  that  libraries  must  organise orientation programmes, publicity of resources,  and  personal  contacts  on  a  frequent  basis.  Besides  this,  library  should  have  a  website  which  can  be  used  for  advertising library products and services and to distribute  and  disseminate  library  products  and  services.  
Islam & Hossain25   examined  57  university  libraries  in  Bangladesh  and  found  the  websites  are  not  fully  utilised  for  marketing  of  library  resources  and  services.  Majority  of  websites  do  not  provide  online  literacy,  online  help,  and  copyright  documents.  Besides  this,  no  library  conducts  online  survey  or  networking  using  the  website.  Similar  study  was  conducted  by  Kaur26 in  Malaysian libraries and found that libraries are not using  the websites properly to do promotional activities among  the user groups. Gardner27, et al.,  conducted  a  study  on  69 academic library websites to learn how they promote  library resources and services among faculty members. The  study  found  that  faculty  webpages  are  most  significant  to  promote  library  services  for  research  and  teaching.  Further, the study revealed that libraries have not utilised  the opportunities in contributing scholarly communication  through creating institutional repositories and open access  measures. Libraries need to take such initiatives to remain  relevant  and  visible  among  the  users.  
Wenhong28  stated that library marketing is a matching  process between library resources and expectations of the  users. Using marketing techniques libraries can enhance  their visibility and make users more successful in using  the library resources and services. The author suggested  that  exhibitions  are  a  good  marketing  idea  in  academic  institutions.  Libraries  have  been  demanding  inclusion  of  marketing  links  on  their  websites.  Therefore,  library  professionals  must  grab  this  opportunity  in  the  digital  environment29.

A proliferation of information is reaching the society  after  development  in  information  technology.  Web  2.0  has  changed  the  delivery  and  marketing  methods  of  information  sources  and  services.  Commercial  agencies  have  come  forward  to  do  this  work  for  big  commercial  ventures  to  promote  their  products.  Similarly,  libraries  have  adopted  the  Web  2.0  tools.  In  the  last  ten  years,  several  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the  use  of  Web  2.0 tools in libraries. Landis30  stated that using the social  networking tools such as Facebook can be handy to market  the resources and events. The social networking sites can  also  be  useful  to  remove  the  barriers  in  dissemination  
of information. Xia31  found in his study that use of Web  2.0  tools  to  market  the  library  resources  and  service  builds  a  positive  connection  between  the  library  and  users. Ekart32   explained  in  his  study  that  using  Twitter,  libraries not only get feedback about library services but  also  get  valuable  information  about  the  library  users.  This valuable information can be used in planning library  resources  and  services.  
Mamatha33  concluded in a study that Twitter was used  as an interaction and communication tool as libraries had  a  large  number  of  followers,  which  can  be  helpful.  She  suggested  that  professional  staff  members  be  used  for  regularly  updating  and  maintaining  the  library  Twitter  feeds to attract more users. Yi34  conducted a study on 400  librarians  in  37  academic  libraries  in Australia  to  know  their perception on Web 2.0 tools. The study found that  librarians  are  using  a  variety  of  Web  2.0  tools  such  as,  blog, Facebook, Twitter, Wiki, and You Tube. Vucovich35 et  al.,   pointed  out  that  YouTube  can  be  successfully  used in imparting instructions to promote library use. In  addition, reference services can be provided successfully  using YouTube. 
Hendrix36, et al., conducted a study on 70 librarians  to  know  the  use  of  Facebook  and  found  that  majority  of  libraries  use  the  social  networking  sites  (SNSs)  to  predominately market library services. Besides this, several  studies  have  been  conducted  to  know  the  application  of  rich  site  summary  (RSS)  feeds  applications  in  libraries.  It  was  found  that  the  RSS  feeds  updates  are  being  used  by academic libraries to market new library services and  new  additions  of  print  and  electronic  collections.  It  is  well  established  that  proper  use  of  these  feeds  services  can  be  useful  tools  in  promotion  of  library  resources  and services37, 38. Breeding39   advised  the  libraries  to  use  the  RSS  feeds  to  attract  potential  users  to  the  library  and  found  the  key  challenges  in  the  use  of  Web  2.0  technologies are applications of these tools in marketing  and promotion. Xia40  revealed in his study that by active  participation  of  librarians  on  Facebook  Groups  they  can  always  keep  the  discussion  alive  by  responding  to  the  queries  of  students  Therefore,  these  tools  can  be  a  crucial medium to promote the library and help the users  in  study  and  research.

 states that mobile-based services have  been adopted by many users. These services have become  extremely popular among the users. The technology has  been  used  to  start  a  library  alerts  service. A  study  was  conducted by Anbu & Mavuso42  at University of Swaziland  in collaboration with Emerald Group Publishing Limited  and  a  need  was  identified  to  create  a  prototype  model  for  SMS-based  service  to  do  marketing  of  the  library  resources.  Study  also  found  that  longer  SMSs  need  to  split  up  to  shorter  messages. The  SMS  service  is  found  effective  for  timely  delivery  of  information  resources  to the users in an economic way. Rheingold43 found  the

use  of  mobile  phone  in  marketing  library  services  and  resources  as  economic.  Further,  it  also  provides  instant  response  and  contacts  with  users.  Modern  tools  and  technology are versatile and SMS-based services are cost  effective.  These  SMS-based  services  can  be  used  as  a  tool  to  cater  to  the  information  desire  of  users. 
Five gaps have been identified which are responsible  for unsuccessful delivery of service and affect the quality  of service44, 45. First gap is between users and perception  of the management. The major reason is that managements  do not understand what exactly the users need. The other  reason  of  this  gap  is  that  most  libraries  don’t  conduct  user’s  survey  prior  to  the  start  of  any  service  for  the  users.  Second  gap  is  between  management  perception  and  service  quality  specifications.  The  reason  is,  most  of the time specifications prescribed by the management  do  not  adhere  to  service  quality  specifications.  The  third 	 is 	 quality 	 specifcations 	 and 	 service 	 delivery. 	 The 	 fourth  is  between  delivery  and  promises  to  the  users.  The  fifth  and  last  gap  is  between  perceived  service  and  likely  service.

Library instructional video can be used in promotion  and  marketing  the  library  resources  to  save  the  time  of  users  and  library  personnel.  Martin46   shared  his  experience  of  using  a  video  in  the  promotion  of  the  library at California State University, Northridge. Videos  of  library  resources  and  services  were  posted  on  the  library website. The videos were shared using YouTube.  2744  people  viewed  the  videos  between  September  9,  2010 and July 26, 2012. The campaign received positive  feedback  from  faculty  members.  Using  the  video  the  library increased the users’ awareness about resources and  services,  and  communicated  well.  Similar  attempt  was  made at Dartmouth College and results were satisfactory  in  promotion  of  library  activities  and  services47.

Several  collaborative  efforts  have  been  identified  which  can  be  used  as  a  model  in  promoting  library  resources  and  services.  Duke50,  et  al.,   highlighted  a  collaboration  among  students  and  library  to  promote  the  library’s  reference  service.  In  this  project,  library  reference  service  and  sources  were  promoted  using  the  students’  ideas  and  feedbacks.  
Besides  this,  collaboration  has  been  done  between  libraries  and  information  aggregators.  Betz51,  et  al., reported a peer-to-peer outreach programme in marketing  the citation databases namely, Scopus and Web of Science.  They  named  the  programme  as  student  ambassador  program  (SAm).  The  programme  imparts  training,  and  instructional  and  marketing  material  to  the  participants.  Fourie & Ball52  revealed that librarian, faculty members  and students should be part of the promotional programmes  to  promote  the  use  of  newly  subscribed  resources  and  services.  Competition  programmes  can  be  organised  for  active  participation.

Marketing concept is not well adopted by librarians.  Shontz53,  et  al., surveyed  623  library  professionals  in  public libraries in New Jersey to understand their attitudes  on  marketing  library  resources  and  services.  The  study  found that library administrators and library professionals  who  have  done  a  course  in  marketing  or  attended  any  workshop on marketing have a high priority to apply the  marketing concept in their respective libraries. Grunenwald,  Felicetti  &  Stewart54   postulated  that  several  library  professionals  are  unwilling  to  adopt  and  implement  marketing in the library and information centres. Majority  of  them  believe  that  marketing  of  library  resources  and  services  is  unnecessary  and  unsuitable  for  libraries.  Hence,  the  adoption  of  the  concept  is  subject  to  and  varies from professional to professional. Librarians with  good knowledge of marketing prefer to apply the concept  to  promote  the  library  resources  among  users.  Besides  this,  they  market  the  library  resources  to  enhance  the  reputation  of  library.  
13.1 guerrilla  Marketing 
This type of marketing explains untraditional marketing  campaigns  and/or  strategies  which  are  very  effective  to  promote  products  and  services.  The  major  highlight  of  this  marketing  is  that  it  can  be  achieved  with  minimum  budget55.  Ries  &  Trout56   explained  the  term  in  a  book  as ‘Marketing Wafare’ and depicted marketing activities  as  a  combat  to  surmount  the  user’s  mind.  The  basic  principles  of  this  marketing,  Mao-Tse  Tung’s  guerrilla  warfare, have seven rules that describe the principles of  this  technique57-59   as: 
•	 •	 
Concentrate  your  resources

The  select  review  study  concludes  that  librarians  have  shown  a  positive  attitude  towards  the  adoption  of  marketing. However, libraries have not adopted marketing  as a working culture. Research on library marketing is also  slow compared to other emerging areas in the field. The  syllabi of Master programmes in Library and Information  Science do not have provision to discuss case studies to  promote  the  marketing  culture  in  libraries.  Developing  countries’  libraries  are  struggling  to  conduct  outreach  programmes  to  promote  their  resources  and  services.  Therefore,  libraries  ought  to  formulate  a  marketing  plan  along  with  yearly  budget  so  that  every  book  can  get  its  reader  and  every  reader  can  have  his  or  her  book. The  recent  study  of  Nelson  Edewor  also  revealed  the  low  level  use  of  social  media  such  as,  Facebook,  blogs,  Twitter,  e-mail  alerts,  for  marketing.  The  author  expressed  that  absence  of  marketing  plan,  ignorance  on  the content, i.e., what to market, lack of related facilities  and  lack  of  sufficient  funds  are  some  of  the  major  barriers in marketing library and information services60.  Further, open access and search engines have created new  challenges  and  at  the  same  time  opened  a  new  frontier  to  deliver  the  services  to  clients.  Therefore,  promoting  and marketing of the resources have become essential for  libraries. Accreditation agencies of academic institutions  ought  to  consider  the  library  marketing  plan  in  grading  and  evaluation.  At  the  same  time,  funding  agencies  of  institution  must  formulate  guidelines  for  marketing  the  library  resources  and  services  so  that  resources  and  services  can  be  used  optimally.
