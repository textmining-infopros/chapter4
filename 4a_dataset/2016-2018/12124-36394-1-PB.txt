Defence Materials Stores and Research and Development Establishment (DMSRDE), Kanpur is working in  the feld of nonmetallic materials. This paper tries to evaluate the usage statistics of Science direct material science  package of M/s Elsevier in terms of number of downloads of full text articles available to users of DMSRDE.  Usage data of science direct material science package from 2005 to 2015 is analysed to assess the usability of  journals in terms of highly utilised or non-utilised journals, average cost per article, and the impact of the online  availability of journal articles on the library services. The study reveals that only 12 per cent of the highly used  titles of package accounts for 65-66 per cent usage. The cost per article study supports package subscription over  
individually selected highly used titles.

1. IntroDUctIon 
Technical information centre’s or libraries are considered  the heart of any research institutions. As the research activities  are the basis for the progress of any country and primary means  of  getting  latest  research  information  is  through  scientifc  and technical journals, so the libraries are spending the huge  portion of their budget in subscribing journals. After realising  the importance of e-journals and to keep pace with the growing  literature  requirements  of  users,  libraries  have  now  started  providing  access  to  e-journals  along  with  print  journals. Libraries don’t just subscribe the e-resources but also ensure  that users get the basic infrastructure, browsing facilities with  greater  bandwidth  and  training  to  avail  the  facilities  offered  to them. Technical Information Centre of Defence Materials  Stores  and  Research  and  Development  Establishment  is  presently  having  approximately  22000  books,  18000  bound  scientifc and technical periodicals; 5000 specifcation, NTIS  reports and standards. It is also having access to various online  journals  through  DRDO  E-Journal  Consortium.  National  Knowledge Network and Internet Centre has also been set-up  where users have been provided 15-20 computers with internet  connectivity of 100 mbps and thus serves as a central hub for  accessing online journals and NPTEL lectures.  
2.  LIterAtUre revIew 
There is a plenty of literature available on usage analysis  and  impact  of  electronic  journals  in  academic  and  research  libraries,  which  can  be  clustered  into  three  categories.  First  category contains articles related to use and user behaviour of  
Received : 16 October 2017, Revised : 30 October2017  Accepted : 28 November 2017, Online published : 01 January 2018 
electronic journals, Second category covers literature related  to  usage  analysis  of  electronic  journals  available  through  consortium and the third category contains articles analysing  subscription  of  full  package  versus  individually  selected  journals  from  package  based  on  journal  and  number  of  full  text article downloads. Though this paper is centered on third  category but we have included articles relevant to our study in  all the categories.  
Davis and Solla1  established a relationship between journal  and  number  of  article  downloads.  Their  study  exemplifes  that for ACS titles, the vast majority of users download few  articles and consult few journals, also a small number of heavy  users  can  have  an  extremely  large  effect  on  the  number  of  total downloads. And lastly, the relationship between journals  consulted  and  article  downloads  is  quadratic,  meaning  that  users  that  rely  on  more  titles  tend  to  download  many  more  articles than expected. Botero2, et al.  analysed the comparative  fndings of two studies undertaken at the University of Florida  Libraries  comparing  online  journal  usage  statistics  derived  from COUNTER-compliant publishers Their evaluation were  intended as tools for determining trends in the costs and use  of  online  journals  at  the  University  of  Florida.  They  also  explored  the  relationship  between  the  large  publisher  online  journal packages and online journal usage, and the effects of  big deal packages on library budgets. One signifcant fnding  of  their  study  was  that  the  relative  cost-effectiveness  of  the  electronic  journal  packages  being  received  through  the  big  deal,  especially  when  these  packages  are  measured  by  the  number of full-text downloads compared to the cost of articles  supplied  by  document  delivery  services  at  HSCL.  Susheela3 pursued  her  study  to  emphasise  the  necessity  of  evaluating  the  library  resources  in  terms  of  their  quality,  cost  beneft

and  usefulness.  She  concluded  that  usage  statistics  certainly  supports  in  the  complex  decision  making  activity  of  serials  management in university libraries. Bansode4  studied the use  and impact of e-journals on the users of University of Pune,  Pune to fnd out the preferred format of use of e-journals and  whether their library satisfes the information needs of its users  They concluded from their study that majority of users prefer  electronic journals compared to print journals and they found  positive response from the users for e journals as they are really  helpful in searching the appropriate references. Nicholas5, et al. highlighted the importance of log usage analysis to determine  the use and information seeking behaviour of the e-resources  and summarises that logs provide a sound indicator of use and  information seeking behaviour albeit in respect to just a part  of  the  information  seeking  journey.  But  also  emphasise  that  in today’s parlance the digital evaluation methods are just not  effective,  economical  or  practical.  And  task  of  fltering  the  unwanted data has become very complex. 
Davis6 analysed  the  annual  e  journal  usage  data  for  the  North  East  Research  Library  (NERL)  consortium  2000  and  2001 for the Academic Press IDEAL aggregate package. Their  study patterns indicated that a small number of journals formed  the majority of total use. Titles not subscribed in print received  about ten times less use than locally subscribed titles. Cluster  analysis revealed three distinct groups of institutions based on  use of the journal package: large research institutions, medical  institutions, and smaller liberal arts colleges and polytechnic  institutes. Student enrolment is a good predictor of total usage,  with medical institutions being an exception. He recommended  that  institutions  consider  their  consortia  membership  and  organise  themselves  into  groups  of  homogenous  institutions  with  similar  missions.  Moorthy  and  Pant7   evaluated  the  use  of  electronic  resources  in  DRDO  Institutes  with  the  help  of  analytical  study  of  usage  of  DRDO  E-Journal  Consortium  for the period 2009-2011 for 8 publishers The study revealed  that usage is highest among large DRDO units and in those  units that carry our research in basic sciences. The labs dealing  in  areas  like  training,  high  altitude  agriculture,  psychology,  certifcation, bio-energy, recruitment of personnel etc. use the  electronic resources less frequently.  
For  analysing  the  big  deal  versus  individual  selected  journal titles Singh and Murthy8  studied the use of Elsevier’s  Science  Direct  at  IIT  Roorkee  to  explain  whether  big  deal  mode is the right approach for consortia subscription or not.  They studied the 1486 number of titles for analysing the usage  of science direct at IIT Roorkee which was based on one year  data of 2003 and found that very small fraction of the titles  available  are  being  heavily  used  and  there  is  a  very  large  portion which either not being used at all or being used rarely.  The  concentration  of  the  requests  around  a  limited  number  of  titles  clearly  shows  that  the  core  collection  is  very  much  alive and active. If IITR subscribe to only 17(1.14 per cent of  the total available) titles than its 25 per cent requirement can  be met. Subscription to 66 (4.4 per cent of the total available  titles) alone can meet 50 per cent requirement and subscription  of 177 titles (only about 12 per cent of the total) can meet its  75 per cent requirement. Thus 88 per cent of the titles are being  subscribed to meet 25 per cent of the total requirement. This

data clearly specifes that the big deal mode of subscription is  not at all in the favour of the consortia. Schopfel and Leduc9 evaluated the usage statistics to compare it with the two modes  of subscription, individually selected journals vs  packages (big  deals). They found that individual subscriptions to journals are  more selective than big deals, and tend towards a traditional  retail  model.  Unlike  subscriptions  through  packages,  usage  and  individual  subscriptions  can  be  related  by  a  similar  inclination. Singh10, et al.  analysed the usage, cost and return  on  investment  (ROI)  of  e-resources  specially  the  Science  Direct  online  database  at  Banaras  Hindu  University  library  system. BHU library subscribes to 13 subject collections out  of 24 subject database provided by science direct. Usage data  of  5  years  (2009-2014)  for  full  text  downloads  and  3  years  (2012-2014)  for  cost  analysis  and  ROI  taken  from  science  Direct  for  analysis.  They  found  that  though  the  number  of  download shows continuous increase in consecutive years, the  cost per download varies according to subscription prices and  conversion rates from USD to INR. They concluded that 13  subject collections subscribed by BHU library is quite useful  and used extensively by its users to support its continuity in  future.  
Singh11   compared  the  full  text  download  statistics  of  springer  journals  for  the  5  year  period  (2007  -2011)  in  an  academic library to identify the most used and least used titles  and  to  establish  mathematical  relation  between  the  number  of titles and number of article download known as principle  of  constant  averages.  His  analysis  showed  that  the  average  download in each group remains more or less constant which  he  termed  as  principle  of  constant  averages  and  represented  mathematically  as  :  if  the  download  data  in  a  scientifc  and  technical institution is arranged in different groups such that  highest download (H) in group one has single digit download  (logH<1.0), group two has double digit download (log(H)=1.0- <2.0, and so on than for every calendar year D/N is equal to  constant (where D= number of downloads in a group and N=  number of journals in that group). The analysis revealed that out  of 2500 titles subscribed only about 125 (only 5 per cent) are  heavily used which can be considered for subscription. He also  stated that careful analysis of usage data can give remarkable  tool for helping librarians.  
Though vast research is available for analysing the usage  and  user  behaviour  of  electronic  journals  and  consortium  based  statistical  usage  analysis,  the  literature  on  analysing  usage  and  cost  effectiveness  of  package  subscription  versus  individually selected title is very few. Most of the articles in  this  category  recommends  procuring  individual  titles  over  package  subscription,  but  this  paper  put  an  effort  to  present  the  cost  effectiveness  of  package  subscription  over  selected  journal titles from package.  
3.   o bjectIve  of the StUDy 
The study confne only to science direct material science  package (SDMSP) on the basis of usage analysis in this article.  The procurement of SDMSP had been started as an outcome of  an urge by our scientifc community to have a quick access to  journals specifcally devoted to materials science stream to aid  in the current research projects. In 2005, SDMSP covered 121

titles from M/s Elsevier are being subscribed for fulflling the  needs of our scientifc community. Gradually the number of  titles increased from 121 to 160 titles. Though not covering the  whole gamut of journals required for research in non-metallic  materials, most of the research requirement of our scientists  gets fulflled through SDMSP. The study has been carried out  keeping in mind the following objectives to assess the effcacy  of the service provided to our patrons: 
i.     Features  and  services  of  SDMSP  along  with  the  number  
of  journals  available  in  terms  of  paid/open  access  and  
complimentary. 
ii.   Usability  of  journals  in  terms  of  number  of  downloads  
from 2005-2015 and fle type preference of accessing the  
database. Number of downloads is actually the number of  
full-text articles downloaded from publisher website.  iii.   Most  heavily  used  and  non-utilised/less  utilised  journals  
under the SDMSP package. 
iv.  Cost per article based on the number of downloads from  
2005 to 2012. 
v.  Impact of SDMSP on the library services. 
4. MethoDoLogy 
Elsevier science direct has a separate usage report web  interface through which they provide COUNTER Compliant  reports  that  can  be  sorted,  printed,  visualised  and  exported  in  excel,  CSV  or  PDF  format.  Hence,  the  usage  reports  for  subscribed  and  complimentary  titles  from  2005-2015  were  obtained  from  science  direct  usage  report  portal12.  The  data  was then arranged to get information under appropriate head.  Sorting, Tabulation and graphical tools have been applied to  analyse the data. It is also to be noted here that presently  our  laboratory  is  having  online  access  to  more  than  200  titles  under  material  science  subject  collection  against  subscription of 160 titles. Access to remaining titles comes  under  complimentary  and  open  access  category.  For  our  study  purpose  we  have  taken  160  core  titles  of  material  science package for the sake of convenience and uniformity  of available titles in all years.  
2015 for analysing the usability of SDMSP. In 2013-2014 the  subscription of SDMSP had not been materialised. The usage  shown  in  2013  and  2014  is  actually  the  usage  of  archives,  open  access  and  complimentary  titles  available  within  that  time period. Figure 1 shows the number of downloads from  2005 - 2015 
It  is  clearly  evident  from  the  Fig.  1  that  out  of  total  downloads  the  maximum  usage  was  made  in  2009  and  minimum articles were downloaded in 2014 by our scientists.  The fgure also depicts that usage in 2006, 2013 and 2014 is  below 3000 which is very low as compared to usage of rest  of the years. The Fig. 1 also reveal that most preferred format  of download is pdf over HTML as we can see in all the years  from 2005 - 2015 most downloads were in PDF format when  compared to HTML format. The leading reason behind the fact  may be the on screen visual appearance of pdf documents is the  same as the printed version.  
5.3 Analysis  of journal titles 
To  analyse the trend  of  usage  of  journal titles we  have  divided  the  160  titles  on  the  basis  of  number  of  full  text  downloads into three groups viz group A (0-100), group B  (101-1000)  and group  C  (more  than  1000)  as  shown  in  the  Table 1. group A consists of 81 titles each of which is having  number of downloads between range 0-100, with 2346 total  downloads having 3.48 per cent usage, group B consists of  60 titles with 20911 downloads and group C contains 19 titles  with maximum 44088 full text downloads. It is worthy to note  that  the  number  of  titles  contributing  to  maximum  usage  is  65.47 per cent for group C is only 19 and vice versa. 
5.1 Science  Direct 
Science Direct is a leading full-text scientifc database  in  the  sciences,  technical  and  medical  arena  and  a  part  of Elsevier  which  publishes  over  2,500  peer  reviewed  journals as well as books and secondary databases. There  are 24 subject groups under four major subject categories  i.e. physical science and engineering, life sciences, health  sciences  and  social  sciences  and  humanities.  Materials  Science  subject  category  comes  under  physical  science  and  engineering  group  along  with  other  subjects. The  platform  offers  sophisticated  search  and  retrieval  functionality  that  enables  the  user  to  maximise  the  effectiveness  of  their  knowledge discovery process.

5.2 Usage Analysis  of  e-journals  
The basic tool to measure the usage of online journal is its  usage statistics as it provides the evidence of use by our user  community in terms of number of downloads of the journal  articles. We have taken the usage data of 11 years from 2005- 
2005-2015.

5.3.1  Journal  Titles  in  Group A 
Only 129 articles have been downloaded from 32 titles  in  sub  group  0-10  which  means  on  an  average  each  titles  has  approximately  only  4  hits  in  the  span  of  11  years  and  contributing  only  0.19  per  cent  of  the  total  usage  of  the  package. We can see the decreasing trend in number of titles  accessed while moving down the column of sub groups and  an increasing trend in number of full text downloaded except  for sub group 61-70 and 91-100. The percentage of total usage  in terms of number of full text downloads is just 3.48 per cent  from  the  titles  covering  more  than  50  per  cent  of  the  titles  available in the SDMSP strike off -presentation of Table 2.

5.3.2  Titles  in  Group  B 
group  B  ranges  from  101-1000  consisting  of  60  titles  having 20911 number of downloads and constitute 31.05 per  cent usage of the SDMSP from 2005-2015. The numbers of  titles comprise almost 40 per cent of the titles available in the  package  however  the  usage  is  not  adequate  even  from  this  group of package. Maximum usage in this group is 5.19 per  cent with 14 titles in range 201-300 with 3496 downloads. The  minimum usage i.e 923 in the group is from sub group 900- 1000,  but  on  the  other  way  it  is  the  maximum usage  as  the  number of hits comes from only one journal title and single  journal is contributing to 1.37 per cent usage of the package  Table 3. 
5.3.3  Titles  in  Group  C 
group C has titles that have more than 1000 downloads  with maximum usage of 65 per cent and minimum number of  titles i.e only 19 titles which accounts for 44088 downloads.  The data of this group is just opposite with data of group A with  minimum usage and maximum titles. The 19 titles constitute  only 11-12 per cent of the titles available in the package and  are considered the core journal titles that have been read or  downloaded extensively by our scientifc fraternity. The detail  of the individual journal titles with their respective number of  downloads is shown in Fig. 2.

It  is  evident  from  the  fgure  that  Polymer  is  the  highly  utilised  journal  among  other  journals  is  Polymer  with  7023  hits occupying 10.43 per cent of the total usage of the package  journals. Similarly Carbon and European Polymer Journal are  having 4667 and 4054 number of downloads respectively and  constitutes 12.95 per cent usage of the package journals. The  maximum usage in group C is 21.21 per cent which comes  from  11  journal  titles  having  14285  number  of  downloads.  Though this group contains the titles which gives the maximum  usage of the package but usage may be further enhanced by  conducting  orientation  programmes  by  library  and  making  users aware about the alerts services provided by personalised  access options by just registering with the website like saved  search alerts, topic alerts and journal alert for publication of  new issue. 
5.4 Analysis  of cost  per Article  of  the  Package  
journals 
The average cost per article is calculated on the basis of  number of downloads and subscription fee paid during 2005 to  2012. 2013 to 2015 are excluded from this study as in 2013- 14 the package was not subscribed and all the online journals  along with consortia journals are subscribed through a nodal  agency; DESIDOC, Delhi.

figure 2. Usage of 19 titles having more than 1000 downloads. 
The Table 5 clearly indicates that the minimum cost per  article  is  reported  in  2009  (INR  142.39)  when  the  usage  is  maximum and maximum cost per article is reported in 2006  when the usage is minimum. We have not observed any trend  in cost/article as the cost per article depends on the subscription  cost along with the number of downloads in a particular year.  The average cost per article in all the years comes to around  INR  228/-.  When  calculated  in  US$  it  will  cost  maximum  $3.30, which is quite less when compared to pay per download  option offered by the website. At the time of study the cost of  downloading a single article from any science direct journal is  US$ 31.50 per article13.Hence it is clear that pay per download  is an expensive option for our library as it may cost 10 times  more than the average cost of single article. It is also worth  mentioning that the reason for choosing package subscription  is frst our library is getting the science direct material science  package on highly discounted price, secondly the publisher is  offering access to 10 years back fles of the subscribed titles  and thirdly the package contains around 50-60 complimentary  titles. 
5.5 Impact  of  Package  on  Library  Services i. Among other material science DRDO labs, the Science  
Direct  Material  Science  Package  has  been  subscribed  
only  in  our  laboratory,  thus  literature  requirements  of  
other  DRDO  labs  are  also  being  fulflled  through  inter  
library loan services. So we can say that Inter library loan  
has increased to a great extent while users requirement of  
photocopying has decreased. 
ii. DMSRDE Technical Information centre is having a central  
national  knowledge  network  and  internet  centre  and  
approximately 400 users are visiting library every month  
for  accessing  the  online-resources  available  to  them.  
Though the frequency of visit to library has increased but  
the focus is being shifted from print to online-resources. As  
earlier users tend to visit library for reading and reference

      purposes but now most of the literature requirement of      
     our patrons gets fulflled through this package as our  
      lab is working primarily in materials science stream. iii. Library  has  initiated  a  literature  search  service  for  
its  scientists  and  provides  latest  relevant  articles  of  
interest based on the keyword provided by them. iv. The  role  of  library  has  changed  from  providing  the  
placed based services to access based services. Now  
users  prefer  getting  their  required  information  in  
digitised form on their own desktop and library tries to  
make available the requisite material through library  
portal and E-mails etc. with minimal loss of time.  
6.    c oncLUSIonS 
After  analysing  the  reports  we  can  conclude  that  usage of nearly 50 per cent of the journals titles are negligible  especially the 81 titles in group A. Out of which 32 titles are  having nil or 0-10 number of downloads in a large span of 11  years so they can be considered as nil used titles. Usage of titles  falling in Group B is also not very signifcant and contributes  only 31 per cent usage of the package in the 11 years span.  There is a common trend in every group that as the range of  number  of  downloads  increases  the  number  of  journal  titles  start declining. Consequently, the maximum usage centered on  only 19 journal titles of group C. Thus if we procure only 19  titles 65 per cent of user request can be satisfed. But this is only  one side of the coin as the prices of the journals is reaching the  sky and the subscription price of 19 journals when calculated  individually costs more than the cost of the package having  121  titles.  The  subject  packages  are  offered  on  discounted  price of approximately 90 per cent on their list price by the  publisher. Secondly we can opt for pay per view option which  is also a costly affair as average cost per article analysed in  section 4.4 is INR 228/- (US $3.35) as compared to US $31.50  (INR  2142.00)  for  each  article.  Considering  the  above  facts  we can say that purchasing the whole package is more suitable  for  our  laboratory  rather  than  to  purchase  highly  utilised  titles  individually.  The  added  advantage  is  getting  10  years  archival access free with the subscription. Library can opt for  procurement of some highly used journal titles individually if  in future, the subscription of the package may not be continued  due to any inevitable circumstance or unreasonable or irrational  price hike by the publisher. The libraries always prefer to have  a complete set of journals titles owned by them because there  is a drawback with online procurement that the moment we  stop subscribing the package for some or the other reason, we  will have nothing for perpetual access on our end neither the  access to the subscribed journal titles nor any of the archives.  The access will be available only for those titles whose print  is also being subscribed. The publishers justify their decision  by mentioning that the user get access to the content only by

paying 10 per cent of the cost so they cannot give the access to  the content everlastingly.  
There  are  many  pricing  options  available  with  the  publisher, librarians should judiciously choose the option that  is  economically  feasible  for  their  institution.  The  emphasis  should be on uninterrupted supply and post termination access  of subscribed titles for paid period of subscription. Librarians  should give proper training and educate their users for using the  online-resources and encourage them for maximum utilisation  of the subscribed resources.
