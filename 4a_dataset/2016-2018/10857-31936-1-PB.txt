ABSTRAcT 
Dengue fever is undoubtedly one of the most rapidly spread mosquito borne re-emerging infection that poses  signifcant threat to about half of the world’s population. People working in this feld have taken dengue seriously  it is refected from the continuous increasing number of publications during 1989-2015. This study is an attempt to  make a 3D bibliometric portfolio of research on dengue. This 3D bibliometric analysis portray the dengue research  through various measures quality, quantity, consistency and two secondary indicators h index and z index. The data  retrieved from the Web of Science. Number of publications increases 70 folds in given time span during 1989-2015.  Vietnam has the highest impact (quality) while India has the lowest impact among the leading countries. Taiwan  has a higher variability 0.41 (consistency ƞ), whereas Germany has a lower consistency. Walter Reed Army Institute  of Research WRAIR of USA has the highest impact (quality) while Universidade DE Sao Paulo of Brazil has the  lowest impact among the organisations in the list. University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston (USA) has a  highest consistency 0.33, whereas University of Massachusetts System (USA) has a lowest consistency (0.03).

The  incidence  of  dengue  has  grown  dramatically  around  the  world  in  recent  decade.  The  actual  numbers  of  dengue  cases  are  underreported  and  many  cases  are  mis-classified. One recent estimate indicates 390 million  dengue infections per year (95% credible interval 284–528  million), of which 96 million (67–136 million) manifest  clinically  (with  any  severity  of  disease). Another  study,  of  the  prevalence  of  dengue,  estimates  that  3.9  billion  people,  in  128  countries,  are  at  risk  of  infection  with  dengue viruses.1-3   Most  cases  occur  in  tropical  areas  of  the world, with the greatest risk occurring in the Indian  subcontinent,  Southeast  Asia,  Southern  China,  Taiwan,  The  Pacific  Islands,  The  Caribbean  (except  Cuba  and  the Cayman Islands), Mexico, Africa, Central and South  Africa  (except  Chile,  Paraguay,  and Argentina).

. analyse 2074 papers published  on different aspects of Japanese Encephelitis (JE) during  1991  to  2010  and  indexed  by  Science  Citation  Index -  Expanded.Various  studies  have  also  been  done  on  evaluation  of  research  performance  on  dengue  fever.  Kavitha and Kavitha5   studied  the  International  research  output on dengue during 2003-2012 by using PUBMED database  and  discuss  authorship  pattern  and  degree  of  collaboration. Zyoud6  studied the publications on dengue  research  for  worldwide  and  for  Arab,  data  for  this  study was taken from SCoPUS   database  for  the  period  1872-2015. Bharadwaj7  did scientometric assessment on  dengue research for the period 2001 to 2012 and data for  this  study  was  taken  from  Scopus  database.  Ho8, et  al. examined the relationship between the burden of dengue  
Received 03 November 2016, online published 09 May 2017 
and  scientific  publications  and  quoted  that  there  was  little  information  on  the  bibliometric  trend  and  patterns  of  dengue  research  globally  by  using  SCI-  Expanded  database  for  the  period  1991-2014.  
Dutt9, et al. studied global dengue research between  1987  and  2008.  Data  downloaded  for  this  study  from  web  of  science.  80%  of  the  papers  were  published  by  scientists based (in decreasing rank order) in the United  States,  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Netherlands,  France,  and  Germany. 
Earlier, Prathap10-11  had used simple heuristic model  using  2D  quantity  (productivity  in  terms  of  number  of  publications) and quality (the citation per paper). Further  he  extended  his  work  to  3D  model  by  adding  third  dimension  called  consistency  (ƞ).  This  3D  evaluation  tools  enhance  the  information  production  process12.   Number  of  papers  (P)  denotes  quantity  and  citation  per  paper  (C/P)  denotes  quality  (or  impact  i)  where,  C  is  the  citation  that  received  by  papers  (P).  The  new  third  dimension,  consistency  (ƞ)  describes  the  variability  in  the  quality  of  the  individual  papers  in  the  publication  set  or  the  shape  of  the  distribution  curve.  The  accurate  calculation  of  consistency  (ƞ)  requires  the  complete  citation sequence, (i.e., the distribution curve) for country,  organisation, author or journal. Leydesdorff and Shin13  for  the  first  time  applied  the  new  method  for  the  fractional  attribution  of  citations  to  the  study  of  a  grouping  such  as  universities  as  institutional  units  of  analysis.  They  harvested publication data (2005-2007) and citation data  (2009)  for  seven  Korean  research  universities  from  the  Science  Citation  Index-Expanded,  the  Social  Science

Citation Index  ( SSCI), and the  Arts & Humanities Citation  
C is derived from complete citation sequence, cj   of  
Index  ( A&HCI)  combined  at  web-interface  of  the ISI- the citation of each paper in a publication portfolio of P  
Web  of  Science  ( WoS).  
By  using  all  the  three  components  quantity,  quality  and consistency, Prathap12   calculated  a  z-index  with  the  help  of  composite  indicator  named  Zynergy.  
Z= ɳX= ɳ2E  as  z=Z1/3      
X=  Exergy 
E=  Energy 
This approach based on ‘thermodynamic’ considerations  that  can  quantify  research  performance  using  an  exergy  term  defined  as  X  =  iC,  where  i  is  the  impact  and  C  is  the number of citations, where fractionalised counting of  
papers as the total number of citations, C=∑cj, for j=1 to  P.    Both  P  and  C  serve  as  indicators  of  performance  in  their  respective  ways. As  C=ίP  may  be  assumed  as  the  first  order  indicator  for  performance.  Pratap  mentioned  the exergy indicator X=ί2P, is energy like quantity which  explained as second order indicator of performance. This  model  leads  to  trinity  of  energy-  like  terms.12,14 
X  =  ί2P,  E  =  Σc2j ,  S  =  Σ  (cj-ί)2   =  E-X. 
Wheres 
P=  Σpj,  C=  Σcj,  ί=C/P 
The  h-index  is  observed  by  ordering  the  citation  in  
citations is used instead of integer counting and Energy  a decreasing sequence15. Highly cited papers are seen to  
defined  as  E=ΣC2j  . 
This study is an attempt which shows 3-D evaluation  of dengue research output published in scholarly journal  listed  by  Web  of  Science  database  for  the  period  1989  to  2015.  Web  of  science  provide  facility  to  refine  the  
be  concentrated  in  a  small  region,  possibility  of  huge  variation  in  the  quality  of  papers  in  the  publication  set. Accordings to Prathap10,  in  case  of  high  skews,  the  product  X=iC=i2P,  which  is  a  second-order  indicator  is  a better proxy for performance than C itself. Apart from  
research output on various scales like publications year,  
X,  an  additional  indicator  E  also  appears  as  a  second- 
order  indicator  as  seen  above.  The  existence  of  both  
countries, organisations, authors and journals (source titles)  etc. In this study author examined the leading countries,  leading  organisations,  leading  authors,  leading  subfield,  leading  journals  of  dengue  research  by  following  3D  evaluations  tools  (Quality,  Quantity  and  Consistency).

InDIcATORS 
In  this  performance  evaluation  age  it  is  topic  of  debate that which indicators show performance precisely  of  scientific  output  of  an  individual  or  an  entity.  The  journal  impact  factor  is  now  symbolised  as  a  proxy  or  indirect  measure  of  the  quality  or  scholarly  influence  of  a  journal.  Scientific  performance  of  individual  or  an  entity  can  be  measured  by  using  different  parameters. 
2.1.  Quantity 
Number  of  papers/articles  ‘P’  published  during  a  
proxies  X  and  E  allows  to  introduce  third  proxy  named  as  consistency  (variability)  ƞ=X/E.  When  X=E,  i.e.,  ƞ=1,  the  condition  indicates  for  the  perfect  consistency  means  uniform  performance  (all  papers  have  the  same  number  of  citations,  cj=c).  The  inverse  of  consistency  gives  the  concentration  of  best  work  in  few  papers  of  extraordinary impact. Thus, for a complete 3-D evaluation  of publication activity, one needs P, i, and ƞ. These  are  the  three  primary  components  of  a  quantity-quality- consistency  landscape. 
3.  MeThODOlOGy  
Scientific  output  on  the  Dengue  fever  searched  on Web  of  Science   (a  Thomson  Reuters  Product).  Data  extracted on topic=(Dengue fever) for the period 1989- 2015 covering Science Citation index –Expanded, Social  Science Citation Index, Art and Humanities Index in this  
prescribed  window  will  be  called  publication  window  
study.  Data  downloaded  in  Excel  sheets  according  to  
various parameters needed for study. From all the related  
(for  this  study  the  window  is  from  1989  to  2015).    
2.2.  Quality 
Quality denotes citation per paper, calculated as C/P  where  C  is  the  number  of  citations  during  a  prescribed  citation  window.  The  quality  measurement  needed  two  separate windows, the publication window and the citation  window.  
In 3D evaluation of performance measurement after  computing  quantity  P  and  quality  ί  parameters,  it  is  possible  to  derive  other  indicators  by  following  these  sequences.  
P=  ί0P  (Zeroth   indicator) 
C=  ί1P  (first  order  indicator) 
X=  ί2P = ί1C  =  ί  (Second  order  indicator) 
C  =  Σcj,   j = 1 to P 
articles  P  and  Citation  C  are  computed  for  this  study.  Then all the indicators quality, quantity, consistency for  leading  countries,  leading  institution,  leading  authors,  leading  journal    are  counted  on  excel  sheets. 
By  using  all  the  three  indicators  together,  z  index  can be calculated from an energy like term (Z=ɳX= ɳ2E).  This z index is the combination of quantity, quality and  consistency  (or  efficiency),  provide  truly  3D  evaluation  of scholarly publications. It may be assumed P, ί and ɳ  as  primary  indicators  and  h  and  z  index  are  secondary,  composite  indicators.

4.1. Growth 
Figure 1 clearly indicates the rising trend of dengue  research  as  the  need  of  time.  Dengue  research  with  10  publications in 1989 gradually increases and becomes 796  publications in 2015. It is observed that paper published  during the period 1989-1998 was less than 100 every year.  Table  1  shows  the  variation  of  the  world’s  publications  and  citations  with  publication  year.  Table  1  shows  maximum 501 papers published in 2011 interminted. The  list with the year 2011, as articles, articles proceedings,  reviews, letter and notes of more recent origin would not  have  had  enough  time  to  collect  a  reasonable  number  of  citations.  A  five-year  citation  window  is  considered  to  be  reasonable  from  this  point  of  view.

Dengue research are enormously scattered in various  subdisplines.  Table 5 indicates top leading subfields with  
their no of publications, citations, all the three indicators  quantity,  quality,  consistency  with  h  index  and  z  index.  It shows that as obvious infectious disease (1380) is on  the  first  rank  followed  by  tropical  medicine  (1338)  and  Virology (1185), whereas impact wise distribution of this  table gives the first rank to virology. Subfield Biotechnology  and Applied  Microbiology  shows  maximum  consistency  in  given  list. Virology  has  maximum  h  and  z-index.
