Many online learning repositories available around the world. This paper provides a comparative analysis  among selected online learning repositories (eGyankosh, ePG pathshala, MIT resources and Sodhganga) for learning  resources. The comparative study is based on some analytical parameters, like generic, content related, retrieval  related, post processing, interface related, etc. The collected data have been analysed on the basis of parameters.  The results have been displayed through different types of diagrams like multiple bar diagrams, pie diagram, etc.  It was found that none of the selected online learning repositories achieved the full score. And also found that  
Sodhganga ranked the highest position among them.

1.  IntROduCtIOn 
There  are  various  types  of  online  learning  resources  available  on  the  Internet.  Use  of  electronic  information  has  increased with the rapid advancement of internet and its related  technologies.  Now  internet  is  an  effective  communication  medium  enabling  collaboration  and  interaction  between  individuals and their computers regardless of their geographical  barrier.  The  development  of  the  world  wide  web  has  led  to  tremendous growth in the quantity of all types of publications.  Presently  the  web  is  a  reliable  and  effective  mechanism  for  dissemination  of  information.  The  web  has  surrounded  a  variety of information resources, such as, electronic journals  (e-journals),  educational  materials,  technical  reports,  library  catalogues (OPAC), databases, career sources, information on  organisations, associations and many more1.  
  To  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  growth  of  information,  libraries  are  re-innovating  themselves.  They  must  provide  well equipped environment for information seekers with many  options, time saving by use of different types of Information  and communication technology. While most of the libraries are  trying to publish their digital resources on web very fast, they  are also taking steps to make their online learning repositories  and reference services available digitally. Few digital reference  services incorporate e-mails, instant messaging (online chat),  and  telephone  have  been  in  use  for  decades,  while  other  services  such  as  text  messaging  and  video  conferencing  are  emerged in the last decade2.  
Digital  reference  service  is  considered  as  an  online  reference  service  for  library  patrons  to  query  reference  information on library’s website. Unlike traditional reference,  
Received : 15 February 2018, Revised : 23 April 2018 Accepted : 11 May 2018, Online published : 25 June 2018 
digital  reference  service  allows  patrons  to  submit  questions  and receive answer via the internet or other electronic means3. Therefore,  the  digital  reference  sources  should  be  strong  in  nature to render services to the tech-savvy users.  
Online  learning  repositories  are  one  of  the  method  of  digital reference sources for learning resources. Some of major  online learning repositories studied here are eGyankosh, JISC  resources, MIT resources, CEC UGC resources ePG Pathshala,  Sodhganga4.  
2.  LItERAtuRE REVIEW 
Singh5  studied the comparative digital reference services  of  north  Indian  academic  libraries.  The  various  models  of  providing  digital  reference  services  such  as  email,  “Ask  questions”,  video  conferencing,  digital  robots,  online  chat  reference  and  collaborative  digital  reference  were  discussed  in his research. He also discussed the strength and weakness  of existing reference service being provided by the university  libraries.  To  complete  the  research  he  used  the  observation  method  of  study  to  explore  the  websites  of  the  above  universities.  An  evaluation  criteria  was  used  to  collect  the  relevant data and the collected data were tabulated, analysed  and interpreted to compare the present digital reference service  of the above selected universities. 
Kumah6   compared  the  use  of  Internet  and  library  of  graduate  students  in  the  University  of  Ghana. A  convenient  sampling  technique  was  used  to  select  the  sample  for  the  study.  93.3  per  cent  of  the  respondents  answered  positive  regarding their use of library; 98.8 per cent of the respondents  use Internet; and lastly Other source of information used by  the graduate students which includes media, interaction with  experts, etc. It was found in his study that 72 per cent of the  
259

DJLIT,  VOL.  38,  NO.  4,  JULy  2018 
respondents use Internet and library. He recommended in his  study that the library should be upgraded to meet requirements  of the users.  
Akor & Alhassan1  discussed the evaluation of reference  services  in  academic  libraries  in  Nigeria.  The  research  refected about the questions about available reference service  which includes answering reference queries, digital reference  service, referral service; extent of providing reference service  which includes provision for reference materials, provision for  thesis and dissertation, provision for photocopying; adequacy  of  reference  service  which  includes  reference  sources  such  as encyclopedia, dictionaries, manuals, maps, etc. and fnally  users perceptions about reference service which includes helps  to users, information retrieval aids, provide right information  at  the  right  time,  satisfaction  of  information  needs.  He  also  recommended  for  the  library  users  in  keeping  of  adequate  reference materials, continuous training of reference librarians,  Student  awareness  service,  provision  of  current  awareness  services and selective dissemination of information (SDI).  
Farmer8  has found that reference sources are two types,  i.e., print format and electronic format. Both the formats are  complement with each other. Now the print format becomes  costlier than electronic format. Though the electronic resources  have some limitations regarding the connectivity and other in- frastructure issues, privacy  and  security, access  and  dissemi- nation rights, vendor problem, etc. He discussed in his research,  the selection process and polices of digital reference sources  which includes scope, arrangement, ease of use, purpose, audi- ence and authority. He also mentioned some additional criteria  for the selection of reference source which includes interface,  readability, fle transferability, technical requirements and li- censing  agreements.  In  the  life  cycle  of  electronic  resource  management  part,  he  explained  about  pre-planning,  acquisi- tion, licensing, web presentation, usage, maintenance, preser- vation and archiving and review of digital reference source. 
2.1  egyankosh 
eGyankosh is a National Digital Repository. In October  2005,  Indira  Gandhi  National  Open  University  (IGNOU)  initiated  the  development  of  a  knowledge  repository  of  online  learning  resources  for  storing,  indexing,  preserving,  disseminating  and  sharing  the  digital  learning  resources  developed by the open and distance learning (ODL) institutions  in the country (India). At present, e-learning is more advanced  and dynamic concepts of social networking, personal learning  environments  and  mobile  learning  rather  than  a  content  repository  and  emulating  classroom  teaching  by  using  ICT  applications. It is an online learning environment for distance  learners9. 
2.2  e-Pg   Pathshala 
In  September,  2011,  The  Ministry  of  Human  Resource  Development  (MHRD),  Government  of  India  has  started  a  valuable  project,  National  Mission  on  Education  through  Information  and  Communication  Technology  (NME- ICT)  to  initiate  and  to  accelerate  the  ICT  –  enabled  Higher  education10. 
Primarily, NME-ICT has Sanction to produce of e-content  
260 
in  77  subjects  for  postgraduate  level.  It  was  proposed  to  create  and  maintain  the  e-contents  with  high  quality  based  on  curriculum  and  syllabus  interactively  in  various  subjects  in all disciplines like natural & mathematical sciences, social  sciences,  arts,  fne  arts  &  humanities,  and  linguistics  and  languages.  The  developed  e-contents  are  available  in  open  access and also accessible through Sakshat Portal . 
2.3  MIt  R ESOuRCES 
In  April  2001,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT)  initiated  a  project  named  “MIT  Open  Course  Ware  (MIT  OCW)”  to  publish  MIT  course  materials  on  web.   3369  Courses  were  published  by  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology (MIT) till Nov. 2017. In 2005. Open Course Ware  Consortium was started with aim to access the course materials  over Internet and to develop online system for the publication of  open course materials. The MIT OpenCourse Ware was funded  and suppoted by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,  theAndrew W. Mellon Foundation, and MIT11. 
2.4  Shodhganga 
The  Shodhganga  is  project,  initiated  by  Information  and  Library  Network  (INFLIBNET)  center,  Ahmedabad.  It  is  a  digital  institutional  repository  containing  of  theses  and  dissertations  from  Indian  Universities.  In  June  2009,  the  University Grants Commission (UGC) has made a mandatory  regulations  for  all  universities  to  submit  soft  copies  of  PhD  theses and MPhil dissertations to the UGC for hosting in the  INFLIBNET  (Information  and  Library  Network).  The  357  universities  and  14  Centrally  Funded  Technical  Institutes  (CFTI) in India are taken membership through MoUs with the  INFLIBNET Centre to participate in the Shodhganga project12.  The Shodhganga@INFLIBNET  is  set-up  and  implemented  by using free and open source software called Dspace (http:// www.dspace.org). According to the notifcation of the UGC,  it is mandatory that every researcher of all Indian universities  have  to  submit  the  soft  copy/e-version  of  their  theses  and  dissertations  for  availability  as  open  access  to  Indian  theses  and dissertations to the academic community world-wide. 
3.  ObjECtIVES Of thE Study

4.1  Analysis  and  Interpretation 
Table  1 reveals  the  availability  of  online  learning  repositories 
Generic parameters for evaluation of any online learning  repositories  are  the  most  valuable  criteria.  The  Table  2 narrates  the  generic  parameters.  This  parameter  includes  scope and coverage, vendor/publisher viability, frequency of  update, distribution policy, authentication of primary sources,  availability  of  local  subscription  agent,  copyright  and  other  legal  issues,  facility  of  replacement,  hardware  and  software  compatibility, data access speed and cost of data base.  
From  the  Table  2,  it  is  shown  ePG  Pathshala,  MIT  resources and Sodhganga scored equal (maximum), i.e. 07 and  eGyankosh scored lowest, i.e. 05 out of 11.  
Content is always the key factor of any online learning  repositories.  This  parameter  focuses  the  following  Table  3  reveals the content related parameter. This parameter focuses  on extent of coverage, coverage of time span, completeness of

individual records, use of standard encoding formats, use of  standard record structure and application of standard tools in  information organisation. 
Table  3 shows  that  maximum  score  06  was  achieved  by Sodhganga where as minimum score 04 was achieved by  eGyankosh,  ePG  Pathshala  and  MIT  resources  each  in  this  category. 
Retrieval of information is most important thing for the  evaluation of online learning repositories. The Table 4 reveals  retrieval  related  parameters.  This  parameter  includes  index  related factorssuch as  - browse index, number of posting, cross- reference and thesaurus (integrated); search structure related  factor such  as   -  item  selection  form  index,  term  selection  from record, case sensitivity, search types and combine search  facility;  search  features such  as  -  availability  of  boolean  operator, availability of relational operator, positional search  operator and truncation facility, truncation facility, proximity  operators,  range  search,  feld  level  search,  and  use  of  fuzzy

logic; search profle such as - speed of performance, facility of  saved search, search status, search set management, availability  of  display  formats,  display  control,  search  history  display,  search modifcation facility and Search statistics facility. Table  4 shows that maximum score was achieved by Sodhganga, i.e.,  19 out of 26, followed by MIT resources and eGyankosh (13  out of 26) and ePG Pathshala scored the lowest, i.e., (7 out of  26). 
The  Table  5 reveals the  post  processing  parameters.  This parameter refects downloading facility, printing facility,  integration  facility,  facility  to  control  number  of  felds  in  transfer and choice of data transfer format such as - simple text,  CSV fle, MARC / UNIMARC Format, ISO format and Export  facility. In the Table 5 it is found that the maximum score 05  out  of  09  achieved  by  Sodhganga  where  as  MIT  resources  scored 03 out of 09 and eGyankosh and ePG Pataskala scored  04 each out of 09 in this category. 
For  evaluation  of  any  online  learning  repositories  database, Interface always plays a vital role. The next table,  Table 6narrates the interface related parameters. This parameter  includes operational parameterssuch as input option (keyboard,  mouse and others), facility to break search or processing, facility  to use online thesaurus, saving of search profle for future use  and option to exit/escape/abort; navigational parameters such  as  navigation  between  records,  navigation  within  records,  hyper based navigation outside the system or web, navigation  in thesaurus or other vocabulary control device and Navigation  through  term  dictionary;  communication  parameters such  as  standard terminology, screen layout, consistency in prompts,  menus  and  help  massages,  novice  and  expert  user  interface,  facility to change theme/appearance, multilingual option and  consistency  in  use  of  terminology;  support  parameters such  as online help, online tutorial, and appropriate error massage  with instruction to solve access problems. From the Table 6, it  is seen that Sodhganga scored the maximum 14, followed by  eGyankosh, MIT resources and ePG Pathshala.  
Table 7 contains the all parameters with its score values  for  the  comparative  statement  of  evaluation  study.  It  shows  that the Sodhganga has scored highest i.e. 51. eGyankosh has  ranked second and MIT resources are in third position.  
From  the  Table  8,  displaying  the  total  scores,  scores  obtained and the percentage of all different primary parameters  of  all  databases.  None  of  them  has  met  the  full  scores. The

The  generic  parameters  has  ranked 2nd  position and the interface related parameters is at  last position. It has been seen that the total maximum score is  288 of all parameters, i.e. generic parameters, content related  parameters,  retrieval  related  parameters,  post  processing  parameters, interface related parameters. They have achieved  only 148 scores i.e. 51.39 per cent.  
Table  9  contains  the  felds  like  score  obtained,  total  score,  percentage  of  parameters  and  ranking  of  all  online  learning  repositories.  The  ‘total  score’  indicates  the  sum  of  all  maximum  scores  of  all  parameters  (generic  parameters,  content related parameters, retrieval related parameters, post  processing  parameters,  interface  related  parameters)  of  each  database. The ‘Score Obtained’ indicates the sum of obtained  scores of all parameters. The Sodhganga database has achieved  the highest score, i.e. 51 (70.83 %) and ranked frst position.  The eGyankosh, MIT Resources, and ePG Pathsala have got  36 (50 %), 34 (47.22 %), 27 (37.5 %), respectively. None of the  online learning repositories achieved the maximum scores for  parameters related to evaluation. The ranks clearly indicate the  requirement of further development of repositories. 
4.2  Suggestions  and  Recommendations 
At the end of the study, it seems that following suggestions  and  recommendations  may  be  incorporated  for  further  development of online learning repository: 
• The distribution policy is an important parameter for the  
evaluation of every learning repository, but every learning  
resource  lacks  distribution  policy.  So  there  should  be  a  
clear distribution policy for every repository; 
• Each  and  every  repository  should  have  standard  record  
structure and a standard encoding format; 
• There should be combined search facility in case of every  
repository; 
• There should be integration facility for every repository; • There must be data transfer format; 
• Navigation  from  one  record  to  another  is  very  much  
fruitful in time searching any information. There should  
be navigation facility in every repository; 
• Online help, online tutorial and appropriate error massage  
must be there.
