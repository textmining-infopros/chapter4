ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of various services and facilities provided by Muffakham Jah  College of Engineering and Technology Library, Hyderabad, India. This study used survey method and questionnaire  tool for data collection. The majorities of the respondents in this study choose print form of textbooks (78 %) and  printed reference books (80.33 %). Of the total, 80 per cent of them stated that they did not fnd any gaps in library  collections. It was found that most of them (93.33 %) do not fnd any problems and issues in accessing information  from the available resources. The majority (89 %) of them agreed with the working hours and 81.67 per cent of  the respondents are satisfed with the services offered by the library staff. Over three fourths (78.67 %) of them are  satisfed with the existing facilities provided by the library. The majority (89 %) of the respondents indicated that  the library should have a separate website in addition to the college website.

Evaluation of library services  
1. INTRODUCTION 
Satisfying users’ needs is the prime aim of the engineering  college library1. Libraries assist in research process including  collecting,  organizing  and  preserving  information  resources  applicable  to  the  research  community.  Today,  engineers  need  business  skills,  communication  skills,  personality,  business ethics, etc. thus, engineering institutes have a greater  accountability to shape and offer prospects for all engineering  students.  Teachers,  laboratories  and  most  importantly  the  libraries have a greater role in imparting required knowledge,  skills and thereby shaping the career of engineers2. The main  objectives  of  engineering  libraries  are  to  assist  engineering  students  in  acquiring  knowledge  and  updating  their  skills.  Libraries  encourage  teachers,  scientists,  researchers  and  students  beyond  their  classroom  instruction  and  research.  Furthermost, the role of the engineering college library is to  gather and consolidate information to meet the requirements  of these students. 
In the present scenario, it is mandatory to keep documents  in the conventional as well as digital form for wider access.  Satao3   noticed  that  libraries  have  undergone  a  distinct  transformation  in  recent  years  in  term  of  collections  and  services offered. This study is undertaken to examine the needs  of users and understanding their awareness about existing print  and non-print resources, services and facilities provided by the  library. 
2.  BACKGROUND 
Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology  (MJCET)  was  setup  in  the  year  1980  by  Sultan-ul-uloom

Education Society, Hyderabad. It is affliated to the Osmania  University, Hyderabad and recognised by AICTE, New Delhi.  The MJCET library occupies over 1000 sq.m. area. The library  has a rich collection of books and journals; 52,258 volumes of  books and subscribing 125 printed magazines and journals. It  has  a  reading  room  facility  which  accommodates  about  175  users. The digital library is having 25 IBM workstations and  linked  with  1  MBPS  Internet  capacity;  subscribing AICTE- INDEST consortium online E-Journals databases such as IEEE,  ASCE, ASME, and Science Direct. All the Library operations  are computerised using SOUL software. 
3.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Developments  in  information  technology  (IT)  during  recent  times  have  changed  the  methods  and  techniques  of  gathering,  storing,  organizing  information  particularly  accessing,  retrieving  and  using  information.  This  has  also  reduced  the  communication  gap  between  publishing  and  delivering time. Engineering college libraries need to provide  up-to-date information for the effective teaching and research.  The main purpose of students visiting the library is for their  academic work. The majority of the users consider textbooks,  magazines, journals, and newspapers as their main sources for  collecting information5. 
Collection building is a part of the library management  process.  Collection  development  should  be  linked  to  the  information  requirements  of  that  institute6.  Collection  development  comprises  of  selection,  ordering  and  building  collection7 in all forms. Many studies have been conducted to  examine the effective use of electronic resources in different  types of libraries. Most of the users of e-resources felt that they  have saved time while using electronic resources8  compared

to  print-based  materials.  Research  studies  on  the  usage  of  electronic materials claimed that 78 per cent of the respondents  considered  in  using  UgC  –  Infonet  e-journals  which  are  important for their research and studies9.  
The  majority  (69.15  %)  of  the  students  and  faculties  of  Punjab  Engineering  College  were  unaware  about  the  e-resources  in  the  library10. Ali11 found  that  the  majority  (60  %) of customers were facing numerous complications while  using e-resources. Lohar & Kumbar12 revealed that the absence  of information, information overload, time, non-availability of  IT infrastructure, lack of space, non-availability of up-to-date  journals13, the absence of qualifed staff and not giving proper  training  were  some  of  the  problems  in  the  optimal  use  of  information resources14. Libraries have transformed tremendous  changes from traditional to digital in term of building collection  and services15. Rapid developments in library operations and  services demand to user studies in libraries to fulfll the user’s  requirements16. A Canadian Ug  library use study found that  students  who  participate  in  class  activities  and  who  study  more are dynamic library users17. Most of the students used  library for assignments, presentations, project works, research  and various other related reasons18. The prime aim of library’s  user study is to introduce new services or improve the existing  services that will satisfy library users19. 
4.  AIM AND   OBJECTIVES 
The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  evaluate  the  use  of  various  services  and  facilities  provided  by  Muffakham  Jah  College  of  Engineering  and  Technology  Library,  Hyderabad.  The  objectives of the study are:  
• To fnd out the frequency of library use by their users;  • To  examine  library  collections  and  identify  the  gaps  in  
library collection, services and facilities;  
• To examine use of the digital library;  
• To evaluate services provided by the library staff; and  • To measure the overall use of library resources. 
5.  METHODOLOGY 
This project used survey method and questionnaire tool  for data collection because it is easy to collect data without  much resources. A total of 350 structured questionnaires were  distributed  to  the  students  of  MJCET  covering  all  branches.  Of the total, 300 flled-in questionnaires were received so the  response  rate  is  (85.71  %).  The  questionnaire  comprises  of  questions  on  their  personal  profle,  department,  gender,  age,  qualifcation,  library  collections,  information  access,  library  services, library facility, digital library, library staff, problems  encountered  and  overall  evaluation.  Based  on  the  analysis,  the subsequent results have been drawn and presented in the  following sections. 
5.1 Scope  and  Limitations 
This study is confned to MJCET, Hyderabad to examine  the existing infrastructure and facilities provided by the library.  The survey covers all Ug  and P g  students and faculty members  of the department of computer science and engineering, civil  engineering,  electrical  engineering,  mechanical  engineering,  production engineering, information technology, instrumental  
engineering and electronic and communication engineering. 
The  total  number  of  students  enrolled  in  the  library  is  over 3000 and the number varies each year. While selecting  the sample size equal numbers of users are not taken from both  genders. Of the total population, a small sample of 10 per cent  students and faculty members are chosen for their study. 
6.  DATA ANALYSIS AND  INTERPRETATIONS 
As indicated before a total of 300 structured and flled- in questionnaires were collected from the students of MJCET  covering all branches. The data is analysed and the following  tables are drawn for easy understanding. 
6.1  Personal  Details 
Of the total, about a ffth (19.33 %) of the respondents  belongs to Computer science and engineering, 14.66 per cent  belongs to civil engineering, 14.33 per cent belong to electrical  engineering, 14.02 per cent belongs to mechanical engineering,  12 per cent belongs to production engineering, 11.33 per cent  belongs to it, 7.33 per cent belongs to instrumental engineering,  and  7.01  per  cent  belongs  to  electronic  &  communication  engineering.  In  this  survey,  73.33  per  cent  respondents  are  males, so males outnumbered to female respondents. 
Table 1 gives the respondents by their age. Of the total,  fourth-ffths (84.01 %) of the respondents belong to 20-22 years.  Over one-tenth (11.33 %) of them come from 18-19 years and  4.66 per cent belong to 22-23 years. This data shows that the  majority (84.01 %) of the students are doing their engineering  courses at the age of 20-22 years. Of the total, the majority  (68  %)  of  them  are  undergraduate  students.  Less  than  one- third (31.67 %) of them are postgraduates and 0.33 per cent of  them are faculty members. In general, most of the engineering  colleges offer more Ug  courses and very few P g  courses so  the same percentage refected in the sample size also.

DJLIT, VOL.  38,  NO.  2,  MARCH   2018 
Then  these  respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  their  frequency of visit to the library. One third (33 %) of them visits  the library once in a fortnight. About one-ffth (20.33 %) of  them visits the library everyday, 13.33 per cent of them visited  once in a month.  It shows that 70.01 per cent of the visitors  visit the library once in a fortnight which is a good sign to the  library. A similar study done by gunasekera16  found that more  than half (59.5 %) of the users visited daily as compared to  20.33 per cent users in this study. Of the total, 13.33 per cent  of them stated that the library is not in a convenient location  so they do not go to the library regularly. As suggested (13.33  %) by some of them, the library has now moved to the main  building which is accessible to all the students so that problem  is taken care by the college. 
Table 2 gives the reasons for not visiting the library. Of the  total, 56.33 per cent of the respondents do not visit the library  because of poor collections and poor services. Overall, 15.33  per cent do not visit the library as they do not have time and  14.67 per cent do not visit the library because of poor facilities.  This  clearly  indicates  that  the  library  needs  to  improve  its  collections, services and facilities to attract the users. Based on  this study, adequate space for reading is provided, collections  were strengthened in all branches of engineering and a digital  library,  service  was  started  and  the  existing  services  were  improved.

6.2  Library  Collections 
Table 3 shows that the majority (78 %) of the respondents  prefers to the print form of textbooks and 80.33 per cent of them  prefer to print form of reference books. Research conducted by  Kabiraj & Roy20  found that 56.15 per cent of the user’s preferred  print form of textbooks. A study undertaken by Alade, Iyoro &  Amusa21  discovered that textbooks and reference sources are  frequently used (32 %) than other formats followed by journals  (32 %). In this study, half (55.33 %) of the respondents prefers  print  forms  of  journals.  Similarly  in  another  study  also  the  majority (78.2 %) of the users preferred print form of journals  than  e-journals16.  It  is  found  that  another  half  (50.33  %)  of  them  preferred  print  form  of  reports. Alade21,   et  al.  noticed  that 34 per cent of the users’ preferred print forms compared to  electronic sources (28 %) and 38 per cent of them prefer both  print and electronic sources. Though all youth are pro-digital,  it is surprising to notice that print forms of the documents are  still accepted by the younger generation, despite availability of  e-collections and digital library.

The majority (80 %) of them stated that they did not fnd  any gaps in library collections, only one-ffth (20 %) of them  stated that there are gaps in the library collections. This shows  that respondents are satisfed with library collections. They also  stated that most of the time required books are unavailable in  the library for issue, also suggested to purchase foreign author  textbooks and subscription to the latest research reports. It is  because  the  majority  of  the  students  of  this  college  depend  upon the library for getting their textbooks.  
6.3  Information Access 
Table  4  shows  that  the  most  (93.33  %)  of  them  stated  that they do not fnd any problems or issues in accessing the  available resources. This data justify that the library has taken  utmost care to make the available resources easily reachable  to all the users. The majority (83 %) of the respondents are  not satisfed with the currently available resources as most of  the  wanted  resources  are  either  not  available  or  issued  out.  Kabiraj & Roy20  study found that less than half (40.96 %) of  the users noticed that the books listed in the catalogue are not  available for issue or reading. Based on their experience, many  of the students expressed that there are 10 or more copies of  textbooks available to each title, but the demand is more due  to increased intake of students in each branch of engineering  course, therefore suggested to go for more number of copies.

6.4  Library  Services 
Of the total, 72.33 per cent of the respondents rated good  and very good with regard to circulation services. The majority  (73.67  %)  of  them  rated  as  good  and  very  good  about  the  reference services. gunasekera16  study shows that (95.2 %) of  the users visited the library for referring reference books. Of  the total, over two-ffth (42.67%) of the respondents rated as  ‘not  up  to  my  expectation’  and  ‘not  at  all  acceptable’  about  photocopying service. A similar study was done on the use of  photocopying service established that the most (93.3%) of the  students used this service to circulate their study materials16.  From this data, it is clear that respondents are satisfed with  circulation  and  reference  services,  but  photocopying  service  is not up to the mark so it has to be improved to satisfy the  users. Due to heavy users, there is a delay in delivering service

immediately so the rating is a bit low. The majority (89%) of  them feel that the working hours of the library are suitable. Of  the total, over two thirds (73.33%) have not faced any problems  while issuing the books. (Table 5) 
6.5  Library  Facilities 
Of the total, over half (58.67%) of the respondents rated  low   about  photocopying  service  available  in  the  library  and  require improvement in term of service. The majority (72%) of  them stated that laser printing facility need to be introduced in  the new library building. Of the total, 71.67 per cent indicated  that  scanning  facility  should  be  introduced  and  also  65.33  per cent of them felt that the spiral binding facility should be  introduced in the library. Close to half (45.67%) of them rated  that printing of past exam question papers needs to be provided   and 58 per cent of them stated that past exam papers should  be in e-form available on their library website so that they can  print them easily. It is clear that most of the required facilities  are not available so requesting to consider in introducing in  the new library building. The majority (66.33%) of them are  satisfed  with  the  seating  capacity  provided  by  the  library.  Whereas,  33.67  per  cent  of  the  respondents  have  suggested  to add more seats to accommodate all the users in the library.  (Table 6). 
Two ffth (40.67%) of the respondents were not satisfed  with the photocopy facilities and therefore rated it as not up to  the mark. Of the total, 34.66 per cent of them rated as average,  23 per cent rated as good  and 1.67 per cent rated as  very good. It  is clear that photocopying facility is very poor  and library staff  should pay more attention to satisfy the user’s requirements.  The poor rating is because of the delay in delivering the work.  Many  times  all  students  come  together  for  photocopies,  but  the work is done as per queue order and that leads to delay  in  delivering  of  the  photocopies  to  the  students  on  time.  Photocopying is one of the services provided by the library. Of  the total, the majority (72%) is not happy with the price paid  for photocopying in the library and most of them feel paying  more  for  photocopying. The  library  staff  should  ensure  that  library services are not to run for proft, but provide services

cost to cost to users. Over half (56.33%) of the respondents  are willing to do photocopy on their own if such provision is  made. Of the total, 51 per cent are willing to pay for both good  and bad copies however, it is the responsibility of the library to  provide good quality photocopies at a reasonable cost. 
6.6  Digital  Library 
Of  the  total,  the  majority  (72%)  of  them  are  aware  of  the  digital  library  facility  located  in  the  computer  science  department. Most of the respondents used digital library for  doing their projects, assignments, seminars, reading journals,  checking mail, viewing company profles, looking for placement  opportunities and checking for results. Over half (54.67%) of  the respondents indicated that they did not face problems while  using digital library. Of the total, 45.33 per cent of them faced  problems while using digital library. The problems faced while  using digital library include an inadequate number of systems,  limited seating capacity and slow internet connection so these  issues  should  be  addressed  immediately  to  satisfy  the  end  users. Now, the digital library is moved inside the main library  so all these problems are taken care.  
To make optimum use of the library resources, it is proposed  to offer training to users of the library. Of the total, more than  half (51.33 %) of them are willing to attend training and less  than half (48.33 %) of them are not interested. It is clear that  respondents are willing to learn to use the resources through  library  training.  The  reasons  for  not  attending  the  training  programme  and  also  identify  the  ways  and  means  through  which they acquire skills to use the library resources should  be examined in another study. Different individuals have given  different time frames for attending library training, overall, an  average of 15 hours training per semester is suggested by these  respondents. 
6.7  Library  Staff 
The majority (81.67%) of the respondents are satisfed with  the services rendered by the library staff in getting the requested  textbooks. Of the total, 18.33 per cent of the respondents felt  that they do not receive the requested textbooks on time.

(percentage) Highly cooperative 62 (20.67) Very cooperative 178 (59.33) Cooperative 6 (2.00) Not cooperative 47 (15.67) Highly uncooperative 7 (2.33) 
The majority (59.33 %) of the respondents felt that the  attitude of the staff was very cooperative and one-ffth (20.67  %) of them rated that staff are highly cooperative against 15.67  per cent of them rated that the staff are not cooperative and  2.33  per  cent  rated  them  as  highly  uncooperative. This  data  revealed  that  professional  staff  are  employed  by  the  library  to serve the users. After shifting the library, all resources are  made open access so all those problems are solved. 
Respondents rated that the services provided by library  staff are very good (64.67 %) and excellent (17.67 %). Overall  the services provided by the library staff are satisfed by the  respondents because 84.01 per cent of them rated it as good  to excellent. Of the total, the majority (70.33 %) of them state  that they come across some barriers while using the library, but  one-third (29.67 %) of them have not come across any barriers  while using the library.

Respondents suggested that a separate collection should  be  provided  for  each  branch,  project  reports  and  e-journals  should  be  made  easily  accessible  for  reference,  books  and  e-journals, e-magazines should be subscribed for wider usage.  Books, e-readers and computers should be provided to facilitate  the  reading  of  subscribed  e-resources  in  the  library.  Fiction  and  non-fction  books  are  also  suggested  to  add  for  leisure  reading. Air-conditioning, scanning, printing, binding services  should be provided in the library. The competitive exam book  collection and TOEFL books should be procured for preparing  to do Pg  courses abroad and the library internet facility has to  be improved by increasing the network broadband. 
6.8  Overall  Evaluation 
Of  the  total,  the  majority  (78.67  %)  of  them  rated  that  
114 
existing facilities provided by the library are adequate enough  for  their  courses  however,  one-ffth  (21.33  %)  of  them  did  not agree so suggested to take necessary action quickly. From  this  data,  it  is  clear  that  library  is  keeping  up-to-date  with  collections,  improving  facilities  and  services,  therefore,  the  majority of them are satisfed with the library facilities. 
The majority (89 %) of the respondents felt that library  should have a website. It is clear that most of the respondents  wanted  to  have  a  separate  library  website  so  that  lecture  materials, study materials, etc. could be made available on the  college intranet. 
Table  9  shows  that  79.67  per  cent  of  the  respondents  expected that the library should provide a database search on  the library website. Less than half (48.33 %) of them expected  to  provide  subject  gateways  and  29.67  per  cent  expected  to  provide  OPAC  search.  To  implement  this  suggestion,  the  library has to employee an IT technician so that these facilities  and services could be provided.

From  the  above Table  10,  it  is  found  that  three-fourths  (75 %) of the respondents rated as good and very good about  library  collections.  The  majority  (72  %)  of  them  rated  the  library facilities are good and very good. Three-fourth (76 %)  of them rated that library services are good and very good. Of  the total, 47 per cent of the respondents rated the photocopying  services as poor and very poor, so there is an immediate need to  improve and also procure new machine to satisfy users. More  than half (59.33 %) of them rated opening hours of a library as  good and very good. Three fourths (76.67 %) of the respondents  rated that the staff assistance provided in the library as ‘good’  and ‘very good’. From this data, it is clear that most of the  respondents are satisfed with the Library collections, Library  facilities, Library services, opening hours and staff assistance  except photocopying service and fee.  
6.9  Recommendations  of  Library  Users 
To  make  library  services  more  effcient  and  easier  to  use  the  collections,  users  made  a  few  recommendations.  Those include: increase book collection in all core subjects,  digitize all available resources, add more copies of textbooks  wherever  there  is  demand,  increase  library  opening  hours,  add one more counters for circulation, provide a printer and  new photocopying machine, issue 5 reference books to each  student,  provide  a  drop  box  for  returning  books,  the  digital  library should be made available in the main library, training  on searching online databases to be provided, add extra chairs  for  reading  room,  tighten  the  library  security,  increase  the  loan  period  of  textbooks,  subscribe  e-books,  e-journals  and  e-magazines and separate reading room for newspapers.

User  orientation  programme  should  be  conducted  at  regular intervals or from time to time to make the users aware  about library collections; hands-on training may be given on  how  to  use  the  OPAC,  searching  for  information  etc.  to  be  provided20.  User  needs  have  to  be  given  top  priority  during  collection building. The library must organize training for staff  on regular basis to keep them up-to-date. The library should  be user centered than system centered, and also conduct user  studies from time to time to know their day-to-day requirements  and taking feedback on the services provided to them16. 
7.  MAJOR  FINDINGS 
This  study  certainly  will  help  in  building  a  library  collection  that  will  satisfy  engineering  college  students  and  faculty  members.  The  data  analysis  shows  that  about  three  fourths (73.33 %) of the respondents are males outnumbered to  female respondents. In this study the majority (84.01 %) of the  respondents belongs to 20-22 years of age group. Of the total,  over two thirds (68 %) of the respondents are undergraduate  students  and  the  remaining  are  Pg   students  and  faculty  members. Interesting to know that over three fourths 78 (80.33  %) of the respondents prefer to print form textbooks and the  majority (80.33 %) of them also prefer print form reference  books. These  results  matches  to  another  study  conducted  in  USA found that 92 per cent of college students who are heavy  users  of  cellphones  or  tablet  computers  indicated  that  they  prefer print books to e-books for their studies22.  
With  regard  to  the  gaps  in  the  library  collection,  the  majority (80 %) of them indicated that they have not found any  gaps and most (93.33 %) of them have not found any problems  or any other issues in accessing the available resources in the  library. While rating the library services, about three fourths  (72.33 %) of them rated good and very good about circulation  services, and about three fourths (73.67 %) of them rated good  and very good with reference services. However, about three  fourths (73.33 %) of them faced minor issues while borrowing  the  books  because  of  too  many  students  come  together  to  borrow books during their break time in between the classes.  The  only  solution  to  this  problem  is  either  to  employ  more  staff or install auto lending machines; here both the options  are expensive to the institution so one has to look for some  solution for this problem. Overall, the majority (89 %) of them  felt the working hours of the library are suitable to them.  
Of  the  total,  about  three  fourths  (72  %)  of  them  are  in  need of laser printing facility, 71.67 per cent of them wanted  scanning  and  two  thirds  (65.33  %)  of  them  wanted  spiral  binding facility which are to be introduced in the library in the  
near future. Unfortunately, about three fourths (72 %)  Very  
of them are not happy with the photocopying fee in  poor (%) 
the library and that has to be looked into on priority  
0.33 
and soon change the tariff at par with market rates. 
The majority (81.67 %) of the respondents are  
- 
satisfed with the services offered by the library staff.  
0.33 Out of these, 64.67 per cent of them rated the services  17.00 provided by library staff are very good.  
3.33 
More than three fourths (70.33 %) of them stated  
- 
that they have not come across any barriers while using  
the library. The majority (78.67 %) of them rated that  
the existing facilities provided by the library are adequate for  
their courses. Particularly about three fourths (72 %) of them  
are aware about the digital library facility and using it for their  
day-to-day learning, assignments and projects work. At end,  
the majority (89 %) of the respondents felt that library should  
have a separate website which will really help the library to  
upload  their  resources  on  regular  basis  and  users  can  easily  
download the resources of their need. 
8.  CONCLUSIONS 
This study clearly pointed out the vital role of a library  in an engineering college. Most of the students depend on the  print form of library collections. With changes in technology,  library  has  started  providing  an  electronic  form  along  with  print  forms.  User’s  orientation  and  training  should  be  given  in every semester to optimally use the available resources. To  provide superior services, engineering colleges must improve  internet  facilities,  e-journals,  e-magazines,  e-books  etc.  It  should  also  procure  or  subscribe  e-collections,  number  of  computers to be increased and library should be conscious with  information resources to offer effective and precise services to  the users. The engineering college library should always strive  to move along with changes in technology, orient the library  staff to provide new services and assist the users as and when  required.
