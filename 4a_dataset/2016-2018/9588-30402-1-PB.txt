ABSTRACT 
The paper defnes knowledge management (KM) and states its purposes, advantages. It is the original research  work conducted on 50 university librarians in India to fnd out their perception and understanding on KM and its  implementation in universities/university libraries. The major fndings of the study are: KM is more of information-  intensive activity than the information technology- based; large majority (70.0 %) of the university librarians possess  high level of understanding and knowledge on KM, which in fact, is a prerequisite for implementation of KM in the  institutions or libraries; KM enhances the performance of libraries; and non-availability of required library professionals   with IT skills and training is the major constraint in implementation of KM in academic institutions. 
Keywords:  Knowledge management university librarians, knowledge management perception- university librarians,  
knowledge management implementation. 
1. InTRodUCTIon 
“Knowledge  management  (KM)  a  new  field  within  the  discipline  of  social  sciences,  is  receiving  wider  attention by varied kinds of professions, organistions and  individuals, such as business administrators, management  professionals,  IT  and  computer  science  professionals,  library & information science professionals, etc.” Both the  corporate business organisations, and service organisations,  such  as  academic,  healthcare,  and  research  have  been  showing inclination for KM systems implementation for  various reasons like competing with the global markets,  maintaining  their  brand  image,  advancing  research  and  innovations, furthering refinements, and improving their  products  and  services.  
The Encyclopedia of Library & Information Science  defines knowledge management as ‘A management practice  that uses an organisation’s intellectual capital to achieve its  organisation’s mission’. The IFLA knowledge management  section provides the working definition of KM as ‘KM is  a process of creating, storing, sharing, applying and re- using organisational knowledge to enable an organisation  to  achieve  its  goals  and  objectives.’ 
1.1  Importance  and objective  of  KM 
The  KM  is  found  important  for  sustainability  of  organisations  in  the  globalised  competitive  world.  Jawadekar1  states that KM requires efficient management  of Knowledge assets of the organisation. In a knowledge  
the  present  study  are  to:  
(a)  Create  knowledge  repositories 
(b)    Improve  knowledge  access,  or  to  provide  access  to  
knowledge or to facilitate its transfer amongst document  
scanning  and  sharing  tools  and  telecommunications  
networks 
(c)  Enhance  the  knowledge  environment,  so  that  the  
environment is conducive to more effective knowledge  
creation,  transfer  and  use 
(d) Manage knowledge as an asset, and to recognise the  
value  of  knowledge  to  an  organisation 
The  objective  of  the  study  is  to  find  out  the  level  of  understanding  on  knowledge  management  by  the  university  librarians  in  India  and  their  perception  on  implementation  of  KM  in  university  libraries. 
1.2  Hypotheses 
(a)  University  librarians  in  India  possess  adequate  
knowledge  and  understanding  on  KM  and  hence  
they  practice  KM  in  academic  institutions. (b)  University  librarians  in  India  consider  knowledge  
management as an information technology- intensive  
activity and different from information management. (c)  Due to the non-availability of library staff with IT  
skills and training, KM is not practiced in majority  
of  the  university  libraries  in  India.

The  target  population  of  the  study  is  the  head  of  the university libraries (librarians) in India. The sample  studied  is  50  university/higher  education  institutions’  libraries,  which  constitute  almost  one  tenth  of  the  total  population  of  university  libraries  in  India.  
given  by  the  deemed  universities  with  mean  value  of  2.20. Probably, this could be the reason, majority of the  private  and  state  universities  did  not  implement  KM  in  their universities, as they might be either technologically  not conversant or use of technology involves high costs  
of 50 university libraries, using questionnaire technique.  Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software,  Ver.  17  is  used  to  process  the  data. 
For the purpose of conduct of the study, the researcher which  they  cannot  afford.With regard to the consideration of ‘KM as Culture  has collected the primary/empirical data from the librarians &  Management-based  activity’,  Central  universities

The total sample of 50 (fifty) respondents of the study  comprises of 29 (58.0 %) general university librarians, and  21 (42.0  %) technical university librarians, representing

on  the  whole,  the  understanding/perception  of  all  types  of  university  librarians  on  KM  in  the  decreasing  order: KM is information-based ( x =1.48),  followed  by  
all  regions  of  India.  The  technical  universities  include technology based ( 
x =2.10),  and  lastly  it  is  culture  and  
management-based activity ( x =2.30). The  hypothesis-2  
agricultural, law, engineering, etc., universities, including  the  NITs  (National  Institutes  of  Technology.)  Thus,  the  sample represents all kinds of higher education institutions  and  from  all  parts  of  the  country. 
The  university  librarians  were  asked  to  express  their  perception/understanding  and  knowledge  on  KM  by  ranking  from  one  to  five,  using  the  scale  one  being  the highest  rank and five being the lowest rank for the  following statements, viz., KM is information- based, KM  is technology-based, and KM is culture or management -  based activity.  Further, it was hypothesised (Hypothesis 2)  that ‘Knowledge management is an Information Technology  (IT)  intensive  activity  and  different  from  information  
is rejected as it is found from the university librarians’  perception that KM is more of information-intensive activity  than  the  information  technology-based  activity.  
The perspective/understanding of KM by the university  librarians  is  further  explored  in  detail,  on  various  KM  related  concepts  or  statements.  Further,  it  was  also  hypothesised that ‘University librarians in India possess  adequate  knowledge  and  understanding  on  KM’.

As  regards,  KM  as  more  of  technology  -  based  activity,  private  universities  rated  it  as  high  ( x =2.00),  followed  by  state  universities  ( x =2.04)  and  central

From  the  data  in  the  Table  4,  it  can  be  observed   that majority (70.0 %) of the university librarians of all  types possess high level of understanding on KM, which  in fact, is a prerequisite for implementation of KM in the  institutions or libraries. It is, further, observed that only  a  small  section,  i.e.,  little  more  than  one  fourth  of  the  university librarians (28.0 %) possess average or medium  level  of  understanding  or  knowledge  on  KM.  However,  negligible  extent  (2.0  %)  of  the  university  librarians  possess low level of understanding or knowledge on KM.  
universities librarians understanding on KM is 2.63 and  standard  deviation  is  0.62,  the  mean  value  of  deemed  universities librarians understanding on KM is 2.60 and  standard deviation is 0.55 and the mean value of private  universities librarians understanding on KM is 3.00 and  standard  deviation  is  0.00.

              Management  (Mean Values) 
Further, to find out the understanding of KM by the  university librarians, it was hypothesised that “knowledge  management is an information technology (IT) intensive  activity and different from information Management”. The  data obtained in this regard (i.e., the mean scores of the  responses) are presented in table 7, with the measure as  low  mean  value  is  of  high  rank. 
 Table 7 tries to analyse the understanding/perception  of all types of university librarians on KM in the decreasing  order: KM is information-based ( x =1.48),  followed  by  technology-based  ( x =2.10),  and  lastly  it  was  culture  and management-based activity ( x =2.30). The low mean  value  is  of  high  rank.  Hypothesis-2  ‘KM  is  more  of  information  technology-intensive  activity  and  different  from  information  management  is  rejected,  as  observed  from  the  university  librarians’  perception. 
The calculated F value is 0.606 and the tabulated F value  
Hypothesis  4-University  Librarians’  Understanding  
is  2.76  (p=0.614)  with  n1  =  3  and  n2  =  46.      Since  the  calculated  F  value  is  lower  than  the  tabulated  F  value  at  0.05  level  of  significance,  the  deviation  in  the  mean  value  of  the  four  groups  are  not  significant.  Hence,  the

It  also  signifies  that  there  is  no  variance  on  the  understanding  of  KM  by  the  different  types  of  university  librarians  such  as,  state,  central,  private  or  deemed  universities.

the corporate business sector, it is now gaining importance  for implementation in service sectors such as, healthcare,  academic and research institutions. Academic librarians have  been showing inclination for KM systems implementation  in their institutions by virtue of possessing domain skills  of information organisation and management, considering  knowledge  management  as  an  extension  of  information  management. It is observed from the study that the university  librarians  of  all  types  viz.,  central,  state,  deemed,  and  private  possess  adequate  knowledge  and  understanding  on KM, its process, implementation, and advantages. The  university  librarians  perceive  KM  as  more  information  intensive  activity  than  IT-intensive  activity  and  hence,  it can be practiced by them in the academic institutions  or  academic  libraries.  University  librarians  in  India  are  quite  aware  of  KM  and  its  advantages  to  the  academic  institutions  or  libraries  in  furthering  academic,  research  and  training  activities  and  also  in  delivering  effective  information  services  to  their  stakeholders.  All  types  of  university librarians felt the need for qualified and trained  manpower  in  IT,  to  implement  KM  in  libraries.
