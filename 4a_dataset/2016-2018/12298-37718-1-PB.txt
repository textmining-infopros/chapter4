ABSTRACT 
The issues of plagiarism have been mushrooming more rapidly around the globe. India is also not spared from  plagiarism and related issues. Various researchers and academicians have raised their concern on rapidly growing  cases of plagiarism. In this study, an analysis was made to identify the average growth of publications written on  plagiarism by Indian authors, the degree of author collaboration, most impactful sources for publishing on plagiarism.  The data for the period of 2002 – 2016 were extracted from Scopus by executing a query on ‘Plagiarism’ term. In total  385 publications were found and computed. Average citations per publications of 4.01 for the period, 2007-11 was  found high as compared to two other block periods of the study whereas block period 2002-06 was witnessed 49.53  per cent annual growth rate. The Single authored publications prevailed more (34.55 per cent) which interestingly  also achieved 50.38 per cent of the cited rate. It was also observed that the degree of multi-authored collaboration  
has been improving with every passing year.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Plagiarism is one of the most critical aspects of academic  and scientifc research. Historically, the existence of plagiarism  is found since thousands of years. Wager1  gone back to c.AD80  and  reported  that  a  Roman  poet  Martial  claimed  that  his  work was recited by other as his own. Fox2  also reported that  plagiarism related issues were traced back about two thousand  years  ago.  The  cases  of  plagiarism  were  increased  with  the  use  of  printing  technology  and  other  means  of  expressions.  The terms plagiarius or plagiator were used as a kidnapper in  English Criminal law but plagiarius word also used for literary  thief in Roman law for the people who were stealing literary  work of others claiming own’s3. Cunha4  written an excellent  state  of  dubious  defnitions  available  around  with  a  critical  statement, that ‘if you steal from one author, it is plagiarism; if  you steal from many, it is research’. His statement advocates  use of proper citations while quoting or referring others’ works.  With  the  innovations  in  Information  and  communication  technology, the issues of plagiarism were started mushrooming  rapidly across the world. Similarly, various plagiarism cases  have been found in Indian institutes in the recent past. Many  researchers  have  been  conducted  studies  on  plagiarism,  the  forms of plagiarism and how it can be deterred.  
Bibliometric is the only available technique to measure  research output of an author, institute, nation or in a specifc  subject area. In this study, an effort is made here to measure the  Indian research output on ‘plagiarism’ by using bibliometrics.  The analyses are also made to know authorship pattern, most

prolifc  authors,  most  favoured  journals  (source),  and  an  average annual growth rate of publications.  
2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
In the last couple of decades, the world had seen quite  a moderate growth in plagiarism related studies. Many of the  studies have quoted various reasons which encourage plagiarism  in academics and research and how it can be dealt. Qiu5  through  a study published in Nature Journal revealed that Universities  in China offered various benefts including cash prize etc for  publishing in high profle journals which put pressure on the  research community which encouraged academic misconduct.  He  further  quoted  that  in  an  unpublished  survey  report  of  about 6000 researchers of major six universities of China, one- third of the surveyed researchers admitted to plagiarism. He  concluded with to impose a strict legal action on doing such  academic misconducts. Devlin6  revealed that countless cases  of  plagiarism  were  being  detected  among Australian  Higher  Education  every  year.  The  universities  in  Australia  started  focusing  on  implementing  plagiarism  policy  to  deter  such  cases.  Heitman  and  Litewka7   reported  that  students  coming  from Asia, especially from China, India, South Korea, Japan etc  were making about half of the International trainees of United  States. They tried to put forth that trainees from these countries  encourage plagiarism in writings. India, Latin America, Africa  and the Middle East regions are lagging behind showing their  concern about plagiarism than the others regions. Neelakantan8 stated that a few years back, the Indian government was worried  about India’s low research output. The Indian higher education  system revised rules for promotions of teachers, which mainly

DJLIt, VoL.  38,  No.  2,  MArCH   2018 
focused on the number of publications. This decision resulting  in publications by any means that lead to academic misconduct  or  plagiarism  in  many  cases.  She  further  shared  that  editor  of Current Science  had confrmed about 80 plagiarism cases  among publications submitted to the journal during 2006-2008.  Similarly, Aggarwal9, et  al.   stated  that  measuring  academic  achievement is diffcult in the scenario when promotions are  assessed on basis of different job descriptions of individuals. The  Number of research publications is an important component of  career advancement and promotion in India which encouraging  plagiarism in absence of proper policy10-11. 
Garcia-romero  &  Estrada-Lorenzo12   carried  out  an  interesting  study  on  Déjà  vu  database  to  analyse  plagiarism  and self-plagiarism. The Déjà vu database record the entries of  papers published earlier (Original Papers) and later published  papers (plagiarised). the later published papers can be refected  as the duplicate of earlier papers. They found that the authors  who  write  papers  after  the  earlier  ones  were  not  skillful  as  they were unable to publish in reputed journals. Kakol13, et al. highlighted  the  issue  of  self-plagiarism  by  conducting  a  bibliometric analysis. They searched a string of ‘auto OR self  AND plagiarism’ in title, abstracts and keywords felds. they  found 313 records of information sources written in the English  language during the period of 1946-2015. The most productive  country was United States of America (84) followed by United  Kingdom (30) and India (17). They also revealed that merely  19 records were found during 1946 – 2002 and only 27 records  during  2003-2006  whereas  an  exponential  growth  was  seen  in the third block which is 2007-2014 in which 145 records  were found. After 2012 a slight decrease was observed in self- plagiarism related records.  
Velmurugan & Radhakrishnan14  conducted a bibliometric  study on articles indexed by Web of Science for the period of  2010-2014. They executed a query on ‘Plagiarism’ term and  retrieved  795  records.  They  found  that  182  (23  %)  papers  were published in the year 2013. Hong Kong University was  ranked  as  the  most  active  university  by  publishing  11  (1.4  %)  of  the  total  publications  on  plagiarism.  With  respect  to  countries, United States of America had published 200 (25.3  %) of the total publications whereas India achieved 9th  position  by  publishing  16  (2.07  %)  share  of  publications  during  the  period of study. Current Science  is the most preferred journal  for  publishing  plagiarism  related  articles  for  Indian  authors.  Babu15,  et  al.   conducted  a  study  of  medical  undergraduate  students  in  private  medical  schools  of  Pondicherry,  India.  They found that almost all surveyed students were involved  in at least one act of academic dishonesty. Proxy attendance,  technical  help  and  copying  during  exams  are  some  of  the  common  act  of  academic  dishonesty.  They  concluded  with  the suggestion of establishing centers for academic integrity  in India. There were also other studies of medical institutions  of  India  which  highlighted  academic  misconduct  a  critical  problem which needs to be deterred soon16-20. Johnson21, et al. raised various questions on the use of bibliometrics techniques  especially when online journals are the key access points for  producer and user of information. They believed that the data  available  online  can  easily  be  tampered  or  aggravated  with  various  means.  However,  it  is  also  evident  through  various  
70 
studies that bibliometrics is the only technique available which  helps in measuring research output with respect to publications  produced and citation received. 
Boisvert  &  Irwin22   highlighted  that  after  observing  a  steep rise in plagiarism cases among the articles submitted for  publication in Association of Computing Machinery (ACM),  the  publication  board  introduced  the  plagiarism  policy  for  the authors. Martin23  stated that universities in Australia were  enforcing to use plagiarism detection service and recommending  the use of Turnitin for checking student’s essays. The author  indicated  that  the  plagiarism  detection  tools  can  only  check  for word-for-word writings from the documents stored in its  repository. These cannot check for the ideas taken from others,  writings copied from the source which is not in the database  and written in other (other than English) languages. But these  detection tools may help in detecting students who intend to  cheat by using readily available text. Once students got to know  the presence of such tool for checking their written pieces, they  may deter from plagiarism.  
Sutherland-Smith24  explored the legal and academic aspect  of plagiarism. He stated that teachers need to put in collective  efforts for developing quality academic writing programmes  whereas plagiarism related issues are mostly being discussed  individually,  what  should  or  should  not  be  included  in  the  plagiarism  also  need  to  clarify  universally.  Bird25   argued  in  favour of ‘self-plagairism’ when one author uses his/her own  ideas in different works. Since the word plagiarism defned as  an  act  of  presenting  ideas  or  words  of  others  as  one’s  own.  However,  he  stated  that  ‘self-plagiarism’  become  a  serious  issue  when  one  author  publish  his/her  own  same  work  repeatedly  which  generally  called  ‘self  plagiarism’  of  dual  publications. Anderson and Steneck26  stated that plagiarism is  a grave matter and researchers should take proper precautions  to acknowledge all works they referred. They also highlighted  that in US Federal Government defned plagiarism as a type  of misconduct along with fabrication and falsifcation and this  defnition is applicable to all research institutions. Yadav11, et  al.  suggested having strict laws to control the plagiarism and  advised to various councils involved in the higher education  system  to  play  an  important  role  in  deterring  plagiarism.  India  should  have  a  regulatory  body  like  the  Committee  on  Publication Ethics, UK and ORI, USA so that stricter action  can be taken against who plagiarized.  
3. METHODOLOGY 
The  study  aims  to  evaluate  the  research  publications  in  the  area  of  plagiarism  appeared  in  international  citation  database. the  study  confned  to  the  publications  published  under Indian affliation. It refected that study evaluated only  those publications which have at least one author from India.  The data were extracted from Scopus database which is one  of the largest abstract and citation databases of peer-reviewed  literature.  The  data  were  extracted  by  executing  following  query:  
(ALL(plagiarism) AND ( LIMIt-to  ( AFFILC oUNtrY,  “India” ))) 
The data for 15 years, i.e. from 2002 to 2016, were taken  into  consideration  and  evaluation.  It  was  also  observed  that  

========2========

CHAUHAN : INDIA  o N  P LAGIArISM: A BIBLIoMEtrIC  A NALYSIS 
in  the  year  2002  no  publication  was  found  in  the  extracted  data. In total 385 entries were extracted which were computed  and analysed by using bibliometric techniques. The analysis  was  done  on  keeping  three  block  periods  (2002-06,  2007- 11  and  2012-16)  covering  fve  years  in  each  block  for  easy  representation of data.  
4. DATA ANALYSIS 
A total 385 records of Indian authors on ‘Plagiarism’ were  indexed  by  Scopus.  Throughout  the  study,  all  these  records  were referred as publications. The document type distribution  of publications accommodated 36.10 per cent (139) conference  papers,  25.45  per  cent  (98)  research  articles,  14.03  per  cent  (54) letters and remaining 24.42 per cent (94) were reviews,  book chapters, and short survey etc. The year-wise detail of  total  publications  (TP)  and  total  citations  (TC)  are  given  in  the  Table  1,  which  further  analysed  in  three  block  periods  enveloping fve years in each block.

4.1 Citations  per  Publication  and  Cited  Rate 
As  highlighted  in  Table  2,  all  publications  (385)  have  received  700  citations  with  an  average  of  1.82  citations  per  publication.  During  the  block  period  of  2002-06,  the ACPP  was 2.21 which got improved to 4.01 in the next block (2007- 11).  The  last  block  period,  i.e.  2012-16  has  attained  1.16  ACPP which is expected to improve in next couple of years as  publications start attracting citations after one or two years.

ACPP 2.21 4.01 1.16 1.82

The citation analysis helps us in identifying the number  of articles being cited from the total number of articles written  by an Institute, country or in a subject area during one year  or any stipulated duration. The Table 1 also indicates that the  total cited rate (CR) of publications written by Indian authors  during 2002-2016 was 45.19 per cent. That means overall about  55 per cent of the publications on plagiarism were not being  cited. Whereas, it is also observed that the last block period  (2012-16) has only less than 50 per cent cited rate among three  block  periods.  That  is  because  the  new  publications  started  attracting  citations  after  one  or  two  years.  Therefore,  the  publications published in 2015 and 2016 may yet to get cited.  
4.2 Annual  Growth  Rate 
On basis of plagiarism related publications, productivity  of Indian authors, an average annual growth rate (GR) were also  assessed. The GR was calculated by the following formula:  
Annual growth rate (GR)=Present publications  
 
Past publications  
^ 
 
1 
Number of years 
-1 
(e.g.,  in  the  year  2007  Indian  authors  published  6  publications  on  plagiarism  and  32  in  2011.  On  basis  of  above formula, the 6 is the ‘Past Publications’, 32 is ‘Present  Publications’ and 5 is ‘Number of Years’.) 
As stated in Table 1, Indian authors had published 385  scholarly publications during the period from 2002 to 2016.  the Indian authors have published 14 articles, during frst block  covering period from 2002 to 2006, with the annual growth  rate of 49.53 per cent. In the second block period (2007-11) the  annual growth rate was dipped to 39.77 per cent and in third  block period, i.e. 2012-16 the annual growth rate further gone  down to 19.34 per cent as shown in Fig. 1.  
The  overall  annual  growth  rate  of  38.12  per  cent  was  computed while calculating it for 2002 to 2016 period. The low  annual growth during 2012-16 is depicting stagnated research  efforts in the area of plagiarism in India. Although, University  Grants Commission has come up with a draft plagiarism policy  for  academic  higher  institutions  in  the  September  month  of  2017. It is expected to be implemented soon and a different set  of research may expect to take place afterward.

4.3  Authorship  Pattern 
The authorship pattern of plagiarism related publication  written by Indian authors was also analysed. As highlighted  in  Fig.  2,  the  133  publications  (34.55  %)  were  written  in  single  authorship.  These  single-authored  publications  were  achieved 50.38 cited rate, that means about 50 per cent of the  publications  written  in  Single  authorship  were  cited  by  one  or more publications, whereas multi-authored publications (2  or more than two authors) got 42.46 cited rate. It shows the  dominance of single authorship pattern of plagiarism related  publications.  The  publications  of  two  authors  were  shared  31.95 per cent (123) of total publications which attained 40.65  cited rate. The publications written by three authors were 61  which  contributed  15.84  per  cent  of  the  total  publications  with the  cited rate of  44.26  per  cent similarly,  four  authors’  publications  were  10.39  per  cent  (40)  with  the  cited  rate  of  45.00, fve authors publications contributed to 3.90 per cent  (15)  share  with  46.67  cited  rate  and  six  and  more  than  six  authors  put  in  3.38  per  cent  (13)  share  of  total  publications  which got 38.46 cited rate.

It was found that degree of collaboration of authors was  merely  0.21  (i.e.,  21  %)  during  frst  block  period  (2002-06)  of the study. In the second block period (2007-11) the degree  of author collaboration was  improved to 0.50 (50 %)  and it  improved  further  by  0.72  (72  %)  in  the  third  block  period.  The overall degree of author collaboration was also calculated  to  0.65  with  the  mean  value  of  0.48.  The  degree  of  author  collaboration during 2002-06 was low which was improved in  both the next block periods.  
Table 2. 
Authorship Pattern of publications during the period 2002-2016. 
The  analysis  disclosed  that  single  authorship  pattern  is  more  prevalent  than  two,  three  or  more  numbers  of  authors  in plagiarism related publications which also has a good cited  rate  (50.38).  From  the  analysis,  it  may  also  be  derived  that  researchers  working  in  different  subject  areas  like  to  work  independently  to  share  their  opinion  on  different  issues  of  plagiarism.  
4.4  The  Degree  of Author  Collaboration 
The degree of authorship collaboration was also determined  by applying a mathematical formula given by Subramanyam27.  The following formula was considered to express the degree of  author collaboration in this study.  
Degree of author collaboration (C) = 
Nm 
Nm Ns+ 
In  this  mathematical  formula,  C  refects  the  degree  of  author  collaboration,  Nm   is  the  number  of  publications  under  multiple-authorship  and Ns represents  the  number  of  publications in single-authorship. On basis of this expression,  the block-wise degree of author collaboration was presented  in Table 3. 
72 
4.5  Prolific Authors 
As highlighted in Table 4, the analysis was  also made to fnd out the leading Indian authors  with more number of publications on plagiarism.  Dr Deepa Gupta of Amrita University, Bangalore  found to be the most prolifc author with respect to  the number of publications (11) followed by Dr K.  Vani of the same university with 9 publications. Dr  P. Chaddah of UGC-DAE Consortium of Scientifc  Research has contributed 7 publications whereas  N. Mukunda, Editor Indian Academy of Sciences  has  contributed  5  ‘Notes’  on  Plagiarism.  The  similar  numbers  of  publications  were  written  by  Dr S.V. Shinde and Dr V. Singh. The publications  of  Dr  V.  Singh  have  achieved  17  citations  with  3.40 Average Citation per Publications.  
4.5  Source Title  Impact  Ratio 
The 385 publications were appeared (published) in 112  sources (Source Titles). An exercise was made to identify the  high impact sources in which Indian authors liked to publish  on  plagiarism. the  top  10  sources  were  identifed  in  which  Indian authors had written more numbers of publications. The  cited rate (CR) and average citation per publication (ACPP)  were also calculated so that impact of source document can  be determined through the citations received by publications  published in that source. The following metrics is used to know  the source title impact ratio (STIR). 
Source Title Impact Ratio (STIR)  = 
TP CR ACPP++ 
100 where  TP  is  total  publications  (To  offer  weight-age  on  accommodating number of publications), CR is cited rate (to  accommodate  quality  impact  of  the  source  with  respect  to  publication cited) and ACPP is average citation per publication  (to add quality of publications through received citations) 
the table 5 highlights StIr  of 10 most prolifc sources  accommodated  plagiarism  related  publications.  Though,  the

Current Science  published the highest number of publications  (25) on plagiarism but managed the Second rank with 0.78 STIR  points. Another Indian origin journal, Lung India  achieved top  spot by publishing 8 publications only. However, the Cr  and  ACPP of publications published in this journal were high as  compared  to  other  sources  and  on  basis  of  above  formula,  Lung India  got 0.99 STIR points. The Economic and Political  Weekly published from India placed at Fourth rank with 0.50  STIR  points.  Another  Indian  journal  International  Journal  of Applied Engineering Research placed at Tenth STIR rank  with  0.20  points.  Remaining  source  titles  were  international  publications  published  by  other  countries. Apart  from  India,  the four source titles of Germany have been also included in  the  top  ten  most  favoured  sources  for  publishing  plagiarism  related publications. All Indian titles are available under open  access mode which also includes partial open access to articles  published in Economic and Political Weekly.  
5. CONCLUSIONS  
The  study  assessed  the  publications  written  by  Indian  authors on plagiarism during the period of 2002 to 2016. In the  initial period of the study, the single authorship pattern was more  prevalent which has been changing rapidly in every passing  year  as  the  degree  of  authors  collaboration  (multi-authored  publications)  has  increased  in  last  few  years.  The  single- authored publications have also attained the highest cited rate  which also indicated that single-authored publications attracted  
more citations than others. It is also observed that Indian authors  have been writing more frequently in sources from India and  which are accessible freely. It indicates that most of the Indian  authors  are  avoiding  publishing  their  research  output  in  the  international journals. Since good International journals accept  high-quality research papers and also take a good amount of  time to publish them. Indian authors need to do some serious  research  on  plagiarism.  However,  many  academicians,  researchers  and  policy-makers  have  suggested  establishing  an active and strict regulatory or policy on plagiarism at the  national level. Consequently, University Grants Commission  (India) has come up with a draft of the national level policy  for deterring plagiarism. This drafted policy includes different  types  of  penalties  if  anyone  found  guilty.  The  draft  policy  also suggested to setting up Plagiarism Disciplinary Authority  (PDA)  and  Academic  Misconduct  Panel  (AMP)  in  Indian  universities and colleges. It has been expected that a different  kind of research would take place on the introduction of this  plagiarism policy in India.
