The article highlights the total expenditure on various databases in general and subject-wise by University of  Delhi and discusses an annual average increase in foreign databases and impact of exchange rates on expenditure.  It highlights the cumulative annual growth rate in general and subject-wise also. The various reasons presented by  the publishers for increase in subscription are also discussed. The paper also presents solutions to meet the challenge  
of ever increasing cost of databases. 
Keywords: Electronic databases, cost of knowledge, database subscription 
1.  IntRoduCtIon 
Libraries are spending bulk of its financial allocations  to  have  access  to  the  information  needed  by  its  users.  Academic librarians in the last year about the allocation  of  their  collections  budgets,  most  mention  that  70  %  to  90  %  is  devoted  to  electronic  resources  with  the  remainder  to  print  materials1.  However,  the  question  remains that whether the libraries will be able to sustain  the  subscription  of  various  databases  being  subscribed  by  keeping  in  view  the  price  cap  and  the  impact  of  currency  exchange  rates.  A  case  study  of  university  of  delhi has taken to discuss the impact of price cap along  with  exchange  rates  on  sustainability  of  e-resources.  Based on the empirical data a projection is made for the  next  ten  years  regarding  expected  growth  in  the  prices  of  e-resources  and  need  of  the  financial  allocations  for  retaining  the  subscription  of  databases. 
The University of Delhi with modest beginning with  just three colleges, two faculties (Arts and Science) and  about  750  students  has  now  become  one  of  the  India’s  largest institutions of higher learning, and among the largest  in the world. Presently the university has 85 constituent  and affiliated colleges, 16 faculties, 82 departments and  14  centres.  The  total  number  of  students  enrolled  in  the  university  during  the  academic  year  2014-15  was  6,28,443. Of these 2,03,460 students were enrolled in the  colleges, 17,098 in the university departments, 3,91,344  in  the  school  of  open  learning  and  16,541  in  the  Non- collegiate  women’s  education  board2. 
2.  MEthodoLogy 
Subscription costs of all the databases being subscribed  by  university  of  delhi  in  original  cost  were  collected.  
The original cost, in case of foreign databases, converted  into at exchange rates of reserve bank of India as on 1st  January of the concerned year. Since bulk of the budget  of electronic databases is being spent on foreign databases  the  cost  only  of  foreign  database  has  been  analysed  on  the  basis  of  various  indicators  like  average  increase,  cumulative  average  increase,  subject  wise  expenditure  and  growth  in  subscription  rates,  tables  and  graphs  are  prepared.  On  the  basis  of  analysis,  a  projected  growth  for  next  10  years  has  been  made  references  are  given  as  per  IEEE. 
3. ExpEndItuRE   on  E-R ESouRCES 
Being ranked number one among the universities it has  been spending substantial amount on electronic resources  since  2006  besides  getting  access  through  INFLIBNET.  In  fact  University  of  Delhi  is  the  highest  subscriber  of  databases  among  the  universities  in  India.  It  has  access  to  science  direct,  sage  online,  wiley  online,  lexis-nexis,  scopus,  springer  online,  scifinder,  IEL  onlinemention  few.  University  of  delhi  has  also  been  ranked  one  for  usage  of  INFLIBNET  databases.  University  of  Delhi  also purchased number of archives, e.g., Science Direct,  Sage  Online,  Emerald  Management  Extra,  etc.,  in  the  year  2010.  
Table 1 provides a glimpse of spending on e-resources  and number of electronic databases being subscribed by  university of delhi since 2006. Table 1 and Fig. 1 reveal  that the university has started subscription of electronic  databases for it users in 2006 with 14 foreign databases  spending approx 1.23 crore which has enhanced to 4.02  crore  in  the  current  year  i.e.,  2016  Delhi  University  renewed  the  subscription  of  47  databases  (39  foreign  and  8  Indian)  and  adding  two  new  foreign  database.

Regarding  comparative  CAgR  of  three  currencies,  the  $  has  been  increasing  @  3.99  %,  €  by  3.56  %  and  £  by  1.56  %  per  annum.  Due  to  the  fluctuation  in  exchange  rates  an  overall  increase  in  the  last  ten  year  subscription  of  foreign  database  has  been  45.01  %  in  terms  of  original  currency  which  rose  to  112.6  %  when  into.  The  decreasing  trends  is  emerging  from  the  Table  for  the  last  three  years  as  the  average  increase  was  2.84  %,  3.22  and  -0.5  for  2014,  2015  and  2016, respectively. This trends matches with the EBSCO  projections  for  the  same  period.3,4,5 Another  reason  for  decreasing  trends  during  the  last  three  years  could  be  intensive  negotiation  by  the  university  of  delhi.

Table 3 provides an analysis of percentage of budget  for e-resources is being spend on various subjects. Further  analysis  of  subscription  prices  of  foreign  databases  (in  their  original  currency)  by  subjects  reveals  that  there  has  always  been  positive  increase  every  year  in  case  of  databases  belonging  to  science,  management,  and  social  science  whereas  in  other  subjects  there  has  been  a negative growth also in some years. Databases belong  to  sciences  have  shown  highest  increase  (83.75  %)  in  subscription  prices  followed  by  economics  (67.22  %),  management  (47.09  %),  computer  science  (43.27  %),  generalia  (36.84  %),  social  sciences  (29.41  %),  law  (23  %)  and  arts  and  humanities  (8.84  %).  Subscription  prices  of  statistical  sources  have  shown  negative  trends  as  their  prices  are  reduced  by  1.05  %. 
On  analyis  of  the  impact  of  exchange  rates,  it  is  revealed  that  despite  the  negative  growth  (-1.05  %)  in  statistical  databases  in  their  original  currency  there  has  been  a  positive  growth  (25.26  %)  when  converted  the  into  original  currency.  Subscription  prices  of  science  databases have enhanced by 179.54 % though the growth in  original currency was 83.75 % and in arts and humanities

The cumulative annual growth rate (CAgR) in various  subjects  and  overall  of  the  entire  databases  since  2006  being  subscribed  by  University  of  Delhi  is  shown  in  Table  4.  and  Fig.  4.  These  show  the  CAgR  of  various  databases  according  to  their  subjects.  Table  4  reveals  that  in  totality  the  CAgR  is  9.60  %  per  annum.  
The CAgR in case of databases originated from other  countries  is  3.80  %  before  currency  impact.  However,

when  the  original  currency  is  converted  into  Indian  currency  the  CAgR  climbs  to  9.25  %  per  annum  for  foreign databases. The databases originated from India are  also in fact having higher CAgR i.e., 11.51 % compared  to  foreign  databases  (9.25  %)  in  terms  of  as  regards  to  the  CAgR,  in  relation  to  various  subjects  (foreign  databases only) it has been revealed that the subscription  rate of science databases has the highest CAgR account  for  12.64  %  followed  by  economics  (10.28  %),  social  sciences  (9.37  %),  generalia  (8.43  %),  management  (7.89 %), computer science (7.63 %), law (7.59 %), and  lowest  is  arts  and  humanities  which  is  7.10  %.

Offer Price:  Publishers/aggregators/vendors of electronic  databases  offer  heavy  discounted  subscription  prices  of  their databases in the beginning to promote their product(s)  and  enhance  the  price  after  getting  popularity.  Change  in  Tier:   In  some  cases  if  the  usage  go  up  and  cross the certain level they increase the price and place  the  institution  on  a  higher  tier,  hence,  require  to  pay  more  to  access  the  database.  
Acquisition and Mergers of Publisher: whenever there is  change in the ownership of publishing house the pricing  of  e-databases  get  changed.

As per CAgR in various subjects and in totality the  multidisciplinary  academic  institutions  libraries  have  to  double  its  financial  allocation  in  next  8  years  to  retain  the  subscription  of  the  existing  databases.  Future  is  tenser  for  the  libraries,  like,  CSIR,  IITs,  NIITs,  Indian  Institute of Science, etc., extensively subscribing science  databases as they have to double their existing finance in  the  next  six  years.  Doubling  period  of  existing  finance  is  10  years  for  subjects,  like,  arts  and  humanities,  computer  science,  law.  In  case  of  economics  and  social  sciences  the  existing  finance  has  to  be  doubled  within  7 years.Management libraries should convert it financial  allocations  for  retaining  existing  management  databases  within  the  period  of  9  years.

Librarians  are  walking  on  the  double-side  edge  weapon. One side they have to find the solution for rising  cost of e-databases, especially, foreign databases and on  other  side  ever  increasing  exchange  rates. They  have  to  strike a right balance between ever increasing information  needs  of  the  users  and  availability  of  resources  in  the  library  to  satisfy  those  information  needs. 
Fortunately, the developments in information technology  create new opportunities for librarians. The following are  some  suggestive  solutions  to  meet  these  challenges.  
10.1 national  Consortia 
Since  information  should  be  considered  as  national  resource,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  set  up  a  national  consortium  by  the  government  of  India  who  would  be  responsible to provide any information/documents needed  by any person/institution/libraries, etc., in India. National  library consortia will have an advantage to have expert’s  knowledge  not  only  for  selecting  the  resources  but  also  to  negotiate  the  prices  of  e-resources. 
10.2  Library  Cooperation 
During the print era, the libraries used to subscribe  only core titles of periodicals which were useful to meet  the  objective  of  the  institution.  For  auxiliary  titles  they  used  to  depend  on  the  other  libraries.  They  received  documents  not  available  in  their  collection  on  ILL.  
Instead  of  subscribing  bundle  collection  and  try  to  be  self-sufficient,  the  libraries  should  scribe  only  core  titles and for auxiliary titles they should get cooperation  from  other  libraries.  
10.3 Access versus ownership 
Introduction  of  new  pricing  models  by  publishers  such  as  licensing  (rather  than  subscription)  and  access  fees  for  e-information  sources  and  relatively  favourable  offers for consortia agreements has made the economics  of  cooperation  more  visible.

10.4 pay per view transactions 
Users  tend  to  download  a  single  article  number  of  times without realising the cost of download. Sometime  they  download  articles  after  seeing  the  catchy  titles  of  the  articles  though  not  related  to  their  area  of  study.  The libraries don’t keep the record who is downloading  what,  why’,  and  how  many  times  and  even  for  whom  (for  himself  or  for  someone  else).  Even  usages  of  many e-resources that are fully subscribed indicate low.  Moreover,  experts  are  raising  questions  on  the  usage  statistics  provided  by  the  publishers.  To  tackle  this  problem  the  libraries  may  adopt  the  policy  to  pay  for  per view transaction. This will help libraries not only to  lower the cost but also to maintain the records regarding  who  is  using  what  and  why. 
10.5  Multiyear price  Cap Agreement 
Another  solution  to  the  problem  is  to  enter  with  publishers/aggregators/vendors multi-year agreements in  which  price  cap  is  fixed  if  the  library  agrees  to  renew  the  subscription  of  the  database  for  years.  They  agreed  to keep the capped pricing as low as 3-5 % for libraries  who  agree  to  purchase  the  database  for  multiple  years. 
10.6  Return  on  Investment  Study 
It is a high time for libraries in India to do research  on  return  on  investment  (ROI)  which  would  help  in  identifying the impact of the usage of electronic journals  on  the  activity  of  publishing  articles  by  university- affiliated researchers. In particular, it analyses the impact  of  the  usage  of  e-journals  on  the  scientific  production  (publications, citations) by domain and type of institution.  It develops indicators of causal relationships between usage,  publications and citations, and analyses the evolution of  the  phenomena  of  causality  in  time6. 
10.7 discontinuation  of print journal 
In  India,  some  of  the  libraries  are  still  maintaining  the print run despite the availability of the same title in  e-format.  The  libraries  need  to  reformulate  this  policy

and discontinue the print run of the journal hence, save  the  expenditure  of  the  library. 
10.8 just  in time Access  
Information should be considered as national resource  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  set  up  a  national  consortium.  Instead  of  subscribing  bundle  collection  and  try  to  be  self-sufficient  the  libraries  should  subscribe  only  core  
Libraries have been subscribing number of databases  titles and for auxiliary titles, they should get cooperation  in anticipation of demand, i.e., ‘Just-in-Case’ users need  from  other  libraries. The  libraries  may  adopt  the  policy  any  article  the  library  doesn’t  to  contact  the  publisher.  to pay-for-per view transaction to reduce the expenditure.  In  this,  there  are  chances  that  there  may  not  be  enough  Another solution to the problem is to enter with publishers/ demand  for  the  database  justifying  its  subscription.  In  aggregators/vendors multi-year agreements in which price  ‘Just  in  Time’,  the  libraries  acquire  the  document  after  cap is fixed if the library agreed to renew the subscription  receiving the demand from the user. ‘Just in time’ access  of the database for years. The libraries need to discontinue  satisfies  information  needs  of  scholars  and  keeps  cost  the print run of the journals whose e-access is available.

10.9  open Access  Resources 
Libraries  must  be  upto  date  with  the  ever  evolving  information landscape and always on the hunt for reduced  costs for accessing scholarly quality information. So far  these  free  resources  have  been  used  to  supplement  and  add  value  to  the  library’s  collection.  The  evaluation  of  the free internet resources that have been ‘added’ to the  library’s collection is ongoing, hopefully to allow for the  cancellation  of  equivalent  for-fee  resources.  
11.  ConCLuSIonS 
Expenditure  on  subscription  of  e-resources  has  been  increasing  at  the  rate  of  9.60  %  per  annum  since  2006.  The  University  of  Delhi  spends  most  on  science  databases  (58-80  %)  and  least  on  arts  and  humanities.  Overall increase in the last 10 year subscription of foreign  databases has been 45.01 % in terms of original currency  which  rises  to  112.6  %  in  terms  of  the  $  (increasing  @  3.99  %),  €  by  3.56  %  and  £  by  1.56  %  per  annum  since 2006. Therefore libraries should add an additional  5-7 % to the estimated price increases while preparing a  budget. Databases belong to sciences have shown highest  increase  (83.75  %)  in  subscription  prices  followed  by  economics (67.22 %), management (47.09 %), computer  science  (43.27  %),  generalia  (36.84  %),  social  sciences  (29.41 %), law (23 %) and arts and humanities (8.84 %).  Subscription  prices  of  statistical  sources  have  shown  negative  trends  as  their  prices  are  reduced  by  1.05  %. 
The  CAgR  for  databases  originated  from  other  countries  is  3.80  %  before  currency  impact  but  rose  to  9.25  %  per  annum  after  converting.  Regarding  various  subjects (foreign databases only), science databases have  the  highest  CAgR  (12.64  %)  followed  by  economics  (10.28  %),  social  sciences  (9.37  %),  generalia  (8.43),  management  (7.89  %),  computer  science  (7.63  %),  law  (7.59  %),  and  lowest  is  arts  and  humanities  (7.10  %).  Therefore,  it  is  suggested  that  the  libraries  should  add  an  additional  5-7  %  to  the  estimated  price  increases  while  preparing  a  budget. 
Use  ‘Just’-in-time’  policy  instead  of  ‘Just-in-Case’  to  arrest  the  increasing  trend  of  expenditure  on  electronic  resources.  Libraries  must  keep  up  to  date  with  the  ever  evolving  information  landscape  always  on  the  hunt  for  reduced costs for accessing scholarly quality information.  So far these free resources have been used to supplement  and  add  value  to  the  library’s  collection.
