With the advent of open access movement, open access journals (OAJs) being the prodigious source of academic  and research information have been gaining signifcant magnitude. The electronic age has made it easier and more  convenient than ever to break barriers to research information. The present study aims to study and analyse the status  of 497 OAJs in Agriculture indexed in Directory of Open Access Journals. Specifed traits such as Geographic and  language wise distribution, coverage of Indexing/Abstracting databases, ranking of journals according to Impact  Factor (IF), OA licensing model adopted, policy of plagiarism, visibility on social media and related issues of the  OAJs in Agriculture are evaluated in the paper. Results indicated the dominance of De Gruyter Open as a publisher  with highest number of OAJs, English as a content language, Indonesia with highest number of OAJs, Google scholar  with highest journals indexed. The study observes the increasing migration of journals from commercial practice to  OA. Frontiers in Plant Science  found with highest Impact Factor among OAJs in Agriculture.

1.  IntrODuCtIOn 
The  open  access  revolution  has  brought  about  the  tremendous changes in the knowledge business. Open Access  Journals (OAJs) are gaining more prominence as they are being  the most central platform for research information distribution.  The utility of research information has reached its highest point  and this is resulting in commercial publications turning into  open access (OA). Open access brings more visibility, utility  and  can  be  huge  source  for  progressing  the  further  research  in every branch of human knowledge. The digital lock which  opens  only  to  the  high  price  subscription  has  been  a  huge  obstacle  for  libraries  with  limited  fnancial  aid.  The  open  access  (OA)  practice  is  contributing  to  maximise  the  access  to scholarly information in a well orderly manner with related  licenses such as creative commons. Libraries of modern age  are  fnding  ways  to  provide  even  newly  published  research  literature through Gold Open Access and Green Open Access  where  authors  take  initiative  to  make  their  work  available  in  a  private  or  institutional  repository1.  The  ever  advancing  technologies  that  offer  electronic  delivery  of  journals,  the  process of compiling, distribution and access of information  are becoming increasingly less expensive2.

which  traces  back  to  the  early  days  of  human  civilisation.  Agriculture in the modern world has gained noble worthiness  as food is the foundation of life for every living being. It has  been a source of national income for most of the developing  economies.  Agriculture  plays  key  role  in  determining  the  economic  development  of  a  nation.  Research  in Agriculture  has been vigorous than ever as it even deals with many non- agriculture  areas  such  as  supply  of  raw  materials  and  wage  goods to industries which completely depend on Agriculture.  Naturally,  the  research  information  in  this  area  is  growing  signifcantly.  OAJs  have  been  facilitating  the  access  to  scholarly and research information in Agriculture with no cost.  As  per  the  DOAJ  index,  there  are  497  OAJs  in  the  feld  of  Agriculture.

With the enormous amount of information explosion, it has  been a great challenge to balance the equilibrium in providing  access to information. Journals become most important part of  the knowledge of present and past as they constantly deal with  research results. Access to such journals is essential to further  the research and development activities. OA concept came into  existence  with  the  realisation  of  need  to  equalise  the  access  to  scientifc  information.  Along  the  time,  increase  in  OAJs  became noticeable.  The rapid growth in the number of OAJs  is  putting  on  challenges  of  quality  management,  evaluation,  fndability etc.3. Visibility becomes major issue in the world  of research especially with OA publications. The unfortunate

exclusion  of  grey  literature,  valuable  contents  in  various  languages, historical literature from standard abstracting and  indexing  databases  fails  the  OAJs  to  reach  wide  range  of  users4. Pujar5  opines that many scholarly journals are showing  increasing acceptance of OA model ever since OAJ concept  came into existence. Contribution and utility of OAJs have been  enhanced due to the OA movement which created a promising  environment  with  the  participation  of  developing  countries6.  A  study  conducted  across  various  inter  disciplinary  subjects  such as Philosophy, Political Science, Electrical and Electronic  Engineering  and  Mathematics  confrmed  OAJs  can  achieve  better Impact Factor than that of Non-OAJs and this may be  due  to  the  universal  availability7.  The  results  the  study  was  promising and encouraging for wider adoption of OA practice.  The OA movement is urging the publishing industry to adopt  OA licenses which in other words called copyleft licenses and  adoption of one or the other creative commons model for OA  content distribution has become a trend8.

4.  ObJeCtIveS 
The  present  study  aims  to  study  the  status  and  analyse  OAJs in Agriculture as listed in DOAJ. The prime objectives of  the study are to measure and analyse geographic and language  wise  distribution  and  determine  prolifc  publishers.  The  objectives also include ranking the OAJs as per Impact Factor  (If), fnding coverage of indexing and abstracting databases  where the OAJs in Agriculture are indexed, studying extent of  gap in the access, OA licensing models adopted, and policies on  Article Processing Charges (APC)/Article Submission Charges  (ASC) and waivers. Analysis of formats and platforms adopted  for  content  distribution,  plagiarism  policy  and  adoption  of  social media come at the extended part of the study. 
5.  MethODOlOgy 
DOAJ was considered for the study as a source OAJs in  Agriculture. Metadata database of the entire set of OAJs was  downloaded from DOAJ website. under the subject column  of downloaded database, journals with the term “Agriculture”  were harvested. In total, 497 journal were found matching the  term.  Information  in  the  metadata  downloaded  from  DOAJ  served  the  partial  information  requirement.  using  weblinks  given in the database as well as Google search engine, each  of the journals’ websites was visited and scrutinised to record  information  on  predefned  criteria.  Journal  citation  Report  (JCR) 2016 was referred  for obtaining the Impact Factor of  the listed journals. 
Out of total 497 journal, websites of 5 journal were found  being inoperable and 4 being ceased publication but providing  access to archive. Omitting 9 journal, a total of 488 journal  were considered for the study.  Data for distinguished criteria  of the study were gathered visiting the websites of journals and  metadata downloaded from DOAJ.

OAJs in Agriculture also deal with interdisciplinary subjects  such  as  Environmental  Sciences,  biology,  botany,  Animal  culture,  food  Science,  Geography,  Anthropology,  Ecology,  Veterinary  Medicine,  Fisheries,  Aquaculture,  Forestry  and  many more. Such multidisciplinary journals are also considered  for the study as Agriculture is one of the subjects they deal  with.

Scientifc journals have the practice of publishing articles  in  multiple  languages  in  the  same  issue  which  broadens  the  horizon of research. The study records content of 488 OAJs in  Agriculture being published in as many as 28 language. The  study of language aspect was carried out through two segments  such  as  journals  with  single  language  and  journals  with  multiple  languages  (Table  2).  The  proportion  of  journals  in  single and multiple languages is 63.31 % and 36.68 % orderly.  In the segment of journals with single language, English (238;  77.02 %) is leading. Languages such as Indonesian (10.36 %),  Persian (3.88 %) and have been consecutively used the most.  There are 7 language having single publication each (0.32 %).

Even in this division English (38.24 %) has been at the  top. followed by Spanish; Castilian (16.86 %) and Portuguese  (15.20 %). It is well evident that English has been accepted  as  universal  language  for  publishing  OAJs  in  Agriculture.  The previous studies on OAJs in different disciplines as well  depicted the dominance of English5,6. 
9.  PrOlIfIC  Publ ISherS 
OAJs  in  Agriculture  are  published  by  wide  range  of  publishers  across  the  globe.  Among  the  publishers’  universities, research organisations, academic institutions and  regular publishers form the major part. De Gruyter Open with  32  publication  (6.56  %)  is  leading  with  highest  number  of  journals (Table 3). czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences  and Elsevier (2.25 %) have been at the consecutive position  with  11  publication  each  followed  by biomed central  (10;  2.05  %). There  are  four  publishers  with  6  publication  (1.23  %),  2  publisher  with  4  journal  (0.82  %)  and  3  publisher  with 3 journal (0.61 %) each. 281 Publisher bring out single  journal each whose share is 57.58 % of total OAJs published.  Commercial publishers are progressively adopting OA system  to their journals.

Content quality of the research journals is as important  as  research  itself  is.  Quality  of  scientifc  journals  is  often  measured  in  terms  of  Impact  Factor.  JCR  (Journal  Citation  Report) has been an authenticated source for determining the  IF of journals. The present study reports that as many as 87  (17.83  %)  journal  out  of  488  journal  have  been  included  in  JCR. Inclusion of OAJs in JCR is the need of the day as they  get better visibility which in turn helps to improve the quality.  Table 4 shows the top 25 OAJs in Agriculture according to the  IF provided by JCR. Frontiers in Plant Science  (4.298),  Rice (3.739)  and  Plant  Methods   (3.510)  have  recorded.  Authors  proactively considering OAJs for publishing their work may  change  the  scenario  for  OAJs  to  get  better  IF.  Increasing  adoption  of  OA  policy  to  journals  can  bring  more  visibility  which leads to increased IF. Libraries have a role to play in this  task by promoting OAJs to users and contributors.

Having  signifcant  visibility  and  effective  tools  for  the  discovery  of  the  published  work  has  been  a  great  challenge  in the world of research. Growing importance of indexing and  abstracting tools at national and International level signifes  the urge for the proper identifcation of work and ownership.  Present study records 698 source where OAJs in Agriculture are  indexed (Table 5). The sources involve diversifed databases  such  as  scientifc  databases,  library  catalogues,  repositories,  portals and directories. Google Scholar (52.46 %) found to be  most popular among OAJs in Agriculture preceded by DOAJ  which  is  the  source  database  for  the  study. cAb   Abstracts  (44.88  %)  and  Scopus  (27.46  %)  have  been  considered  by  219 and 134 journal orderly. Among the international standard  databases,  AGRIS,  World  cat,  Ebsco  Information  Service,  Latindex,  Index  Coopernicus,  Chemical Abstracts  are  found  to be considerably prominent for fnding research information  related to Agriculture.

12.  ACCeSS gAP In AgrICulture OAJS 
While measuring the gap  between the year of  journals’  establishment and provision of open access, it is realised that  many journals give open access from the very frst issue and the  rate of such journals is 58.20 %. 28 (5.74 %) OAJs come under  the gap between 1-5 year of access gap and 40 (8.20 %) OAJs  make their content available online with a gap of 11-20 year as  shown in Fig. 1. The OAJs (42; 8.61 %) fall under the category  of  more  than  50  year  is  comparatively  less. There  are  three  journal whose gap of access years has crossed 100 year and  this signifes the importance of research in Agriculture even a  century ago. OAJs in Agriculture are demonstrating the trend  of gradually making the old issues of journals available for OA  and this may fll the existing gap over a period of time. In total,  328 journal (67.42 %) are still bringing out print version of the  journals. 
figure 1. Access gap in OAJs in agriculture. 
figure 2. Open access licensing models. 
13.   lIC enSe ADOPteD  f Or OPen ACCeSS 
Creative Commons licenses have been a great platform  for channelising the open access content in distinguished levels  according to the publishers/authors’ convenience9. The present  study  fnds  that  195  (39.96  %)  OAJs  in  Agriculture  have  adopted cc by  ( creative common Attribution) license being  the highest for the distribution of content which basically allows  derivatives,  commercial  use,  and  non-share  alike  as  shown  in fig. 2. cc by  allows users to use and modify the content  with an attribution. cc by-nc  (Attribution- non commercial)  being a non-commercial license has been adopted by (19.26 %)  
358 
journals.  cc by-nc-nD  (Attribution-non-commercial-no  Derivatives) (19.47 %) which does not permit any derivatives  on the source work has been adopted by almost same amount  of journals.  
  In  the  OA  movement,  share-alike  licenses  such  as  CC  by-SA  (Attribution-Share Alike)  (8.40  %)  and cc by-nc- SA  (Attribution-Non  Commercial-Share Alike)  (5.94  %)  are  slowly gaining popularity among research communities. Since  these are viral licenses, the derived versions are unconditionally  distributed  under  the  license  of  the  source  work.  The  only  difference is that, ccby-nc-SA even prohibits the commercial  use of the work. These licenses are being famous among the  existing copyleft licenses. 5.94 % of the publishers do not rely  on any existing licenses and have adopted their own license  for the OA.  
14. APC AnD wAIver 
OA does involve some cost for the review  and  processing  of  publication.  208  (42.62  %)  OAJs in Agriculture levy charges in the name  of  APC  and  14  (2.87  %)  journals  charge  for  article  submission  fee. Article  submission  fee  is  usually  not  refunded  even  if  the  article  is  not accepted for the publication. 81 (38.94 %)  journal  out  of  total  journals  that  charge APC/ ASC  have  provision  for  waiving  off  full  or  partial fee and providing discounts on the fee.  Such  waivers  are  based  on  specifed  criteria  such  as  Low-Income/Lower-Middle  Income  Economies classifed by World bank and least  Developed  countries  listed  by united  Nations  membership.  Managements  of  some  journals  offer  discounts  and  waivers  for  authors  being  member of certain organisations and programs  such  as  Institutional  Open  Access  Program  (IOAP), Wiley Open Access. Apart from these  conditional waivers, authors have the privilege  of getting the waiver at management discretion  which is heard case by case. Generally invited  articles also are waived off from APC. APC can  be an element that infuences the author while  choosing the OAJ for publishing10.  
15.  fOrMAtS 
Among  the  OAJs  in Agriculture,  PDF  is  
the most preferred format where every journal  provides  its  content  in  PDF.  Formats  were  studied  in  two  segments  such  as  single  and  multiple.  There  are  325  OAJs  (66.6  %)  which  provide  contents  in  PDF  format  alone.  A  total of 163 journal (33.4 %) provide the contents in multiple  formats. Journals with multiple formats were separated for the  formats and each occurrence of type of format was taken into  account.  In  a  total  395  occurrence  among  the  journals  with  multiple formats for their content provision, PDF (41.27 %)  tops the list followed by HTML (35.7 %) and XML (17.72 %)  as shown in Fig. 3. PDF has been most accepted for its unique  qualities  such  as  ubiquitous  format,  ability  to  work  on  any  platform, ability to integrate non-text components, etc.

16.  PlAtfOrM 
Open  Access  Movement  has  eventually  been  thriving  towards  self  sustainability  and  this  is  evidenced  with  the  auxiliary  applications  which  facilitate  OA  also  turning  into  open source. An OAJ can be made available on Open Journal  System (OJS)11  which is an open source software under G nu General public license. OJS is a product of public Knowledge  project, a non-proft research initiative for making the results  of publicly funded research projects to be openly accessible 
12.  202 (41.39 %) OAJs in Agriculture have adopted OJS as their  platform  for  content  distribution.  Over  the  period  of  time,  OJS  is  developed  to  include  most  of  the  aspects  of  journal  management  such  as  paper  submission,  assigning  reviewer,  subscription,  provision  of  information  about  the  journal  and  module  for  accessing  articles  (OJS). The  rate  of  OAJs  with  their own platform (286; 58.61 %) is considerably more though  use rate of OJS is higher than the previous study conducted  on OAJs in Chemistry 
6. The practice of getting service from  commercial  providers  still  endures  as  it  facilitates  reduced  burdens of management and timely support and enhances the  ability  to  be  modifed  according  to  the  needs  of  publishers  though considerable amount of cost is involved in it.  
17.  ASSOCIAtIOn wIth SOCIAl MeDIA 
OAJs require more publicity for the intended information  utility and social media have been the platform for promoting  OAJs.  197  (40.37  %)  OAJs  in Agriculture  have  been  using  various applications of social media such as Facebook, Twitter,  Delicious  and  LinkedIn.  Journals  are  adopting  the  trend  of  appearing in multiple social media applications for promotion  and sharing of information. 88 (18.03 %) Journals use more  than 4 application to increase their reachability and visibility.  140 (28.69 %) OAJs provide article alert service through either  RSS (Really Simple Syndication) or emails and both. This helps  for readers to keep track of new article arrival and publication  of  new  issues. Wider  visibility  of  OAJs  has  the  potential  to  increase the adoption of OAJs. 
18.  PlAgIArISM  P OlICy 
Quality of the contents of OAJs is becoming crucial in  the recent times. Providing proper citations for the reference  
or ideas borrowed is essential as it not only makes the work  more credible and authenticated, but also connects the readers  who want to pursue the topic with wide range of sources. The  duplication  of  the  work,  a  foremost  concern  in  the  feld  of  research is now easier to detect with the plagiarism detecting  softwares in place. In the present study, 313 (64.14 %) OAJs  have  stated  their  policy  about  plagiarism.  This  gives  the  authors a caveat to maintain the level of plagiarism. Placing  prominence on plagiarism evasion even before submitting the  article signifes the importance of plagiarism policy. plagirism  detecting softwares such as Turnitin and ithenticate are popular  among the OAJs in Agriculture. 
19.  COnCluSIOnS 
The growing trend of OA to scientifc journals has become  almost unquestionable in the electronic age. The migration of  publications from commercial to OA signifes the augmentation  of sustainability of OA. The trend of bringing the back issues  of  journals  into  OA  exhibits  the  increased  positive  attitude  of publishers towards OA practice. Developing countries, by  leading in publications, are creating promising environment for  Agriculture OAJs. Charging APC/ASC is less than half of the  whole journals and this gives the authors fairly enough choices  to  choose  OAJs  for  their  articles. The  necessity  of  standard  indexing and abstracting databases to include is better realised  and this can be observed with the huge number of databases  where OAJs in Agriculture are being indexed. Quality assurance  has more signifcance in the feld of research as every single  research is built upon the previous research in the respective  discipline. Quality enhancement can be key factor in attracting  more scholars to publish their research work in OAJs. Inclusion  of  OAJs  in  JCR  like  databases  and  adherence  to  plagiarism  policy  are  ineluctably  essential  to  enhance  the  quality.  The  coexistence of quality-visibility-priority and their interrelation  are obvious in OA environment. Libraries have a great deal of  responsibility  in  OA  movement  by  promoting,  adopting  and  infuencing  OA  practice  among  users  and  authors.  With  the  predetermined standards on content quality, technology used,  adoption of licensing model for content distribution, OAJs may  extend their horizons to bring better OA environment.
