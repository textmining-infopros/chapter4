The paper examines 718 dye sensitised solar cell (DSSC) research articles published by Indian scientists  during 2011-15, which were indexed in Web of Science. It looked into the entire gamut of research performance  by  performing  sectors,  institutions,  multifarious  collaborative  aspects,  co-authorship  and  citations  etc.  Private  universities fgure among top performing institutions and nano-related aspects dominated DSSC research. DSSC  research by Indian researchers was found to be in tune with the mainstream science in the area as about 90 per cent  of the research found place in international journals published from USA, the UK and other advanced countries of  
Europe with respectable impact factor.

1. IntRoDuCtIon 
Indian government is making vigorous efforts to enhance  the  component  of  renewable  energy  in  its  total  requirement  of  energy.  Several  policy  initiatives  have  been  taken  by  the  government to harness the potential renewable energy sources.  Some of the steps include creating institutional infrastructure  like  Solar  Energy  Corporation  of  India.  Policy  initiatives  include  reduction  in  solar  power  tariff  from  Rs.  16-18  / unit to Rs. 4.3 – 4.6 /unit. Other steps include making huge  investments,  overall  157  per  cent  increase  in  solar  power  capacity,  solar  pumps  installations,  installations  of  roof  top  solar  panels,  etc.  At  the  international  level  India  has  taken  the  lead  in  the  formation  of  International  Solar Alliance  of  121  tropical  countries  with  the  objective  of  utilisation  and  promotion of solar energy in member countries with abundant  sun almost throughout the year.  
The Government of India launched a Jawaharlal Nehru  National Solar Mission (JNNSM), in 2010 which has set the  target  of  20,000  MW  of  grid  connected  electric  power  by  2022.  Of  the  four  broad  strategies  to  achieve  the  ambitious  target  is  to  undertake  aggressive  R&D.  Towards  this  end  the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of the  Government  of  India  has  also  funded  several  R&D  projects  on  solar  cell  research.  This  indicates  the  recognition  by  the  science policy planners about the crucial role of photovoltaics  in the achievement of the proposed targets under JNNSM and  otherwise to attain energy security in the country.  
A study of solar cell research in India conducted during  1991 to 2010 suggests that among various types of solar cell  research being carried out to develop a cost effective, effcient

and environment friendly solar cells, the dye-sensitised solar  cell (DSSC) is one of the candidates that is attracting lot of  research efforts1. DSSC have received widespread attention in  the recent past because of their low production cost, ease of  fabrication and optical properties2. These types of photovoltaic  cells  have  attracted  much  attention  owing  to  their  ease  of  production  from  relatively  impure  materials  as  low-cost  alternatives  to  silicon  solar  cells3.  China  has  considerably  enhanced her position in DSSC around the world4. The present  study,  therefore,  becomes  important  and  aims  to  conduct  a  scientifc  measurement  by  looking  into  the  entire  gamut  of  research and development efforts in the area of DSSC research  being  carried  out  in  India  during  2011-2015.  No  study  is  available in literature which maps DSSC research in India.   
2.  LIteRAtuRe  RevIew 
A few scientometrics studies are available that have dealt  with DSSC research. Zhang5,  et al.  have worked on innovation  in  China’s  DSSC  industry  and  found  that  China  was  the  most productive country in the feld. A bibliometric study of  solar  power  research  conducted  by  Dong6,   et  al.   observed  that globally DSSC research was increasing at an increasing  rate. Sinha7  in his study on trends in global solar photovoltaic  research found that DSSC research was a hot topic of research  and  China  was  forging  ahead  in  this  feld  of  research.  A  computer  assisted  road  mapping  study  by  Kajikawa8,   et  al.  found that DSSC was most active research topic among the  major cell subjects. Kajikawa9,  et al.  in their study on tracking  emerging technologies in energy research have observed that  dye-sensitised and organic solar cells have started emerging as  important research materials. Vegetable-based DSSC as one of  the promising research feld was identifed by Sasaki10,  et al.

in their research on emerging areas related to solar cell feld  using machine learning approach. However, there is no study  reported  in  literature  which  exclusively  focuses  on  DSSC  research in India, hence the present study. 
3.  objeCtIveS 
The following are the objectives of the study: • To examine the pattern of growth of the research output,  
its citation and co-authorship pattern;. 
• To  identify  the  performing  sectors,  prolifc  institutions  
involved  in  research  in  dye  sensitised  solar  cell  and  to  
study the citation pattern; 
• To examine international collaboration, the collaborating  
countries,  institutions  and  their  impact  in  terms  of  
citation; 
• To examine which aspects of dye sensitised solar research  
is being emphasised; 
• To  identify  highly  cited  authors,  most  frequently  used  
journals and impact factor distribution. 
4.  MethoDoLogy AnD DAtA CoLLeCtIon 
The  data  for  DSSC  for  the  period  2011  to  2015  was  downloaded on 21 June, 2016 from Web of Science, Thomson  Reuters using the query ‘dye sensitised solar cell’ or ‘dssc’.  The data was cleaned and standardised and was fed into foxpro  database  for  analysis.  The  collaboration  was  categorised  on  institutional  basis.  Those  papers  which  have  emerged  out  of  the  collaboration  among  institutions  within  the  city  have  been  termed  as  local  collaboration  (LC)  whereas  the  output  originating out of institutions located in different cities within  India has been termed as domestic collaboration (DC) and the  ones which involved institution/s from any country other than  India was defned as international collaboration (IC) whereas  those  involving  one  institution  has  been  referred  to  as  no  collaboration (NC). 
5. InDICAtoRS   u SeD 
5.1 Co-authorship  Indicators 
Different formulae are proposed by various authors are  as follows: 
One of the early measures of degree of collaboration is  collaborative index (CI) suggested by Lawani11  as: 
Collaborative Index (CI)  
= 
(∑ 
k 
i= 1 
jfj N)/ 
fj  = t he number of papers having j  authors in collection  K; 
N  = the total number of papers in K.  N = Pj fj; and 
A  = the total number of authors in collection K. 
It  is  simply  the  mean  number  of  authors  per  paper.  CI  can  be  computed  easily  at  several  levels  for  the  purpose  of  comparison  i.e.  subject-wise,  institution  and  its  department- wise, country-wise, etc. However, it is not easily interpretable  on a scale of intensity, amount or quality because mean value  (of CI) has no upper limit. 
 Degree of collaboration (DC) proposed by Subramanyam 
12 is a measure which gives fraction of multiple-authored papers  is given by: 
150 
Degree of collaboration = 
Nm Nm Ns+ 
Nm  = number of multi authored papers in the discipline  
Ns  = number of single papers in the discipline 
DC  can  also  be  calculated  and  interpreted  easily  as  a  degree.  Values  of  DC  lies  between  zero  and  one  and  gives  zero weight to single-authored papers. It ranks an entity higher  which has a higher percentage of multiple-authored papers.  
Collaboration coeffcient (CC) was proposed by Ajiferuke  and Tague13   to  remove  the  defciencies  pertaining  to  CI  and  DC. It is given by: 
Collaboration coeffcient  = 
(∑ 
A 
j=1(1/ /j fj N 
) 
) 
It  vanishes  for  a  collection  of  single-authored  papers,  
and  distinguishes  between  single  authored,  two-authored,  
multi-authored  papers.  However,  CC  fails  to  yield  1  for  
maximal  collaboration,  except  when  number  of  authors  is  
infnite. However, it should be taken equal to 1 for maximal  
collaboration. 
Relative citation impact   = 
C% 
P% 
where C  % is per cent of citations received by a unit (country  
(region),  institution  or  an  individual), P   %  is  per  cent  of  
publication  by  a  unit  (country  (region),  institution  or  an  individual) 
RCI = 1 indicates that country’s citation rate is equal to world  
citation rate;  
RCI  >  1  indicates  that  country’s  citation  rate  is  higher  than  
world’s citation rate; and  
RCI < 1 indicates that country’s citation rate is less than world’s  
citation rate. 
In this above statement word ‘country’ may be replaced  
with ‘institution’. It can be used for country as well as institution  comparison.

6.1   g rowth,  Citations  and  Co-authorship 
In  all  718  publications  were  found  to  have  originated  during  the  period  of  study  (2011-2015).  The  growth  of  publication  output  rose  tremendously  but  seems  to  have  declined  in  the  last  year.  The  reason  may  be  some  behind  the schedule journals not yet indexed by WoS, However, the  publications have been gradually increasing in absolute terms  over the 5-year period, Fig. 1.  
About 18 per cent publications did not receive any citations.  The maximum number of (~50 %) publications received two  citations. Subsequently, there was a sharp decline in quantum  of publications receiving 3-5 and higher citation ranges, Fig.  2. There was one paper which received 365 citations, the only  one that crossed the 3-digit mark. This paper was written in  Japanese  collaboration  by  a  scientist  from  CSIR-IICT  and  dealt with the high effciency aspect of DSSC. 
Collaboration indices computed are: CI=4.70, DC=0.98,  CC=0.73 
CI  is  a  measure  of  mean  number  of  authors  per  paper.  Although it is easily computable, it is not easily interpretable

as  a  degree,  for  it  has  no  upper  limit.  Moreover,  it  gives  a  non-zero weight to single-authored papers, which involve no  collaboration.  
DC is easy to calculate and easily interpretable as a degree  (for it lies between zero and one), gives zero weight to single- authored  papers,  and  always  ranks  higher  a  discipline  (or  period) with a higher percentage of multiple-authored papers.  However, DC does not differentiate among levels of multiple  authorships. DC essentially indicates fraction of multi-authored  papers. 
CC is indicated as zero for a data set containing all the  single  author  papers  and  ‘one’  for  infnite  number  of  co- authored  papers.  It  is  considered  as  more  compact  indicator  of  authorship  pattern  than  CI  and  DC,  as  it  takes  all  single  authored and multi-authored papers into consideration. 
The value of CC for the entire gamut of solar cell research  in India14  and that for global solar cell research 
15 
 is 0.64 and  compares well with DSSC research in India at 0.73, though it is  marginally higher. A study on collaboration pattern in natural  sciences16  observed that DC, CI, CC and modifed collaborative  coeffcient (MCC), all the collaboration indices indicated an  increasing trend during the period of study i.e. 1971-2007. CC  was 0 in 1971 and 0.68 in 2007. 
Single authored publications were minuscule (1.5 %) in  proportion, Fig. 3. Around 55 per cent of publications originated  out of multiple authorship comprising of 3-5 authors. However,  the  CPP  shows  only  marginal  variation  among  different  co- authorship categories from single to fve authored publications.  The substantial rise in CPP was found in the case of mega- authored publications. 
Figure 3. Co-authorship pattern and CPP. 
6.2 Research  Performing  Sectors 
The major contribution of output (90 %) emerges from  three  performing  sectors,  academic  institutions  (AI)  (61  %),  followed  by  that  from  Council  of  Scientifc  &  Industrial  Research (CSIR) (17 %) and Indian Institutes of Technology  (IITs) (11.5 %) as shown in Fig. 4. 
The  highest  citation  per  paper  (CPP)  was  observed  in  respect  of  Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DST)  followed by that of CSIR. Though AI outperformed all other  performing sectors in terms of quantum of output, however,  their citation average was relatively quite low. 
Figure 4. Research performing sectors and their citation per  
paper. 
6.3 Research  Institutions 
About  40  per  cent  of  the  output  emerged  out  of  14  institutions  which  produced  1  per  cent  or  more  of  the  total  output led by CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology  (CSIR-IICT)  followed  by  University  of  Madras,  Amrita  Vishwa Vidyapeeth, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee  (IITR), and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB) as  shown in Table 1. These fve accounted for more than half of  the output of these prominent institutions and one ffth of the  total output.  
RCI is a measure of both the infuence and visibility of a  nation’s research in global perspective. It is defned as the ratio  of a country’s share of world citations to the country’s share of  world publications.  
The highest CPP was received by CSIR-National Chemical  Laboratory  (CSIR-NCL)  followed  by  that  of  IIT-R,  Indian  Association  for  the  Cultivation  of  Science  (IACS),  Amrita  Vishwa Vidyapeeth and CSIR-IICT. All other institutions had  their CPP in single digit with the lowest being in respect of  Alagappa University (AU). An earlier 20 years study on the  entire gamut of solar cell research in India demonstrated that  IACS has been very active in photovoltaic research and has  outperformed all other institutions in India in terms of quantum  of  research  output1.  Other  prominent  research  performing  institutions in that study included IITs, AU, CSIR-IICT, etc.

6.4  Institutional  and  Country  Collaboration  
A rigorous articulation of aspects and reasons for fostering  collaboration in research has been done in their seminal work  by Katz and Martin17. The purpose for which people engage in  research  collaboration  has  also  been  elucidated  by  Beaver18.  Multi-authored  or  multi-addressed  papers  could  be  used  as  a  proxy  to  measure  collaboration  was  initially  suggested  by  Smith19.  
These  include  domestic  as  well  as  international  collaboration  work.  Publications  in  collaboration  receive  more citation than those without any collaboration. The papers  written  in  international  collaboration  receive  more  citations  than those written in domestic collaboration. This suggests that  internationally  collaborative  work  embodies  more  important  segment of the world science20. 
152 
Number of institutions involved in a research effort is also  one of the dimensions of collaborative aspect. Table 2 suggests  that  about  60  per  cent  of  the  output  involved  two  or  more  institutions. It is also observed that the larger the number of  institutions more is the likelihood of higher citations, however,  the trend does not sustain beyond a point. Fig. 5 depicts the  distribution  of  total  output  in  terms  of  different  nature  of  collaborative aspects i.e. NC, LC, DC, and IC.

Figure 5. nature of collaboration and CPP. 
We see that about 40 per cent of the research output has  emerged  without  any  institutional  collaboration  designated  as NC. About 5 per cent of publications have resulted out of  LC and about 15 per cent originated out of DC. In all these  three  categories  of  collaborative  aspects  the  CPP  exhibited  only  marginal  variation,  which  implied  that  the  indigenous  collaboration  did  not  substantially  result  in  changes  in  CPP.  However,  the  research  output  originated  out  of  IC  efforts  exhibited CPP more than twice that of DC. 
Solar cell research is a frontier area of research endeavor  where most of the countries which intend to go green in their  energy  requirements  are  involved  in  grappling  the  R&D  problems.  Finding  new  materials,  improve  effciency  and  develop cost-effective solar cells are the core problems, and  hence,  there  may  be  synergistic  outcome  in  collaboration  among different countries, institutions and researchers.  
Of the entire gamut of collaboration 40 per cent of the  output  emerged  as  a  result  of  IC  where  34  countries  were  involved. The prominent lead international linkages have been  with twenty countries which included South Korea, Taiwan,  Japan, Greece and Saudi Arabia. However, twenty countries led  the research with South Korea being the dominant international  collaborative partner, followed by Taiwan, Greece, Switzerland  and Italy as shown in Fig. 6.   
In  all  there  were  7526  keywords  which  were  highly  scattered  and  a  large  number  of  them  appeared  disjointed.  However, an effort was made to standardise the same and draw  some inference as to the direction and emphasis of research

Aspects  related  to  ‘nano’,  ‘effciency’,  ‘electrodes  and  electrolytes’,  ‘performance’, ‘conversion’, ‘flms’, ‘dyes and pigments’ etc.  are some of the dimensions of research worked upon by the  R&D scientists engaged in DSSC research in India.

Dye-sensitised  solar  cell  (DSSC)  research  in  India  as  refected  in  Web  of  Science  during  2011-15  showed  a  gradual  rising  trend. About  18  per  cent  publication  did  not  receive any citations. Academic institutions outperformed all  other  performing  sectors,  however,  their  Citations  per  paper  (CPP) was relatively lower. The Department of Science and  Technology received highest CPP. A  few  private institutions  like  Sharda  University  and  Amritha  Vishwa  Vidyapeeth  University fgured among top performing institutions and had  respectable  CPP.  These  are  relatively  new  institutions  and  have  demonstrated  research  capability  in  the  area  of  DSSC.  However, Council of Scientifc and Industrial Research-Indian  Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) outperformed  all other institutions with double digit CPP. Two ffths of the  output emerged out of international collaboration (IC) with 34  countries and the CPP of IC output was twice that of indigenous  output. The DSSC research by Indian researchers is a part of  the international mainstream research in the areas as about 80  per  cent  publications  have  appeared  in  journals  originating  from  USA,  UK,  Netherlands,  Switzerland  and  Germany  with  impressive  impact  factor.  The  direction  and  emphasis  of research appeared to be on aspects of ‘nano’, ‘effciency’,  ‘electrodes  &  electrolytes’,  ‘performance’  and  ‘conversion’,  etc. This study shall also facilitate the library professionals and  academicians to identify right journal in feld of DSSC.
