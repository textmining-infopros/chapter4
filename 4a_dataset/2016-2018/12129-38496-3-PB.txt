AbstrAct 
The  paper  provides  quantitative  and  qualitative  description  of  mobile  commerce  research,  as  covered  in  Scopus database during 2007-16. Mobile commerce research registered 7.29  per cent growth, and averaged 3.78  citations per paper. The global output in mobile commerce research in 10 years was 4803 publications but just  top 10 countries contributed bulk of (80.66 %) global publications share and 90.39 per cent global citations share  during the period.  China (with 30.0 per cent global publications share) is the world leader in mobile commerce  research, followed by USA (15.59 % share) and others. The paper also provide information on their relative citation  index, their international collaborative publications share, activity index of sub-felds in mobile commerce research  and bibliographic characteristics of 25 highly cited paper. The paper also reports on top 20 most productive global  organisations and authors in mobile commerce research and describes their characteristics on a series of parameters.  The study concludes that mobile commerce research is still in its early stages of growth and development and not  growing fast, as fast as mobile penetration. There is a need to provide institutional funding and policy support to  R&D institutions to accelerate research growth, build and strengthen their research capacities, and encourage national  and international research collaboration in this important area.

1.  IntroductIon 
Mobile  commerce  aka  m-commerce  refers  to  retail  marketing  via  mobile  devices,  allowing  retailers  and  consumers  to  trade  and  interact  on  wireless  networks  using  smartphones, iPads, and tablets. Mobile devices are equipped  with computing power, mobile applications, payment gateways  interfaces, and web-ready micro browsers which allow mobile  communication,  internet  browsing,  and  processing  business  transactions  for  shopping  and  selling  of  goods  and  services  and digital payments online. Mobile commerce is a sub-area  of  e-commerce  and  hence  it  is  also  referred  to  as  wireless  e-commerce. Conceptually, m-commerce is a fusion of mobile  communication  and  online  retailing.  Mobile  communication  refers  to  wireless  broadband  internet  connectivity,  24x7  connectivity  anytime,  anywhere,  via  any  mobile  device,  whereas  online  commerce  refers  to  mobility  and  fexibility  to  perform  business  transactions  and  fnancial  payments  in  a  wireless  environment.  M-commerce  services  includes  online purchases, promotion, mobile advertising, relationship  building  activities,  and  customer  support.  With  an  array  of  e-services,  m-commerce  is  heading  towards  rapid  growth  even  in  developing  countries  and  radically  transforming  the  way we do business, transact, access and conduct our personal  shopping, businesses and fnances. The major factors driving  m-commerce growth include mobile technology innovations,

mobile apps for commerce and digital payments, exponential  growth  in  consumer  demand,  online  customer  support,  real  time data transfer, evolution of a new value chain, and access  to retail transactions data and information. M-commerce as a  discipline is into research pursuits in frontier technologies like  wireless communication technologies, mobile devices, wireless  networks, wireless platforms, mobile payment gateways, and  mobile platforms, infrastructure and applications1-2 
1.1  Literature review 
Mobile  commerce  being  a  discipline  of  recent  origin,  quantitative  research  studies  pursued  till  date  in  this  area  only  few.  In  a  bibliographic  analysis  study  Hew3   evaluated  mobile commerce research across countries on indicators like  publication  productivity,  impact  factor,  h-index,  and  citation  counts by contributing countries, journals, authors, and research  institutions. In addition, the author reported most cited articles  and most studied mobile commerce applications. Chang and  Wang4  analysed 4821 paper on mobility that were published  1995 to 2013 and as indexed in the Web of Science database.  Using  co-word  analysis  technique,  the  authors  discussed  inter-relationship  among  mobile  computing,  commerce  and  applications from the perspective of their future implications  as to how such areas are likely to gain prominence over the  next few years. Nagai and Gunasekaran5 reviewed 149 paper  on m-commerce and reported gap between theory and practice  under fve broad categories: i) m-commerce theory and research,  ii) wireless network infrastructure, iii) mobile middleware, iv)

2.    o bjectIves 
The study seeks to undertake a quantitative and qualitative  analysis of mobile commerce research across the world. The  data  for  the  study  has  been  sourced  from  Scopus  database  covering 10 year period 2007-16. The broad objectives of the  study are:  
• To  study  mobile  commerce  research  growth,  country-  
wise  contribution  to  international  collaborative  
research,  and  identify  top  10  productive  countries  in  
this area 
•  To distribute mobile commerce research by sub- areas  in  
the subject, and report signifcant keywords  
characterising mobile commerce research 
• To study publication productivity and citation impact of  
top 20 organisations and authors 
• To study the medium of research communication and  • To study the bibliographic characteristics of highly cited  
papers.  
3.  MethodoLoGy 
The  mobile  commerce  publications  were  identifed,  retrieved,  and  downloaded  using  the  Scopus  database,  an  international  multidisciplinary  publications  and  citations  database  (http://www.scopus.com)  covering  10  years  period  2007-16. A  search  string  was  formulated  to  identify  mobile  commerce-related  publications  which  contained  search  terms  such  as  “mobile  commerce’’  or  ‘’m-commerce’’  or  ‘’mcommerce”  duly  prefxed  with  ”Article  title  tag”  and  “keywords tag” and restricted the search to the period 2007- 16 in “date range tag”. The search resulted into 4803 global  publications on mobile commerce-related research during 2007- 16. Further, the above search output was refned by country  to  identify  top  10  productive  countries  by  sufxing  country  name to “country tag” The global publications output was also  refned by subject, collaborating countries, organisation-wise,  author-wise and journal-wise, and others by using analytical  provisions/tags as available in Scopus database. For citation data  analysis, citations to publications were collected from date of  their publication till 29 December 2016. The publications data  was analysed across a series of raw and relative bibliometric  indicators with a view to understand the dynamics of global  research in mobile commerce. In data analysis, the authors used  complete counting method wherein every contributing author  or organisation covered in multiple authorship papers was fully  counted. All authors or organisations to multi-authored papers  have received equal credit in data counting and analysis.

5.    s uMMAry And concLusIons  
Mobile  commerce  is  an  emerging  area  of  research  involved mainly in studies exploring new mobile commerce  applications, technologies, and devices such as wireless user  infrastructure,  wireless  network  infrastructure  and  mobile  middleware. Though mobile commerce research studies have  spread  across  as  many  as  161  countries,  however  bulk  of  global output (80.66 %) in this feld comes mainly from just 10  top countries only. China leads the ranking with 30.0 % global  publications  share,  followed  distantly  by  USA  with  15.59  % share. The top 20 global organisations and top 20 authors  account  for  13.74  %  and  3.62  %  global  publications  share  respectively. The global citation impact of mobile commerce  research in 10 year averaged to just 3.78 citations per paper and  highly cited papers account for just 0.52 % share. Given such  discouraging qualitative and quantitative trends, it is evident  that  mobile  commerce  research  is  still  in  its  early  stages  of  growth and development and not growing fast, as fast as mobile  penetration.  Recognising  that  mobile  commerce  research  has major potential to transform and push countries towards  the  path  of  cashless  and  digital  economy,  major  developing  countries  like  India  should  resolve  to  provide  institutional
