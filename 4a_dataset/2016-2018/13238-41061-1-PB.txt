The present study aims to study the research articles published in DESIDOC Journal of Library & Information  Technology   during  2008-2017  with  a  gender  perspective.  Infuence  of  gender  was  assessed  at  individual  and  collaborative levels, professional engagement and citedness. The fndings reveal increase in the overall presentation  of male authors i.e. 401 (75.38 %) compared to female authors 131 (24.62 %) of total of 532 authors. 345 (64.85  %) are multiple authored articles compared to 187 (35.15 %) single authored papers. Collaborative pattern of male- male authors with 205 (38.83 %) articles, followed by articles contributed by male solo authors with 160 (30.08  %) authors, outnumbers all other collaborative authorship patterns. A chi square value of (x2 = 11.801, p = 0.003)  shows signifcant difference in the number of contributions by both male and female authors engaged in different  LIS profession. The fndings prove that men are over represented in the whole LIS community.

1.  InTrODuCTIOn 
Research  has  become  a  vital  activity  in  every  feld  of  knowledge. Bibliometrics is an emerging thrust area of research  in different branches of human knowledge since its inception.  It has now become well established art of information research.  A quantitative approach to the description of documents and  examination of services is gaining ground both in research and  practice1. 
Bibliometrics  is  an  approach  based  on  quantitative  characteristics,  attributes  or  objects  of  documentary  fows.  It is primarily based on the analysis of bibliographic data on  publications. A  principle  assumption  underlining  the  use  of  bibliometric indicators is that scholars publish their research  fndings in available literature and that one may obtain pictures  of scholarly activities from quantitative analysis of scholarly  documents2. 
Numerous studies and data exist from all over the world  in scientifc felds, analysing male-female publication output.  The  careful  analysis  of  research  contribution  in  the  form  of  scholarly  publication  can  provide  deep  insights  for  making  inter-institution,  inter-feld  and  international  comparison  of  research performance. There are very few studies undertaken  in India which gives an insight to the publishing trend in LIS  journal literature with a gender perspective.

favour of women. 
The  gender  gap  investigated  on  cross-sectional  sample  publications  and  authorships  in  the  feld  of  management  research, a marginal difference was found in citation impact in  favour of women management scholars3. The study conducted  on Web of Science (WoS) extracting publication data of Iranian  women  contributions  in  the  area  of  science  and  technology.  There  was  no  gender  difference  found  between  pure  and  applied felds of science. The fndings emphasised on quality  of research to improve female scientifc productivity and their  citation score4. 
In the discipline of physics 44 women faculties and their  802  publications  were  studied  during  the  period  2011-2015.  The analysis showed that, majority of women authors preferred  to be second author in collaborative authorship5. 
The  scientifc  profle  of  Indian  publication  output  in  Life sciences with reference to women revealed that women  scientists  emphasised  on  the  sub-discipline  of  cell  biology  and reproductive biology and male scientists emphasised on  the  sub-discipline  of  zoology.  Women  scientists  have  few  international collaborative papers with less number of citations6.  The  contributions  to  science  was  explored  from  University  of  Kashmir  in  terms  of  gender  differences  across  various  disciplines  and  parameters  selected  were  gender  variation,  gender  repetition,  etc7. The  performance  of  women  in  Nano  science & Technology using a scientometric method in terms  of their scientifc productivity and impact were compared. The  fndings revealed over-representation of males in the feld of  Nano science & Technology8. 
A study conducted on Iranian women and their international  scientifc production based on twenty-two broad ISI felds. It

showed that women are less active in economics, business and  space  sciences  compared  to  science. Although  in  respect  to  quality of research output and level of impact no difference was  found9.  The  career  prospects  for  Swedish  female  professors  concluded that women are signifcantly less likely than men  to  become  professors  and  this  situation  has  not  improved  overtime10. Gender differences were identifed in publication  output  of  Nigerian  university  librarians.  The  study  revealed  that male LIS professionals published more than their female  counterparts. The major reason found for low productivity of  females was related to family responsibilities11. 
The  research  community  working  in  the  science- technological  disciplines  of  Italian  university  system  was  examined to identify the differences between the sexes. The  reasons for gender differences in research and its related factors  found were e.g., age, maternity, marriage, children and level of  specialisation12. Gender differences among Iranian researchers’  publication activity concluded that females lagged behind in  scientifc production compared to males13. The world’s best six  multi-disciplinary journals examined female publication output  across key disciplines and found no gender difference in Journal  Impact Factor ratings, although differences occurred in quality  of research discipline-wise rather than due to gender bias14. The  reasons identifed for undertaking comparative studies based  on gender were, frstly the assessment of scientifc research,  is crucial, which is communicated through publications. And  secondly,  given  the  gender  inequality  in  academic  status,  promotions and income, it would be diffcult, to evaluate or  improve the current situation, without investigating the gender  differences and their underlying factors15. 
The participation of women researchers in The Electronic  Library   observed  that  the  results  were  no  different  when  compared  with  similar  other  studies  which  showed  overall  increase in male scholarly publication16. 
The  LIS  research  trends  found  Nigerian  authors  as  the  largest contributor in a study carried in Africa, during 1991- 200217.  The  publishing  patterns  between  male  and  female  PhDs in librarianship revealed that women are just as likely to  publish as men18-19. 
The  review  of  literature  on  women’s  scholarly  activity  and  production,  indicates  low  academic  performance  of  females both in developing as well as developed world with  few exceptions. 
2.1  Statement  of  the  Problem 
Gender differences in terms of scientifc productivity need  to be monitored in the twenty frst century, when the whole  world is talking about women empowerment and emancipation.  This study examines the position of female researchers against  male researchers in the feld of LIS in the DESIDOC Journal of  Library & Information Technology  during 2008-2017. 
3.  ObJECTIvES 
The  aim  of  the  present  investigation  is  to  examine  LIS  literature  with  a  gender  perspective  as  refected  in  the  publication  output  reported  during  2008-2017  in DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  &  Information  Technology.  The  present  investigation aims to study the research contributions of both  
the gender in terms of following sub-objectives 
• To determine the rate of growth of LIS literature; • To focus on LIS trends including topics and cited papers; • To  assess  relationship  between  author  productivity  and  
professional engagement; 
• To identify different felds in LIS where male and female  
researchers concentrate; 
• To fnd authorship pattern so as to calculate the level of  
collaboration  from  the  gender  perspective  amongst  the  
following fve combinations: Male single author; Female  
single  author;  male-Female  author;  male-male  author;  
Female-Female author 
• To identify gender distribution in national and international  
collaboration; 
• To ascertain male and female prolifc authors; • To determine citation variation across genders. 
3.1  Hypotheses  of  the  Study 
h1. There is no difference between research productivity of  
male and female researchers. 
h2.  Research productivity of male and female authors is not  
dependent on their professional status. 
h3.  Numbers  of  publications  produced  in  national  and  
international collaboration are independent of the gender  
of contributing authorship collaborations. 
h4.  Citedness of articles is independent of the type of gender- 
wise authorship pattern. 
4.    rESEA rCH  M ETHODOLOGy 
The  present  study  applies  bibliometric  method  with  a  comparative  approach,  to  study  contribution  of  male  and  female  LIS  professionals  in  DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  &  Information  Technology   during  2008-2017.  Although  the  journal  lists  introduction,  book  reviews  etc.  only  research  articles  are  taken  into  consideration  as  research  output. The  information  regarding  the  respective  author’s  gender  and  their  professional  engagements  have  been  taken  from  the  introductory notes provided at the end of the article. Scopus  database  was  consulted  on march  2017  and  again  data  was  updated  on  march  2018  to  gather  information  on  citations  received by the journal articles being studied.  
For the purpose of the study frst author has been considered  as  principal  author  and  to  analyse  different  collaborative  authorship patterns, frst and second authors were studied. The  author collaboration was broadly studied under two categories  national and international. The frst author’s affliation either  male/female was identifed and assigned the type of institution  category, country’s name from which the article was contributed  and the name of institution was analysed to fnd out institution  productivity  as  well.  Furthermore,  the  professional  status  of  authors  is  examined  under  three  categories  teaching,  non- teaching and research scholar. An author involved in teaching  in university is classifed as teacher. Non-teacher is involved in  the profession as a practicing librarian in research institutions,  university  library  and  other  information  or  resource  centers.  Research scholar engaged as a researcher in university or in  a  research  institution.  Subject  distribution  of  authors  is  also  studied.

mS Excel was used for analysing the data downloaded. The  data as collected was analysed using IBmSPSS20 software. A  chi square test was applied to analyse the relationship between  male  and  female  contribution,  teaching-non-teaching  ratio,  collaboration etc. 
5.1 yearly  Contribution  of Authors  by  Gender 
Table 1 reveals the yearly distribution of male and female  authors. In total of 532 authors, 401 (75.38 %) researchers are  males and 131 (24.62 %) female. Thus, as shown in Table 1,  there has been greater proportion of male authors compared to  female authors during the study period. 
5.2  The  Comparison  of  Male  and  Female  
researchers’  Frequencies 
A chi-square test performed observed signifcant difference  between male and female research output at 5 % signifcance  level (x2  = 137.030, p = 0.000) and that female contributions  was signifcantly lower than male. Hence, the null hypothesis  is rejected as shown in Table 2. 
5.3 Average  Distribution  of Authors  by  Gender 
In Table 3, analysis of data shows that average number  of  male  authors  per  article  was  0.75  (AmPP)  ranging  from  a minimum of one to maximum of seven. On the other hand  average number of female authors per article was 0.25.

5.5 research  Productivity  and  Gender wise  
Professional  Engagement 
Of the total of 532 authors, most of them (333) belong  to non-teaching profession followed by teaching professionals  (171)  and  research  scholars  (28). As  evident  from  Table  6,  as  level  of  signifcance  is  less  than  5  per  cent  there  exists  statistically signifcant difference in the number of contributions  made  by  male  and  female  authors  engaged  in  different  LIS  profession (x2  = 11.801, p = 0.003).  hence, the null hypothesis  is rejected. 
5.6  Collaborative works  and nature  of  
Collaboration  in  different Authorship  Patterns 
Table  7,  analysed  the  works  produced  in  national  and  international collaboration in four different authorship patterns.  Of the total 339 works, 307 (90.56 %) works were produced  with  national  collaboration  and  32(8.65  %)  works  resulted  from  international  collaboration.  There  exists  no  signifcant  
difference  between  national  and  international  contributions  made by different collaborative authors (x2  = 1.986, p= 0.575).  hence the null hypothesis is accepted. 
5.7   r esearch Article  Distribution  by  Gender 
The  data  analysis  of  Table  8  showed  that  the  highest  ranked  research  area  in  which  male  authors  contributed  is  Scientometrics  with  38  (9.47  %)  at  frst  place  followed  by  Bibliometrics 33 (8.22 %). Library Use studies was preferred  by 25 (6.23 %) of the authors at third place. Research articles  on the subject of Library software and user study ranked fourth  and ffth respectively. Table 8b represents the research areas  in which females contribute. The frst ranked topic being LIS  education with 13 (9.92 %) females. The second most preferred  topic was Bibliometrics and Library Use studies with 12 (9.16  %) females scored second place and the other two subject areas  were Scientometrics 10 (7.63 %) and Library Software with 5  (3.81 %) female researchers in it.

It  is  diffcult  to  understand  gender  bias  and  its  related  causes  which  are  related  to  gender  equity  in  research  productivity  across  disciplines  in  different  parts  of  the  world23. According  to  more  recent  research  results  analysed  women’s  scientifc  production  has  increased  in  quantitative  terms in some disciplines though differences exists in overall  representation  of  women  in  academia24-25. Although  there  is  growing  participation  of  women  in  research  and  academic  activities in the western world, but equal status across gender  is still a distant dream26.  
The  results  of  the  present  study  shows  that  males  outperform females in the LIS publication output of DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  &  Information  Technology  during  the  studied period. Further research is required to understand the  issues that hamper academic women research productivity in  the feld of Library and Information Science.
