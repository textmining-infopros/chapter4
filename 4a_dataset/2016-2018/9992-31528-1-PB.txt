AbstrAct 
Extensive studies have been conducted on Webometric, particularly on the websites and the web impact factor.  The present study analysed the websites of Deemed universities in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It examines 7  Deemed university websites and identifes number of web pages and link pages, and calculates Web Impact Factor  (WIF) using Google search engine. The websites were ranked based on these Webometric indicators. The study  revealed that websites of Andhra Pradesh Universities have more number of web-pages but Telangana University  websites have high web impact factor in most of the parameters.  
Keywords: Deemed universities, webometric, web impact factor (WIF)  
1.  IntroDUctIon 
Webometric is an attractive and one of most relevant  info-metric sub-discipline among traditional bibliometrics  approaches1.  The  availability  of  reliable  web  data  is  important  to  achieve  standard  results,  despite  of  tool  related technical problems and intermediaries required for  web data recovery. Through Webometric studies one can  observe  that  how  users  actually  react  and  use  specific  web  document2.  The  aims  of  most  Webometric  studies  are to validate links as a new information source and to  measure its impact on official or in-formal connections.  Almost  all  Deemed  universities  of Andhra  Pradesh  and  Telangana have their own websites to provide a view of  functioning of the Organisation. But, despite the scale of  involvement,  there  has  been  relatively  little  analysis  of  contents and visibility of their websites. This brings us to  an unavoidable stand wherein an analysis of the linking  and  visibility  of  these  websites  has  become  extremely  vital. Due to the strong regional impact, there is a need  for  conducting  research  on  location  of  websites  and  the  links of the seven Deemed universities in Andhra Pradesh  and Telangana. The study identifies the domain systems  of  the  websites;  analyses  the  number  of  web-pages  and  link pages, and calculates the simple Web Impact Factor  (WIF), Self Link Web Impact Factor (SLWIF), External  Link Web Impact Factor (ELWIF), and In-Link Web Impact  Factor (ILWIF) for the Deemed University websites under  study  and  ranks  the  websites  according  to  WIF.  Figure  1  illustrates  noteworthy  areas  of  Webometric  analysis.  Significant  spots  of  webometric  analysis3: 
(a) Web-content analysis involves automatic classification  
of  web-pages  and  text  by  various  search  engines  
and  tools  for  analysis 
(b) Web-link structure analysis deals with hyperlinks of  
particular website, patterns of linking like self-links,  
external  links,  in-links,  etc. 
(c) Web-usage analysis employed for searching user log  
file  and  browsing  behaviour  
(d) Web-technology  analysis  focuses  on  search  engine  
performance closely associated with the information  
retrieval  supporting  webometric  analysis.

The study found that WIF and R-WIF  are  correlated  and  associated  indicating  less  difference  between the two ranking methods. The authors stated that  the position of library websites of half HEIs of India is  same while evaluating through both the formulas.

Table 4 shows the classification of Deemed universities  by  the  domain  name.  Among  7  Deemed  Universities  under  study,  two  Government  Universities,  1  in  each  state respectively have the domain name .ac.in; 2 private  universities have the domain name .org; 3 private universities  of Andhra Pradesh have their domain name .edu.in, .edu  respectively.  WIF  is  a  measure  of  the  frequency  with  which a web-page of a website is linked at a given point  in  time.  A  higher  WIF  represents  greater  reputation  of  a  website28. 
It was observed from Table 5 Sri Sathya Sai Institute  of  Higher  Learning  (SSSIHL)  has  maximum  number  of  pages  followed  by  Gandhi  Institute  of  Technology  and  Management. It could be noted that International Institute  of  Information  Technology  (IIIT)  has  majority  number  of link pages followed by ICFAI Foundation for Higher  Education with 268000 web-pages. Ingwersen29 proposed an  innovative measurement for calculating the online impact  
and  analysing  their  out  links  and  in-links.  The  ratio

(WIF) determines the average online impact of a website  
by dividing the number of link pages (b) by the number  is  called  web  impact  factor  (WIF),  which  reflects  its  
of  web-pages  (A).  International  Institute  of  Information  
Technology (IIIT) secures the first position with WIF of  
global  fame  and  the  quality  of  information  resources  it  provides. Data collection was conducted in August 2015,  in order to limit errors commonly associated with regular  website  updates. The  investigator  employed  simple  web  impact  factor  in  order  to  compare  the  universities  web  influences. Table 3 provide expansion for acronyms and  calculate WIF  formula  used  in  this  study. 
46.42. ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education occupies  second  rank  with  the  WIF  of  3.71.  A  minimum  WIF  gained  by koneru  Lakshmaiah  Education  Foundation  (kLEF)  (0.99)  and  ranked  sixth. 
The  author  perceived  from  Table  6  that  IIIT  has  the  utmost  number  of  self-link  web-pages  (SLWP),

Figure  2  provides  an  idea  about  the  overall  web  impact  factor  for  Deemed  university  websites  under  study;  found  from  the  bar  graph  that  IIIT  has  achieved  maximum web impact factor; it is direct from the study  that IIIT is the only institution, which have more number  of  link  pages  hence  maximum  web  impact  factor. 
Following measures are suggested to improve university  websites: 
(a) Each  university  and  their  website(s)  may  have  
necessities  that  are  essential  and  unique. 
(b) Providing  intranet  facility  in  university  in  order  to  
document and disseminate information effectively. In

addition,  intranet  also  makes  available  the  general  
community within the institution a chance to influence  
decisions being made. At the very least, it will serve  
to  increase  awareness  of  what’s  happening. 
(c) It  is  very  important  to  receive  feedback  from  user  
community.  This  takes  advantage  of  the  impetuous  
nature  of  users.  It  is  also  essential  to  make  sure  
people  are  being  listened  to.  
(d) The target audiences for any particular page have to  
be  clear  and  well-planned.  Target  audience  include  
students  (Current  students,  potential  students,  past  
students (alumni), staff members and staff-like members  
(e.g.,  postgraduate  students),  teachers  (academics,  
tutors, practical demonstrators), general staff members,

measuring  tools  search  engines  for  data  collection,  and  qualitative  methods  such  as  interpretation  of  web  links  and classification of link creation motivations.  Generally,  web  link  analysis  of  deemed  university  websites  is  trustworthy,  but  practically  web  links  are  unequal  to  citations  in  the  scholarly  literature,  since  university  content  sites  include  related  academic  cites.  This  study  reflects  a  direct  relationship  with  the  related  links.  The  institutions having more number of link pages obviously  encompass more impact factor. The study observed that,  IIIT  owing  to  possess  more  websites  hence,  comprise  maximum  web  impact  factor  among  deemed  university  websites  of Andhra  Pradesh  and Telangana. 
are  constantly  changing,  being  a  main  obstacle  for  Webometrics  studies.  For  instance,  Altavista  and  most  of the web in-link search methods do not work anymore.  In  fact,  Webometrics  research  area  suffers  from  lack  of  the  appropriate  and  stable  measuring  tools.  It  the  future challenges of Webometrics related to quantitative  methods such as sampling the web-pages and web links
