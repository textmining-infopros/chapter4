1. IntroductIon 
The institutions belonging to the higher education sector  taken together are the biggest contributors to India’s academic  research output. University rankings are now taken seriously.  The  frst  global  university  rankings  became  available  in  2003  by  Shanghai  Jiao  Tong  University,  now  known  as  the  Academic  Ranking  of  World  Universities  (ARWU).    Three  Indian  institutions  appeared  in  the  world  rankings  in  2003  were Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru in the 251– 300 bracket and the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) at  Delhi and Kharagpur in the 451–500 bracket. The Shanghai  ARWU rankings are based mainly on research indicators, as  are many other similar rankings, e.g. the Leiden rankings, the  Taiwan  Higher  Education  Accreditation  Evaluation  Council  University  Ranking,  and  the  EU Assessment  of  University- Based Research. The European University Association report  confrms that most international rankings focus predominantly  on indicators related to the research function of universities.  It is therefore meaningful in the present exercise to focus on  the  research  contributions  of  higher  educational  institutions  (HEIs) in India1-2. 
These  research-intensive  institutions  belonging  to  the  higher education sector are the biggest contributor to India’s  academic  research  output.  Measuring  scientifc  research  competence  of  institutions  has  always  been  considered  a  challenging but useful exercise. It is now generally accepted  that institutions of higher education and research need to be  subjected  to  some  benchmarking  process  or  performance

evaluation  time  to  time  which  highlighted  the  strength  and  inspire to hold rank nationally and globally3-4. 
In  India  the  National  Institutional  Ranking  Framework  (NIRF)  approved  by  Ministry  of  Human  Resource  and  Development  ranked  the  universities  across  the  country  based on ‘Teaching, Learning and Resources,’ ‘Research and  Professional  Practices,’  ‘Graduation  Outcomes,’  ‘Outreach  and Inclusivity,’ and ‘Perception’. Banaras Hindu University  ranked third among top universities in the NIRF. 
In  recent  years,  three  dimensional  (3-D)  bibliometric  analysis  has  been  used  by  Prathap5   to  identify  the  leading  countries, organisations and authors and the most infuential  journals  in  the  area  of  monsoon  research.  A  bibliometric  profling of Current Science based on quantitative indicators  identifed  the  most  productive  authors,  cities  and  states  that  have  published  articles  and  notes  in  Current  Science  in  the  recent past6. Dwivedi7  evaluated Indian dengue research and  global dengue research8  through the primary 3-D measures of  quality,  quantity,  consistency  and  two  secondary  indicators,  the h index and z index. In the present paper. Author made an  attempt to evaluate research performance of the Banaras Hindu  University  using  a  3-D  method. The  data  for  the  study  was  retrieved from Web of Science database for the period 1989  to 2016.  
Research performance is modelled by a simple heuristic  ‘thermodynamic’  model9-11   that  complemented  the  quantity  and quality dimensions with a third dimension, consistency, ƞ,  to allow a better 3-D evaluation of the information-production  process. The parallel used was the ‘3Vs’ metaphor of Laney12 on 3-D data management, in which the number of papers, P,

indicated  volume;  the  quality  (or  impact i),  as  measured  by  the  ratio C/P,  where C is  the  total  number  of  citations  received  by P papers,  indicated  the  velocity  with  which  the  ideas  in P papers  are  communicated  through  citations C,  and  consistency  ƞ  indicated  the  variety  (variability)  in  the  quality  of  the  individual  papers  in  the  publication  set  or,  in  other words, the shape of the distribution curve. By using all  three components together, a z-index can be computed from  an  energy-like  term  (Z=ƞ X=ƞ2E)  as z=Z1/3,  which  has  the  same dimensions as the number of publications. X is energy  and E is  energy5-6,  so  it  is  possible  to  imagine  a  phantom  indicator named zynergy for Z=ƞ X=ƞ2E. This phantom index  combines quantity, quality, and consistency (or effciency) in  the  true  spirit  of  3D  evaluation. The  accurate  calculation  of  consistency (ƞ) requires the complete citation sequence, (i.e.  the  distribution  curve)  for  country,  organisation,  author  or  journal.

Several indicators have been used to express performance  of scientifc output of an individual, institution, or an entity.  Scientifc  performance  of  individual  or  an  entity  can  be  measured by using different parameters.  
2.1 Quantity 
Number  of  papers/articles  ‘P’  published  during  a  prescribed window will be called publication window (for this  study the window is from 1989 to 2016). A fve-year citation  window is considered for each year.  
2.2 Quality  and consistency 
Quality  denotes  citation  per  paper,  calculated  as  C/P where C is the number of citations during a prescribed citation  window.  The  quality  measurement  needed  two  separate  windows, the publication window and the citation window. In  3-D evaluation of performance measurement after computing  quantity P  and quality  i  parameters, it is possible to derive other  indicators by following these sequences. P= i0P  (zero 
th-order  indicator), C= i1P  (frst-order indicator),  X= i2P = iC  (second- order indicator), where C = Σcj,   j  = 1 to  P. 
C  is derived from complete citation sequence,  cj  of the  citation of each paper in a publication portfolio of P  papers  as the total number of citations, C=∑cj, for j=1 to P.  Both P and C  serve as indicators of performance in their respective  ways.  If C=iP   may  be  assumed  as  the  frst-order  indicator  for  performance,  the  exergy  indicator X=  i2P,  is  an  energy  like  quantity  which  serves  as  a  second  order  indicator  of  performance.  This  model  leads  to  a  trinity  of  energy-  like  terms5, 13-14 
X = i2P, E = Σc2j , S = Σ  (c 
2 
j-i) 
 = E-X .  
The  h-index  is  observed  by  ordering  the  citation  in  a  decreasing  sequence15.  Highly  cited  papers  are  seen  to  be  concentrated  in  a  small  region,  possibility  of  huge  variation  in  the  quality  of  papers  in  the  publication  set. According  to  Prathap11, in case of  high skews, the product X=iC=i2P, which  is a second-order indicator is a better proxy for performance than  C  itself. Apart from  X, an additional indicator E  also appears  
404 
as a second- order indicator as seen above. The existence of  both proxies X  and  E  allows to introduce third proxy named  as consistency (variability) ƞ=X/E. When X=E, i.e., ƞ=1, the  condition indicates for the perfect consistency means uniform  performance  (all  papers  have  the  same  number  of  citations,  cj=c). The  inverse  of  consistency  gives  the  concentration  of  best work in few papers of extraordinary impact. Thus, for a  complete 3-D evaluation of publication activity, one needs P,  i, and ƞ. These are the three primary components of a quantity- quality-consistency landscape.

Data is retrieved from Science Citation Index-Expanded  for  Organisation=(Banaras  Hindu  University)  for  the  period  1989-2016.  Data  downloaded  in  Excel  sheets  on  various  parameters that needed to unfold the data three-dimensionally.  From all the related articles P  and Citation  C  are computed for  this study. Then all the indicators quality, quantity, consistency  for  various  year,  various  subject  feld  and  collaborative  countries are counted on excel sheets. By using all the three  indicators together, z index can be calculated from an energy  like  term  (Z=ɳX=  ɳ2E).  This  z  index  is  the  combination  of  quantity, quality and consistency (or effciency), provide truly  3D evaluation of scholarly publications. It may be assumed P,  i and ɳ as primary indicators and h and z index are secondary,  composite indicators. 
4.   r ESuLtS And dIScuSSIonS 
A  total  of  17367  records  are  retrieved.  These  records  included  all  types  of  documents  like  articles,  article  proceedings,  article  book  chapter,  biographical  item,  book  review,  corrections,  discussions,  editorial  materials,  letter,  meeting abstract, news items, notes, reprints, review. The total  16556  records  covering  articles,  article  proceedings,  letter,  and  reviews  are  taken  in  this  assessment.  The  strategy  was  extended with refne selection for various particular disciplines,  collaborative institutions and collaborative countries. 
4.1 Growth 
Figure 1 shows the yearly publication of BHU. Maximum  (1000) publications are observed in 2013, whereas minimum  (200)  publications  are  seen  in  1995.Figure  also  shows  that  publications were nearly constant for the period 1989 to 2005  except  the  year  1995  where  dip  was  observed.  Exponential  growth is seen since the year 2005. The many vacant seats of  faculty members were flled at that time (2004-05) might be

the reason for exponential growth after 2005. 
Table 1 describes the yearly distribution of three primary  bibliometric  components  viz,  quantity  (P),  quality  (i)  and  consistency (ɳ) with two sub indices h and z-index. Maximum  consistency is seen in the year 1995. The value of h-index is  highest in 2011 while the value of z-index is highest in 2012.  The list with the year 2012, as articles, articles proceedings,  reviews, letter and notes of more recent origin would not have  had enough time to collect a reasonable number of citations. For  this reason, the list has been terminated with the year 2012. A   fve-year citation window is considered to be reasonable from  this point of view. For each year in Table 1, a fve year citation  window is used for calculations of different parameters. table 1. Yearly distribution of values of three primary bibliometric

4.2 Authorship  Pattern 
Authorship pattern of BHU is shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2  it is clear that multi author published maximum papers in most  years.  The  two  author  papers  decreases  with  year,  whereas  mega author papers increases with year. In the present study,3  and 4 author is considered as multi author, whereas if number  of author is more than 4 in a paper then it was considered as  mega author.  
The  value  of  collaboration  coeffcient  (CC)  is  shown  in Fig. 3. For calculating the value of CC author follow the  procedure given by Price and Beaver16  and Garg and Dwivedi 
17.  
Figure 2. distribution of authorship pattern with year. 
Figure 3. Distribution of Collaboration Coeffcient with years. 
The Fig. 3 shows that the value of CC above 0.5 in every year  and it is exponentially increasing. According to Ajiferuke18, CC  tends to zero as single authored papers dominate and higher the  value of CC, higher the probability of multi and mega authored  papers. This implies that papers published by BHU are more  in  collaboration  and  collaboration  pattern  is  continually  increasing with years.  
4.3 International  collaboration 
Table  2  lists  values  of  three  primary  bibliometric  components and the h- and z- indices for BHU collaborating  with  leading  countries.  Table  2  indicates  that  BHU’s  main  collaborator country is USA with 607 publications, followed  by  Germany  with  471  publications.  Maximum  consistency  (0.40)  in  international  collaboration  is  seen  with  Nepal,  whereas minimum consistency (0.10) observed with England.  Here, the maximum value of consistency is very less than 1,  this indicate that none country has consistent collaborator with  BHU. USA has a highest value (60)of h-index. While Israel  has maximum (60.5) value of z-index. Highest quality (impact)  (70.01) observed with Russia. This shows that quality of papers  with collaboration with Russia is best in comparison to other  papers.

4.4 Institutional collaboration 
Values  of  three  primary  bibliometric  components  along  with the h- and z- indices for BHU collaborating with leading  institutes are listed in Table 3. It is clearly seen from Table 3 that  CSIR is the main collaborator of BHU with 443 publications,  
Figure 4. A 2-d  z-h map of leading countries in collaboration  
with BHu. 
followed by DRDO with 280 publications. CNRS of France  has  169  publications  in  collaboration  with  BHU.  CSIR  has  maximum (0.39) consistency, whereas DRDO has minimum  (0.17)  consistency  in  collaboration  with  BHU.  Here,  the  maximum value of consistency is very less than 1, this indicate  that  none  institution  has  consistent  collaborator  with  BHU.  Highest  quality  (impact)  (72.84)  observed  with  Oak  Ridge  National Laboratory, USA.  This shows that quality of papers  with collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA  is best in comparison to other papers written with collaboration  to other institutes.

5.     concLuSIonS 
An attempt of 3-D evaluation on a renowned institution  Banaras Hindu University research output published in scholarly  journal listed by Web of Science database for the period 1989 to  2016 is made. Exponential growth of publications is seen since  the year 2005. Maximum consistency of publications is seen  in the year 1995. The papers published by BHU are more in  collaboration and collaboration pattern is continually increasing  with years. BHU’s main collaborator country is USA with 607  publications,  followed  by  Germany  with  471  publications.  Maximum consistency (0.40) in international collaboration is  seen with Nepal, whereas minimum consistency observed with  England. The maximum value of consistency is very less than  1, this indicate that none country has consistent collaborator  with  BHU.  Highest  quality  (impact)  (70.01)  observed  with  Russia,  which  indicates  quality  of  papers  with  collaboration  with Russia is best in comparison to other papers. CSIR is the  main collaborator of BHU with 443 publications, followed by  DRDO with 280 publications. Chemistry has maximum (2118)  publications,  followed  by  Physics  with  1884  publications.  Highest consistency (0.37) is seen in sub-feld electrochemistry.  Current Science published maximum research publications of  BHU.  Sepectrochimica Acta  Part A  has  highest  consistency  (0.53),  while  Astrophysics  and  Space  Science  has  lowest  (0.19) consistency. Maximum 346 publications are written by  ON Shrivastava of Department of Physics, whereas maximum  citations are received by C.P. Singh of same department.
