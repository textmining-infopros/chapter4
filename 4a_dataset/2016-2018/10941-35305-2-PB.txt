ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this paper is to propose an e-information literacy index that provides realistic values to distinguish  whether university teachers are literate in regard to awareness and use of e-information resources by explaining the  characteristics of e-information literate teacher. The present survey attempts to formulate e-information literacy index  of university teachers by taking into consideration three components viz. awareness of e-resources, availability of  ICT facilities and use of internet services and search techniques to retrieve e-information. The fndings shows that  60.52 per cent teachers are e-information literate. Amongst the teachers, the index for Assistant Professors is highest  followed by Professors and Associate Professors. It indicates that Assistant Professors are more e-information literate  than their superiors. Amongst the universities, the index of Shivaji University, Kolhapur is highest. As far as author’s  consciousness, there are several indices meant for different purposes but in the higher education sector to defne the  characteristics of e-information literate university teacher in terms of an index is unique and special.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Today,  we  leave  in  an  era  surrounded  by  digital  sea  of  information. Owing to the availability of vast array of unfltered  information on a given topic, the process of identifying and  selecting peculiar e-information has become complex. In this  circumstance E-Information literacy directs the users towards  authentic and reliable sources of information available online  useful  for  their  informed  judgements  against  the  quest  for  information. E-Information literacy is the ability to properly  use and evaluate electronic resources, tools and services and  apply it for lifelong learning process. E-information literacy  among  the  university  teachers  contributes  towards  their  learning process and brings in overall change in the way how  they collect and use information.  
The  present  study  intends  to  defne  the  e-information  literacy  rank  amongst  the  university  teachers  in  tech  savvy  environment considering their awareness, use and retrieval of  e-information from e-resources in the form of an index value.  E-information  literacy  index  is  a  statistical  measure  used  to  determine  how  university  teachers  are  making  best  use  of  e-information  for  their  teaching  and  research  purposes.  The  index values were determined against the responses given by  teachers  for  proposed  and  defned  clusters  of  components/ indicators  mentioned  in Appendix A. The  exercise  helped  to  enlist the qualities of e-information literate teachers in the vast

and  changing  digital  sea  of  information.  It  has  been  found  that the formulated index values differ amongst teachers and  the  universities  under  study  depending  upon  their  ability,  performance  in  regard  to  the  use  and  searching  techniques  applied for getting e-information.     
2. LITERATURE  REVIEW  
Hargittai1  recommend for the creation of an index variable  as  proxies  for  web-oriented  digital  literacy  measures  on  Internet use and methodology based on verifying the validity  of the measures derived from their relationship with actual skill  measures. She again revisited her survey measures with new  terms in order to assess the change in digital literacy measures  of the respondents and found discrepancy older Internet terms  and new web-based concepts thus resulting in change in the  index values2. Thornbush3  suggested S-E index that provides  a  broader  classifcation  of  weathering  processes  based  on  visible surface forms in the feld of archaeogeomorphological  research. Katz & others4  conducted a survey to measure the  cumulative, holistic impact of discrete ICT (Information and  Communication  Technologies)  and  a  composite  digitisation.  An index was developed based on six overarching components,  viz.  affordability,  infrastructure  investment,  network  access,  capacity,  usage,  and  human  capital.  The  fndings  showed  that  proper  ICT  infrastructure  and  attention  towards  digital  technology  usage  is  required  for  better  fow  and  awareness  of digital literacy. Alguliyev & Others5  explore an index for

evaluating the quality of research output of researchers with  the 25 indices which shows that the weighted index may serve  as a supplement to h-index and its variants. Sahoo6  propose  the I-index which states that an author’s percentage shares in  the total citations that his/her papers have attracted. The index  is useful to know comprehensive idea of an author’s overall  research performance. 
3.  OBJECTIVES 
The core objectives of the study : 
(i) To  know  the  level  of  awareness  of  e-resources  and  
searching techniques applied by the university teachers in  
retrieving e-information 
(ii) To study the availability of ICT facilities for the use of  
internet services by the university teachers; and (iii) To formulate an e-information literate index of university  
teachers. 
4.  METHODOLOGY 
for the present study, descriptive method of research  has been used. The data was collected through structured  questionnaire  distributed  to  targeted  sample  of  360  university teachers of 43 different departments working in  the 10 state universities of Maharashtra, India in the faculties  of sciences, social sciences and humanities (languages). A total  of 347 teachers responded (96.38 per cent) to the survey. Their  literacy levels were tested based on their self-perceived skills  and skills learnt with the help of others. 
*1 = Literate and 0 = Illiterate 
4.1  Methodology  Used 
Keeping  in  mind  the  search  for  e-information,  access  and retrieval techniques applied by a normal user, a common  strategy  in  terms  of  methodological  (measuring)  indicators  were  suggested  that  defnes  the  qualities  of  e-information  literate user with an index value against suggested cut-off value.  These methodological indicators were applied for the targeted  group of teachers working in the universities under study. The  proposed index is based on analysis of indicators against the  clusters which results in certain startling outcomes.  
The suggested clusters and their indicators may also be  applied  to  other  teachers  working  in  different  disciplines  / universities by changing the clustered framework in regard to  the ICT advancement and its searching techniques. To formulate  an e-information literacy index of university teachers a series  of questions were designed which comprised of 65 indicators  comprising  of  tick  marked  and  fve  point  scale  questions,  which were equally weighted (0.33) Table 1 and grouped in  3  clusters  of  components  viz. Awareness  of  e-resources  (23  indicators); Availability of ICT facilities and Use of Internet  Services (14 indicators) and the search techniques to retrieve  e-information  (28  indicators)  to  measure  the  e-information  literate characteristics of the teachers, enlisted in Appendix A.  The equal weight is calculated as 1/3 = 0.33 to represent the  index value as ‘0’ and ‘1’ receptively. The resulted measures  depend on the aspects related to e-information awareness and  use, ICT facilities and searching skills which help in assessing  their e-information literacy skills. 
The  proposed  measuring  indicators  were  tested  with

responses given by the university teachers. However, before  calculating the index except tick marked questions all the fve  point question response values were converted between 0 and  1 as 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1 in order to show the similarity that  will be useful for calculating an index by proposing a cut-off  value at 0.5.

As a sample, the index of frst teacher was calculated in  the following way: 
A = Sum of response value of frst component   
B = Sum of response value of second component  
C = Sum of response value of third component  
D = A/23,  E= B/14, f= C/28  
G = Index (Average of D, E and f) 
H = The frst teacher suppose to be e-information literate  considering cut-off value at 0.5 value and the index is above  cut-off value.  
Accordingly, an index was calculated for all the teachers  under study (shown in histogram) to represent whether they are  e-information literate or illiterate. 
 It is clear from  fig. 1 and Table 3 the lowest index observed  was 0.0766 and highest was 0.9167. Majority of the teachers  are having e-information literacy index between 0.3 and 0.8.  The index level was highest between the ranges 0.6 and 0.7.  Out of 347 respondents, 23% (79) of university teachers are  having e-information literacy index between 0.6 and 0.7. About

teachers. 
74%  (257)  teachers  are  having  e-information  literacy  index  between 0.4 and 0.8. It has been found that the distribution of  e-information literacy index is not symmetric owing to differing  skill levels of teachers. further, e-information literacy index  has negatively skewed and it shows relatively fat distribution.  210 (60.52%) teachers were found to be e-information literate  and remaining 137 (39.48%) were not e-information literate.  
5.  FINDINGS 
From Tables 4 and 5, we may draw following fndings;  	 It is found that 210 (60.52%) teachers were e-information  
literate based on index value.  
	 when  looked  across  the  disciplines  of  sciences,  social  
sciences and arts and humanities, it is proved that Science  
faculties  (0.5835)  are  more  e-information  literate  than  
Social Science (0.5427) and Arts and Humanities (0.4616)  
faculties. 
	 from  the  gender  based  analysis,  it  was  found  that  the  
index is high in case of female teachers (0.5516) than the  
male teachers (0.5309). 
	 In  addition,  from  the  designation  wise  analysis  it  was  
found  that  index  for  Assistant  Professors  was  highest  
(0.5621) followed by Professors (0.5338) and Associate  
Professors (0.4975).

it  was  observed  that  the  e-information  literate  index  
was  higher  in  case  of  Shivaji  University,  Kolhapur  
(0.6093),  followed  by  Sant  Gadge  Baba  Amravati

University,  Nagpur  (0.4978),  Dr  Babasaheb  Ambedkar  
Marathwada University, Aurangabad (0.4324). 
Thus from the above detailed explanations it is revealed  that depending upon the ICT/self skills of university teachers in  handling e-information, awareness about different e-resources,  tools  and  techniques  for  searching,  accessing  and  retrieving  e-information  either  from  the  internet  or  from  subscribed  e-resources  and  availability  of  suffcient  infrastructure  at  the  universities,  the  e-information  literacy  index  of  teachers  calculated varies from teacher to teacher amongst the faculties  and  universities.  The  awareness  and  use  of web  2.0  along  with  the  internet  services  by  the  university  teachers  was  an  additional verifying criteria used to measure the e-information  literacy level of the teachers in terms of an index value.   
6.  CONCLUSIONS 
The  difference  in  e-information  literacy  index  among  the  institutions  and  groups  may  be  attributed  to  the  efforts  taken by each of the universities in building the required ICT  infrastructure, training teachers in the effective retrieval and use  of e-information and teachers self skills. The poor index value  of  university  teachers  needs  to  be  accounted  with  suffcient  awareness campaigns, ICT facilities and online training about  searching techniques by the universities/ university libraries.  further academic/learning and research tasks of the university  teachers may be strengthened by arranging discipline specifc  user  awareness  programmes  and  also  by  allocating  certain  hours per week in the time-table especially for searching and  seeking e-information from different sources. This also may be  made as part of the continued education programme for faculty  members to become independent learners.
