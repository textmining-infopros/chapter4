Social networking sites are visibly the latest trend and have changed the way the 21st century communicates  each other. Its usage becomes more and more in the world of information, its presence in the library and information  science becomes challenging and exciting. The aim of this study was to know the trend of posting, sharing, commenting  and like a Facebook post, to understand the participation level and response against Facebook group post, and also  to explore the type of content generated by library and information science  community through Facebook Group.  Group postings/contents of four different Facebook group pages (LIS Group, LIS-XPRESS, S.M.I.T. library students,  students of LIS), operating and use by LIS community during February 2012 - February 2015 are collected, read  and analysed. The analysis of those contents found that sharing photos, links and statuses are major types of group  posts in every group and members hardly posting videos and create events for the community.

1.  INtrODUCtION 
Brown1   has  described  social  networking  is  visibly  the  latest  trend  and  has  changed  the  way  the  21st   century  communicates each other. Social networking is a web based  software  which  enabled  people  to  interact  and  collaborate  each  other  online.  Farkas2   has  mentioned  in  his  book,  the  concise  defnition  by  Tom  Coates,  ‘Social  software  can  be  defned as software which supports, extends, or derives added  value from human social behaviour - message boards, music  taste-sharing, photo-sharing, instant messaging, mailing lists,  social networking’. 
Social networking, in general, allows users to join, create  user pages (necessary information with a profle picture), invite  and accept friendship requests from other users of the system  as a social friend. It also allows users to share ideas, thoughts,  user generated contents (texts, fle attachments, photos, videos,  music, links, etc.) with others. It also allows professionals to  exchange information, opportunities, and ideas. Professionals  stay abreast of the recent trends in their profession.  
Suraweera3, et al.have highlighted that mentors and tutors  are continuously trying to expand the classroom discussions  beyond boundaries, by way of posting home works and checks  using social networking sites to support students during their  home  assignments.  These  benefts  not  only  the  students  but  also parents to make queries and clear doubts without personal  appearance.

Social  networking  usage  becomes  more  and  more  in  the  world  of  information,  its  presence  in  the  library  and  information science becomes challenging and exciting. Even  though different studies have aimed at Facebook use and its  impact  on  various  sectors  of  the  society,  but  very  few  have  focused on Facebook usage by library and information science  (LIS)  professionals.  The  recent  study  seeks  to  add  to  the  literature  to  understand  how  LIS  community  uses  Facebook  for  collaborating,  sharing  and  discussing  their  professional  activities through different Facebook groups.  
3.  LItErAtUrE rEVIEW 
3.1 Facebook  Groups  and  Communities  
Online  interpersonal  sites,  for  example,  Friendster,  MySpace, and the Facebook have met an unprecedented growth  since inception. The security and user privacy of these sites  have been raised, despite communicating in a smart way and  striking interaction. The study by Acquisti & Gross4 explored  that  majority  of  its  uses  are  well  known  about  the  security  concern of social sites and are affecting them.  
Clare5, et al. 
   
explored that students joined Facebook pre- registration as a medium of creating new friends at academia,  and can continue to communicate with friends and family at  home. Collaboration through online mode becomes easy with  social media technologies. Learners can team up for project  related  activities  by  using  spreadsheets,  PPT  slides,  and  Google Docs. Faculty members are cashing on the developing  prevalence and occasional blogging by utilising online journals

as  extra  educating/learning  assets.  Baruah6   has  mentioned  that  gathering  and  regrouping  of  individuals,  the  game  plan  of  gatherings,  spreading  of  data,  and  measuring  sentiments  through  online  networking  are  especially  simple,  least  expensive  approaches  to  accomplish  through  social  network  technologies. 
Schroeder & Greenbowe7  have highlighted the Facebook  and other social cooperation devices have the potency to be  used as an examination board or even as a notice board to post  announcement.  Kelley8,  et  al. have  investigated  suggested  control  of  access,  concerns  relating  to  privacy  and  security  decisions and sharing of contents through Facebook. 
An  evaluation  by  Greene9,  et  al. on  the  contents  of  Facebook  groups  dedicated  to  diabetes  revealed  that  forum  like  features  of  Facebook  provides  a  platform  where  people  had diabetes can sharing their experiences, ask questions, and  collect feedback and suggestions. 
Asking questions in online forums and answering services  offer  the  opportunity  to  satisfy  personal  information  needs  directly. Also,  one  may  build  up  knowledge  by  engaging  in  ongoing  conversations  with  peers.  Key  aspects  are  types  of  knowledge user’s aim for and pragmatic intents of questions,  knowledge-related characteristics of posts and also the success.  The  investigation  by  Griesbaum10  found  that  knowledge  creation  predominantly  follows  a  socio-cultural  paradigm  of  knowledge exchange.  
3.2 Facebook  for  Library  and  Information  
Profession  
Villiers11  described Facebook is one of the most favourite  social networking site (SNS), where one meets his/her friends,  write ‘walls’ of each other’s and renew the friendship. It is a  site where one can able to see his/her friend’s latest pictures  and  activities.  To  know  the  use  and  pattern  of  Facebook  in  American  libraries Aharony12   has  found  that  public  libraries  are using its wall and upload photos as the preferred way to  share  information  than  academic  libraries. however,  it  also  found  that  both  types  of  libraries  use  Facebook  for  passing  information to users, rather than use as a discussion forum. The  libraries and information organizations are using social network  sites widely and are a more practical tool to communicate with  library users, and also help the individual libraries to outreach  its  services.  Suraweera3   have  pointed  Facebook,  Myspace,  Orkut, and likes are good examples of some social networking  sites,  which  can  put  to  use  for  this  and  are  more  helpful  to  develop a good relationship with friends. 
Vassilakaki  &  Garoufallou13  have  critically  presented  a  series  of  standard  practices  for  creating  and  managing  a  profle  page  on  Facebook  for  information  professionals.  They identifed 12 different information professional specifc  features (like group posts, wall posts, events, and friends, etc.)    are used and also the way librarian put into use.  
Showcasing  library  facilities  has  dependably  been  a  remarkable  passion  for  libraries.  Through  showcasing  techniques, a library can hope to enhance its ability to perceive  and  picture,  in  this  way  drawing  in  more  clients  to  use  its  materials  and  facilities.  Xia14 has  analysed  group  activities  and performances about the marketing of library facilities in  
96 
Facebook.    
Young LIS professionals fnd it easy to share knowledge  and collaborate with others through Facebook, and its unique  features  help  to  create  groups,  collaboration  dynamically,  publishes,  exchange,  share  and  cooperates  any  information.  Professionals  are  also  using  SNS  for  creating  awareness,  socializing,  making  friends  and  for  topic  discussion  and  metadata  linking.  Parveen15   also  shown  evidence  on  the  use  of  Facebook  by  LIS  professionals  for  not  only  in  sharing  knowledge, experience, views but also to create a network of  professionals for collaborating each other by posting contents  in a virtual community. Facebook proved as the most popular  social  site  and  have  a  great  prospect  for  promoting  health.  Zhang16, et al.  analysed the messages of an active Facebook  diabetes  group  and  found  that  users  can  communicate  with  people of similar conditions in local languages as well. Sharing  personal  experience,  knowledge,  emotions  and  sentiments,  lifestyle  and  medical  information  are  the  major  types  of  contents of Facebook group members. 
3.3 Facebook  for  Collaboration  and  Knowledge  
Sharing  
The concept of ‘collaboration’ and ‘knowledge sharing’  leads  to  the  exchange  of  information  between  more  than  one  people.  The  term  ‘collaboration’  in  academic  settings,  generally the connection with the assignments, discussions or  joint activities of learning and its related works of a student.  And  ‘knowledge  sharing’  mainly  emphasises  on  sharing  of  knowledge between individuals, team, and organisation. Zach  and Agosto17 examined the theoretical base of online learning  techniques for collaboration to teach library and information  science  students.  They  also  presented  framework  model  for  online  course  design  to  maximise  the  beneft  of  online  collaboration and knowledge sharing.  
Gaal18   investigated  the  ways  of  sharing  expertise  and  knowledge for professional development using in-house social  media technologies and also use of other technologies available  in  public  domain  as  well.  Their  study  also  recommended  organizations  should  encourage  employees  for  sharing  their  expertise  and  knowledge  using  social  media  technologies.  Suwannatthachote  and  Tantrarungroj19   have  investigated  the  use  of  Facebook  for  collaborative  work  during  the  group  project  by  adding  team  members,  using  real-time  chat,  and  sending personal messages to contact between members of the  group.   
Baresch20, et al.  has examined that, Facebook users post  the links to external content, such as; written materials with  photo,  link  to  video  social  network  sites,  news  and  general  information and sports/arts/entertainment, etc. To answer the  types  of  knowledge  sharing  and  interaction  pattern  among  the Malaysians, Din & haron21 have revealed that the culture  is Facebook is related to sharing knowledge as a way of life.   Kurtz23   investigated  that  how  the  use  of  two  platforms  –  a  Facebook  group  and  a  course  website  –  affected  student’s  awareness  of  learning  and  participation.  They  found  that  discussion and learning could be possible through Facebook as  a virtual environment.  
Using social media as the wealth of knowledge sharing is

the latest trend nowadays. Suebsom24  has presented the pattern,  attitude,  and  perception  of  students  using  it.  Also  students  using it to discuss and share knowledge in higher education  classroom  and  used  as  a  tool  for  teaching  and  learning.  Villiers11 &  Karnik25, et  al.   in  their  study  examined  the  use  and  gratifcation  of  some  features  of  Facebook.  Participants  revealed data concerning a music activity with four different  enjoyments as; contribution; discovery; social interaction and  entertainment. To test the Facebook as a possible alternate of  a learning management system (LMS), Meishar-Tal, Kurtz, &  Pieterse26 have  attempted  and  used  the  Facebook  group  as  a  course site. The students uttered satisfaction with the learning  content and interaction with Facebook.  To explore the category  and effect of user generated content posted by the user of the  open  access  institutional  repository  (DSpace)  on  Facebook.  Kurian27  has analysed the personal and professional information  posts by the members of DSapce group on Facebook. Contents  posted  by  users  requested,  greetings,  status-up-date,  and  announcements and there has been the signifcant increase in  the posting during the study.   
 The review of the previous study clearly indicated that  none of them examined the content shared through Facebook  group  posting  by  LIS  community.  This  study  focused  on  the  analysis  of  user  generated  content  for  collaboration  and  knowledge sharing through the Facebook group.  
4. AIM AND  ObJECtIVES 
The target of the study is to get how LIS community uses  the Facebook group for collaboration and knowledge sharing  by analysing the posts.  
• To explore the trend of posting by LIS community in the  
Facebook group.  
• To know the trend of sharing, comments and likes by LIS  
community against the group postings.  
• To understand the level participation and response by the  
LIS community in the discussion of issues/queries.  • To explore the type of group posting and content generated  
by LIS community in the Facebook group. 
5. MEtHODOLOGY 
The objective of this study was an analysis of how LIS  professional community uses Facebook? The study emphasis is  on sharing of information from a user (the 1st  person who posts  content) to other users (successive readers, commentators, the  person  who  share  others  post,  etc.).  Analytics  of  Facebook  group and pages was the approach used in this study. Group  postings/contents of four different Facebook Group Pages (LIS  Group, LIS-XPRESS, S.M.I.T. Library Students, Students of  LIS), operating and use by LIS community during the period  February 2012 to February 2015 are collected and analysed. 
6. DAtA  COLLECtION  FOr tHE  StUDY 
All four Facebook Groups are a public group in nature,  information  shared  by  these  groups  can  be  accessed  and  analysed without joining the group. But 1st authors is a member  of all these groups and have been posting contents since many  years related to the professional matter. Different administrators  and moderators manage these community based groups, and  
there are more than 21000 single members have joined since  created. In the frst phase, the Facebook group link has fed into  the  social  media  analytics  tool  called  www.sociograph.io  to  analyse the group postings/contents. Study date has set in the  tool for extracting analysis data from the tool. The content of  group posting are classifed as follows: 
Content types 
Details of content on Facebook 
Photos 
Videos 
Links 
Status 
Pictures, images and photos related to profession  or interest of group members. 
Videos and play related to LIS profession. It may  be direct video or an external link to video sites. Any  link  that  contains  LIS  profession  related  matters. 
Its  is  a  short  message  that  depicts  the  current  situation of the group. “Status” are the small posts  by the users of Facebook to present their situations  and feelings as said by hum27, et al. 
Events 
Invitation to occasions and happenings related to  LIS profession with date, time and venue of the  particular event. 
In the second phase, of the study the report was generated  and  extracted  to  Excel  fle  using  ‘Export  in  XLS’  option  available in the tool. Later the exported data was arranged as  per the objective of the study and data were analysed using  Microsoft Excel. 
7.    r ESULtS AND ANALYSIS 
7.1 Facebook  Groups  Created  by  LIS  Community 
The analysis based on Table 1 presents the fnding with  a tabular representation of demographic data. The Facebook  groups under study were created almost in the year 2011 except  S.M.I.T. Library Students have created in the year 2012. LIS  Group is more popular among all with 12,094 no of individual  members  have  joined  the  group,  where  as  S.M.I.T.  Library  Students group stands 4th regarding no of members have joined.  LIS-Xpress tops with 3533 total posts and 2.18 posting per day  on an average. Again S.M.I.T. Library Student’s group is less  active than others. 
7.2   t rend  of  Posting  by  LIS  Community  in  
Facebook  Groups 
The analysis in Fig. 1 clearly shows that LIS professionals  are very much active and using group posts (6518 total posts)  for  discussing  professional  matters  through  Facebook.  The  fgure also indicates that members of LIS-Xpress group have  participated  in  discussion  with  highest  posting  (1230  in  the  year 2012) in every year as compared to other groups, whereas  posting through S.M.I.T. Library Student’s group are less (8 in  the year 2013).

Posting  from Students of LIS received the highest number of comments  (with 1500) per post. At the same time, SMIT Library Student’s  group received the lowest number of response for its posting. 
Figure 1. trend of group posting in Facebook 
Table 2  explains that professional are more interested in  like against group post rather than sharing. Members of this  group are reasonably posting comment against group posts. It  also indicates that the sharing, commenting and liking a post  are  increasing  day  by  day.  Table  2   describes  that  members  of this group are like more against a group post. Same time  members  are  moderately  give  comments  and  sharing  for  further reading. 
Table 2  presents the members of this group are not much  active to comment & like the group post. The chart also show  that  from  2013  number  of  like  against  group  post  slowly  increased.  Table  2   tells  that  upto  2014  comment  &  sharing  of group post was similar pace, after that members are more  interested in comment than share.

posts  in  every  group.  Surprisingly  all  four  groups  have  not  posted much content related to videos and events, which are  just above 1per cent of the total content in both cases.  
In terms of sharing photos (including pictures and images)  were represented 19.42 per cent of the total content by Students  of LIS and is highest among the studied groups. In the case  of posting links were represented 55.91 per cent of the total  content by SMIT Library Students and is the highest among  all groups. while in the case of posting status (short message  that depicts the current situation of the group) were represented  57.86 per cent of the total content by students of LIS and is  the highest among all groups. Table 4 shows that, among all  categories  of  content,  links  and  statuses  are  represented  the  most leading form of posting with 55.91 per cent (by SMIT  Library Student) and 57.86 per cent (by Students of LIS).

8. CONCLUSIONS 
The aim of this study was to know the trend of posting,  sharing, commenting and like a Facebook post, to understand  the  participation  level  and  response  against  Facebook  group  post,  and  also  to  explore  the  type  of  content  generated  by  LIS  community  through  Facebook  Group.  Four  Facebook  groups  (i.e.  LIS  Group,  LIS-XPRESS,  S.M.I.T.  Library  Students, Students of LIS) are all created and use by Library  and  Information  Science  (LIS)  professionals  are  considered  for      this  study.  This  study  showed  that  LIS  professionals  are  active  on  Facebook  group  for  sharing  their  knowledge  and  collaborating  with  others.  LIS  professionals  are  very  much  interested  in  collaboration  through  Facebook  group,  and sharing knowledge through Facebook posting, as per the  Table 2 number of comment and like against group posts are  much higher than sharing those posts. As per the data on Table  1, the number of members in a particular group affects the rate  of posting content through Facebook.  
Kurian28   described  that  Facebook  be  likely  to  fulfll  the need of users for information, medium for develop good  relationship and sharing of knowledge. This study was found  that LIS professionals engaging in sharing, commenting and  liking  group  post,  which  clearly  shows  that  they  are  using  Facebook  group  for  sharing  and  discussing  professional  problems and topics. This study also observed various types of  content generated by Facebook group members. Those posts  were based on the default options available for posting content  in  Facebook  group  like;  photos,  videos,  links,  statuses,  and  events. The analysis of those contents and found that sharing  photos, links and statuses are major types of group posts in  every  group  and  members  hardly  posting  videos  and  create  events for the community. 
The  current  study  based  on  the  four  LIS  community  based  groups  of  Facebook,  in  future  a  related  study  on  the  other groups/community will be required to know the member  generated content at micro level. Moreover the study may be  extended  to  examine  the  level  of  communication  pattern  in  order to know the role played by social networking sites as an  effective and fruitful medium of collaboration and knowledge  sharing.
