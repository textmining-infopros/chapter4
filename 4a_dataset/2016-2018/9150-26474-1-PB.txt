The  paper  highlights  on  virtual  reference  service  (VRS)  in  academic  libraries.  It  is  a  new  face  of  reference  which  is  known  as  virtual  reference  rendering  through  online  that  enables  library  patrons  to  ask  reference  questions  through  a  library’s  website.  It  gives  greater  opportunities  to  user,  who  can  access  services  at  home,  in  offce,  at  school,  or  in  a  library.  Investigative  survey  method  has  been  applied  into  the  state  of  VRS  in  the  libraries  of  IIT’s  in  India.  The  study  reveals  that  a  remarkable  advancement  in  the  electronic  access  to  information  has  been  achieved  in  these  libraries.

1.  INTRODUcTION 
Libraries and Information services have long been  engaged in providing reference services to their users.  Internet and digital libraries have changed significantly  the nature of reference services. A number of digital  reference  services  (DRS)  are  now  available  from  library and non-library organisations1.  DRS  can  be  divided according to the type of technology used2,  because  of  its  ease  of  use  and  universality. 
In the fast changing technological era, with the  advent  of  internet  as  powerful  medium  to  provide  the  information  round  the  clock,  i.e.,  24*7.  The  internet  with  its  services  like  e-mail,  www,  bulletin  board services have changed the notion of traditional  library into virtual library and the traditional services  are  now  called  information  services3   to  meet  the  quick demand of the user, librarians maintain virtual  collection and also access e-resources and provide  information in virtual mode. With the emergence of  virtual library and influence of internet, the concept  of traditional reference service has transformed into  Virtual  Reference  Service  (VRS). 
  It  has  been  observed  that  many  large  and  modern  libraries  in  India  as  well  as  outside  India  have  a  general  reference  desk,  full  time  reference  librarians  with  subject  specialists  and  off  desk  responsibilities4. This  type  of  an  environment  need  to  be  cultivated  in  academic  libraries,  especially  in  Indian  Institutes  of  Technology  (IIT  libraries)  where  the  thrust  is  on  imparting  education  and  
pursuing  research  and  consultancy.  Thus,  with  the  advancement  of  changing  technology,  the  mode  of  providing  reference  service  in  the  academic  libraries  is  gradually  changing.  It  is  now  presented  to the user in a new and more developed form that  is  ‘Virtual  Reference  Service’,  which  is  otherwise  known  as  ‘Digital  Reference  Service’.  
1.1  Virtual  Reference  Service  (VRS) 
The  VRS  is  also  an  internet  based  reference  service  where  a  user  can  ask  a  question  online  where  the  user  and  the  librarian  communicate  in  real  time5.  It  uses  computers  and  communication  technology  to  provide  reference  service  to  users  anytime  and  anywhere. 
The  VRS  is  defined  as  the  provision  of  real- time personal assistance to patrons via web- based  interactive software. To meet the user at his or her  ‘point of need’ and to satisfy the patron’s information  need,  the  librarian  can  use  a  ‘Chat’  component  of  the  software  to  answer  a  fairly  specific  or  simple  question,  possibly  deliver  slideshows,  ‘push’  web  sources to the patron, and provide online bibliographic  instruction6.  The  ‘point  of  need’  may  happen  when  the  library  is  closed,  or  when  the  user  is  unable  to  get  to  the  library. This  way,  users  can  still  be  in  contact  with  experienced  reference  librarians. 
1.2   benefits  of  VRS 
Admittedly,  the  lack  of  time  and  physical  cues  can  be  considered  drawbacks  of  virtual  reference.

However,  it  does  provide  benefits  that  other  forms  of  reference  lack: 
• Reaches  users  in  and  out  of  libraries/social  
inclusion; 
• Invites  new  users  into  the  library; 
• Provides  better  remote  service  for  users-real  
information  need; 
• Adds online learning component-can walk users  
• • •

1.4.2  Synchronous  Transactions 
The  synchronous  transaction,  on  the  other  hand  takes  place  in  ‘real  time’  with  an  immediate  response to the query9, The examples of synchronous  
through  finding  the  information  themselves,  as  transaction  are: 
• 
• •

Supports real-time immediate assistance, immediate  gratification; 
Extend  library  service  hours;

in  advance;  and 
Takes  the  library  to  the  users.  
1.3  Elements  of  VRS 
VRS  incorporates  the  following  basic  elements: 
(a) The  user 
(b) The  interface  (web  form;  e-mail;  chat;  video,  
etc.) 
(d) Electronic resources (including electronic or CD  
–based resources; web resources; local digitised  
material,  etc.)  as  well  as  print  resources (e) The  information  professional 
1.4  Modes  of  VRS 
The  VRS  models  can  be  broadly  divided  in  to  three categories. The Figure 1 exhibits the various  types  of  VRS  currently  in  practice7. 
Figure 1. Modes of virtual reference service. 1.4.1   Asynchronous  Transaction 
The  Asynchronous  transaction  involves  a  time  delay between the question and answer8. Following  are  the  examples  of  asynchronous  transaction: • E-mail  based, 
• Web-form  or Ask  a  service, 
Many libraries and organisations have recognised  the benefits of providing DRS through collaborative  services. Some regional library consortia are offering  member libraries the opportunity to share reference  questions  with  each  other  using  the  internet  and  other technologies. The collaborative Digital Reference  Service (CDRS)10, operated by the library of congress,  is  an  international  network  of  libraries,  consortia,  museums,  Ask  a  services  that  uses  a  help  desk  system to route questions to appropriate institutions  based  on  member  profile. 
2.  ObJEcTIVES 
The  objectives  of  the  present  study  are  to:  (a) Uncover the present status of VRS being provided  
in  IIT  libraries;  and 
(b) Conduct  users  study  of  VRS  provided  by  IIT  
libraries  in  India. 
3.  METHODOLOGY

for  the  users  study.  
4.1  Purpose  of Access  of  Internet 
An attempt has been made to know the purpose  for the access of internet by the users. Table 1 reveals  that maximum number of the users  86.04 % accessing  internet  for  education  purpose  includes  academic  activities, career development, and limited high-quality  self  discovery  activities.  80.81  %  users  accessing  internet  for  communication  includes  e-mail,  voice  mail,  texting,  instant  messaging.  
4.2  Opinion  regarding  use  of computer  
Literacy 
Table  2  represents  that  41.86  %  users  agree  about  computer  literacy  implies  that  their  ability  to  retrieve  e-resources  from  the  computers  and  put  to  effective  use  is  reduced.  71  (41.27  %)  users   strongly agree that computer literacy is important in  the usage of electronic resources/ services because  electronic  resources  are  increasingly  available  on  the  internet  or  websites  of  the  particular  institutes  thereby  making  it  possible  for  students  to  access  and  use  current  and  relevant  literature  for  studies  and research. 22 (12.79 %) users somewhat agree  for  computer  literacy  is  importance  in  the  usage  of  electronic  resources/  services  and  there  are  7  (4.06  %)  users  who  disagree  for  the  same. 
4.3 Awareness  of  Library  Website 
A  library  website:  provide  a  compelling  user  experience, effectively publish and provide access to  content, promote library online and offline services  and  increase  community  engagement.  Table  3  found  that  133  (77.32  %)  users  are  aware  for  their  institutional  library  websites  because  website  provides  ready  access  library  news,  information,

4.4 Awareness  about  Library  Offering  VRS 
Table  4  represents  that,  137  (79.65  %)  users  are  aware  about  their  institutions  library  offering  VRS  and  only  35  (20.34  %)  users  are  not  aware  about  the  institutions  library  offering  VRS. 
4.5  Usability  of  VRS 
Table 5 shows that, VRS is easy to use because,  44.52  %  was  observed  that  is  highest  for  all  other  options.  44  (32.11  %)  users  rate  that  very  easy  usability  of  the  VRS,  23  (16.78  %)  users  rate  that  somewhat  easy  usability  of  the  VRS,  8  (5.83  %)  users  rate  that  difficult  usability  of  VRS,  1(0.72  %)  users  rate  that  very  difficult  to  VRS. 
4.6  Sufficiency  of  Information  Literacy  
Programme  
Information  Literacy  Program’s  mission  is  to  provide  opportunities  for  introducing  users  to  the  facilities,  organisation,  resources,  and  services  of  the library. The primary mission to ensure students  develops  information  literacy  skills,  attitudes,  and  knowledge  to  become  efficient  and  effective  users  and  producers  of  information.  Table  6  shows  that  most  of  the  users  agree  that  library  offer  sufficient  information literacy programme, 36 (26.27 %) users  somewhat agree that library offer sufficient information  literacy skills programme, 33 (24.08 %) users strongly  agree and 20 (14.59 %) users disagree that library  offer  sufficient  information  literacy  programme.

5.  FINDINGS 
It is observed from the study, that  86.04 % users  are  accessing  internet  for  their  education  purpose  includes  academic  activities,  career  development,  and  limited  high-quality  self  discovery  activities.  Following  observations  have  been  found: 
• Most of the library users agreed that computer  
literacy is importance whenever using e-resources,  
about  their  institutions  library  websites,  as  
well  as,  about  their  institutions  library  offering  
VRS. 
• Most  of  the  IIT  libraries’  users  rated  that  it  is  
easy  to  use  of  the  VRS. 
• 48  (35.05  %)  user  ‘agreed’  and  36  (26.27  %)  
‘somewhat  agree’  that  library  offer  sufficient  
information  literacy  skills  programme. 
• 52  (37.95  %)  users  satisfied  and  40  (29.19  %)  
users  very  satisfied  with  VRS  provided  by  the  
library, 33 (24.08 %) users ‘somewhat satisfied’  
and  12  (8.75  %)  were   unsatisfied. 
6.  cONcLUSIONS 
Reference service initiated electronically often in  real-time, where patrons employ computers or other  internet  technology  to  communicate  with  reference  staff,  without  being  physically  present.  VRS  are  increasingly  incorporating  instruction  because  of  the  growing  need  to  teach  patrons  how  to  use  the  exploding  electronic  resources  in  libraries.  Virtual  reference  is  here  to  stay. As  new  technologies  are
