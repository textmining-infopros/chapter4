Information communication technology playing a major role in transmitting idea, thought and information  between one to another. Social networking websites are a good example of communication network and it is a  social structure that lets the user interact and work collaboratively with other users. WhatsApp is a free instant  messenger application that allows users to send text messages and multimedia fles. In this paper, an online survey  was conducted to measure usability of WhatsApp for service delivery in the libraries and information centres. A  random sample was selected from social networking sites from all over India and an online questionnaire was used  to gather information from respondents. Findings indicated that respondents showed a positive attitude toward getting  services over WhatsApp. Most of the respondents believe that use of WhatsApp can improve alert services (CAS,  virtual reference, notifcations) and libraries can utilise their potential for providing better user services.

1. IntroductIon 
Social  media  has  emerged  as  a  great  source  for  information and it provides a platform for interaction among  person  from  different  cultural  settings1.  An  overwhelming  majority of person are engaged in mobile instant messaging  (or MIM) and text messaging in order to maintain connections  and  relationships  with  colleagues,  family,  and  friends2,3,4.  The growing popularity of social media tools has motivated  researchers to explore the roles such media play in everyday  life and in the society. Mobile instant messaging application is   one of the tool of social media. They made person connected in  real time and most of the person spend a lot of time using these  applications. There are many MIM available in the market, such  as WhatsApp, Line, Hike, Nimbuzz, WeChat, iMessage, Viber,  Skype, Facebook Messenger and Telegram. These applications  are free to use and they offer various capabilities for sharing  media: text messages, images, audio clips, videos, documents,  contacts and even location data. The changing trends of society  forced libraries to adjust their operations and services to suit  their users and society. 
2. LIterature revIew 
The library as an organization is a collection of information  resources with the specifc purpose of obtaining, processing,  preserving and making available for the society. The effciency  and effectiveness of the library as a tool of research and learning  is determined by the success of providing relevant and timely  information to their users. Previously, libraries measured their  successes based on completeness and balance of the collection.

 assert that for  optimal use of information, it must have the following qualities:  relevance, accuracy, timeliness, currency, completeness, clarity  and cost effectiveness. 
Traditional library processes and structures are unable to  respond quickly enough in this technology driven environment.  However,  change  is  mandatory  as  technology  has  much  potential that cannot be ignored in modern society. The users of  libraries are also changed and they are depended on technology  such  as  cell  phones,  computers,  and  access  to  the  Internet,  etc. With the impact of technologies and other environmental  changes, the role and concept of library services are changing  very fast. The range of services that can be delivered by the  library is expanding due to the new technology, and it is likely  to expand further. Additionally, the scope of some services has  become nearly unlimited. Some forms of service can be offered  almost as easily around the globe as around the town. Libraries  serve  and  will  serve  far  beyond  their  walls.  All  business  activities may be seen through marketing lenses. Marketing in  case of libraries is necessary to offer benefts to users want,  reduce  barriers  to  use  and  access,  persuade  and  inform  the  users, and carefully plan to satisfy users’ needs effectively. 
Instant  messaging  provides  real-time  communication  between two or more individuals in virtual locations via the  Internet. Analysts have estimated that 2.5 billion IM accounts  are currently active, roughly 47 billion IMessages are exchanged  each  day  world-wide,  and  10  trillion  IMs  are  delivered  annually7,8. Furthermore, researchers estimate that cell phone  IMessangers will increase to 1.3 billion by 20169. Given that  91 per cent of individuals own cell phones and 81 per cent are

using their cell phones to engage in text and IMessaging10, it  is not surprising that IMessaging is becoming more effective  in  person’s  life.  Instant  messages  are  also  preferred  over  telephones  when  more  than  two  person  are  involved  in  the  communication, or when one of the communicators is unable  to maintain privacy given the presence of others who may hear  the communication11. 
3.   w hatSapp 
WhatsApp application was developed in 2009 by Brian  Acton  and  Jan  Koum.  It  is  a  proprietary  cross-platform,  encrypted, instant messaging application for smart phones.  It  uses the Internet to send text messages, images, audio messages,  videos, documents, user location, contacts and to other users  using a mobile number. It runs over various operating systems  like,  iOS, Android, Windows  OS,  Mac  OS,  BlackBerry  OS,  Nokia Series 40, Symbian and Tizen. WhatsApp is also available  for PCs through a web client, under the name WhatsApp Web  in January 2015. It works through web client, which means the  web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your  mobile device—this means all of your messages still live on  your phone and user handset must be connected to the Internet  for the browser application to function. WhatsApp Web user  interface is based on the default Android one11. WhatsApp had  one  billion  users  in  February  2016  which  made  it  the  most  popular messaging application12. 
4.   b enefItS   of  u SIng whatSapp  for  
ServIce  deLIvery 
WhatsApp has its own advantages for service delivering  in libraries and information centres. Some of the benefts are  as follows: 
• WhatsApp  will  facilitate  collaborations  and  promote  
effective communication between library staff and their  
patrons 
• Financially the costs of WhatsApp perceived to be low  
and requires little training 
• It helps gather feedback to enhance user services • It promotes library services and disseminates news quickly  
and delivers the information in real time to the users • It  increases  the  engagement  and  interactions  among  
library staff and their users 
• The promotion of library holdings via WhatsApp can help  
increase usage of the content and maximum utilisation of  
documents 
• It  can  be  used  for  outreach  activities  through  resource  
sharing. A user can able to ask for their required document  
from other libraries in real time environment.  
5.   c haLLengeS   of  u SIng whatSapp 
There are some challenges are also associated with using  WhatsApp in libraries. Some challenges are as follows: • WhatsApp  require  considerable  time  commitment  from  
library staff 
• It  also  requires  technological  expertise,  for  using  the  
WhatsApp web client system to deliver services • The levels of interest and skills for service provided by  
WhatsApp vary across library staff 
• 
• 
• 
• 
There are limited funds available in libraries, to support  more  advanced  social  media  tools  and  the  training  that  would be required to enable this 
A library needs to work hard to maintain engagement of  staff with their users. It is also very diffcult to maintain  popularity by delivering satisfactory services 
It can be diffcult to maintain library branding for resources  made accessible via WhatsApp 
External factors such as Internet connectivity, hardware  issues,  lack  of  training  and  technological  infrastructure  may restrict access. 
6. Scope and  objectIveS 
The study is focused over use of WhatsApp in the different  kind of libraries worldwide but the data collection is limited to  persons from India only. The persons participate in the survey  were  broadly  divided  into  four  categories  students,  research  scholars, working professionals (including librarian and library  staff), library interns (new graduates in library and information  science). There was no participation of faculty members in the  survey. 
By examining benefts and challenges of using WhatsApp,  we expect libraries to use WhatsApp to deliver services over  it. A descriptive research design was used in implementing a  web-based survey to address the following objectives: • To examine the application of WhatsApp in libraries  • To  describe  librarians’  and  users’  perceptions  of  the  
usefulness  of  WhatsApp  for  information/knowledge  
sharing and enhancement of library services 
• To  analyse  users’  attitude  toward  getting  services  over  
WhatsApp 
• To examine factors that might infuence libraries’ decisions  
on using WhatsApp. 
7.  MethodoLogy 
A  structured  online  questionnaire  was  prepared  over  Google  forms  platform  and  distributed.  The  sample  for  the  study  was  taken  from  social  networking  sites  and  random  sampling method was applied to select persons across the India.  The sample size comprises 150 persons and questionnaire was  sent by e-mail to the respondent. We received 134 responses  and  the  response  rate  was  89.33  percent.

Libraries  can  use  WhatsApp  for  delivering  library  services.  There  are  some  suggestions  for  libraries  for  delivering services over WhatsApp; 
(i) New additions, timings, holidays, announcements/notices  
of library 
(ii) Share images/videos about library sections, events, library  
staff, etc 
(iii) Notifcation  about  membership  and  services  of  the  
library 
(iv) Notifcation  about  book  discussions,  reviews,  new  
publications, new acquisition 
(v) Information about new developments in the library (vi) Share information about institution’s publications, reports  
etc 
(vii) Creation of user groups, belong to the same subject and  
ask them about the required documents. 
10.   c oncLuSIonS 
Information  technology  has  changed  the  nature  of  library  services.  In  the  present  age  of  information,  the  use  of  internet  based  tool  is  increasing  rapidly.  The  future  of  the  internet  depends  upon  the  mobile  technologies.  It  is  the  golden opportunity for the libraries to implement mobile based  services  for  their  users.  There  are  many  mobile  based  tools  and  techniques  through  which  libraries  can  provide  services  to their users. 
WhatsApp is an MIM application which can be used in  libraries for delivering various services. It has many features  
364 
like, multimedia sharing, instant message delivery, real-time  audio recording conversation and group messaging. Libraries  can deliver various library services over WhatsApp for better  service  satisfaction.  In  this  study,  users  showed  a  positive  attitude toward getting library services over WhatsApp.
