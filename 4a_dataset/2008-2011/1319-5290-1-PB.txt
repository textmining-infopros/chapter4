ABSTRACT
The advancement in information and communication technology (ICT) has outpaced our abilities to analyse,
summarise, and extract knowledge from the data. Today, database technology has provided us with the basic
tools for the efficient storage and lookup of large data sets, but the issue of how to help human beings to
understand and analyse large bodies of data remains a difficult and unsolved problem. So, intelligent tools
for automated data mining and knowledge discovery are needed to deal with enormous data. As library and
information centres are considered the backbone of knowledge organisation, knowledge discovery in databases
(KDD) is also getting attention of library and information scientists. This paper highlights the basics of KDD
process and its importance in digital libraries.
Keywords: Databases, digital libraries, knowledge, knowledge discovery process, data mining

1. INTRODUCTION

correlations, patterns, and trends by digging into large
amount of data stored in warehouses.

Knowledge has been defined in a number of ways and
there are a number of perspectives on its nature. There
are different types of knowledge, each requiring a different
management approach1. Traditionally, knowledge was
justified true belief2, but now, it is the information with
direction, which enables action and decisions3.
Kafantaris4, gave the meaning of knowledge in relation to
data and information as  data is a set of discrete
objectives or facts of events but would not be instructing
organisations what to do. Data when analysed,
synthesised, and summarised can become information,
which when compared in different situations such as
connections, consequences of daily life, social
interactions and thoughts and views, can become
knowledge.

Knowledge discovery (KD) is a relatively new field
where techniques borrowed from algorithms, artificial
intelligence, mathematics and statistics are combined to
predict and explain new knowledge hidden in volumes of
raw data usually stored in databases6. Data mining is also
taken as synonymous of knowledge discovery in
databases (KDD7), but data mining is one of the parts of
process of knowledge discovery in databases that
requires intelligent technologies and the willingness to
explore the possibility of hidden knowledge that resides in
the data. A generally accepted definition of KDD is given
by Fayyad8, et al. as the non-trivial process of
identifying valid, novel, potentially useful and ultimately
understandable patterns in data.

Earlier the knowledge were written and stored in
books, but now in electronic era, it resolves in databases.
Various tools, methodologies, and techniques to support
knowledge discovery in many fields have been
introduced5. Data mining came as the process of
sampling, exploring, modifying, and assessing large
amounts of data to uncover the unknown patterns. It is the
extraction or mining of knowledge from large amount of
data. Data mining is the science of finding new interesting
patterns and relationship in huge amount of data. It is
defined as the process of discovering meaningful new

The KDD is the process of automatically searching
large volume of data for patterns that can be considered
knowledge about the data. This is described as deriving
knowledge from the input data, which is the non-trivial
extraction of implicit, unknown, and potentially useful
information from the data. However, the knowledge
discovery process is embedded in and constrained by the
organisations institutional context, which impacts the
interpretation of novel information. The important KDD
goal is to turn data into knowledge. For example,
knowledge acquired through such methods on a medical

Knowledge acquired from analysing a financial or
marketing database could revise business practice and
influence a management schools curriculum. Likewise, it
has also attracted the attention of library and information
science professionals for getting information from large
databases for the use of its customers, i.e., the users.

2. PROCESS OF KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
IN DATABASES
A data warehouse is an ideal means for storing data,
which are to be processed by a KDD system. The KDD is
a way, to discover interesting and potentially useful
patterns or rules in data and the core process of KDD is
data mining. However, KDD is not restricted just to data
mining, rather it includes data verification and
preprocessing, selection of appropriate data mining
techniques, verification, and exploitation of their results. A
data mining process involves multiple stages, KDD
involves the activities leading to actual data analysis and
evaluation and deployment of the results. A KDD process
thus includes data warehousing, target data selection,
cleaning, preprocessing, transformation and reduction,
data mining, model selection (or combination), evaluation
and interpretation, and finally consolidation and use of the
extracted knowledge9.
The KDD can be likened to the process of searching
knowledge units from the databases, where huge volumes
of data, particularly the documents, are available without
any intended usage. The KDD process consists in
processing a huge volume of data in order to extract
knowledge units that are non trivial, potentially useful,
significant, and reusable. The KDD process is iterative
and interactive, and controlled by an expert of the data
domain, called the analyst, who is in-charge of guiding the
extraction process, on the base of his objectives, and of
his domain knowledge. The analyst selects and interprets
a subset of the units for building models that are further
considered as knowledge units with a certain plausibility.
Generally, the KDD process is aimed at extracting
from large databases information units that can be
interpreted as knowledge units to be reused and it is
based on three major steps: (i) the data sources are
prepared to be processed, (ii) then they are mined, and
(iii) finally, the extracted information units are interpreted
for becoming knowledge units. These units are in turn
embedded within a representation formalism to be used
within a knowledge-based system. Hitherto, data mining
tools mostly adopt techniques from statistics10, neural
networks11, and visualisation12 to classify data and extract
patterns13. But ultimately, KDD aims to enable an
information system that transforms the information to
knowledge through hypothesis testing and theory
formation. It sets new challenges for database
technologynew concepts and methods are needed for
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)

basic operations, query languages, and query processing
strategies14.
Knowledge discovery is an interactive and iterative
process, which according to Soundararajan15, et al,
involves the following steps:


Learning the Application Domain: Includes relevant
prior knowledge and goals of the application.



Target Data Set: Selecting a data set or data samples
on which discovery is to be performed.



Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removing noise,
deciding on strategies for handling missing data
fields, accounting for time sequence information and
known changes and mapping missing and unknown
values.



Data Reduction and Projection: Includes finding
useful features to represent the data and using
methods to reduce the effective number of variables
under consideration.



Choosing the Functions of Data Mining: Selecting the
data mining function based on data model such as
summarisation, classification, regression, and
clustering.



Choosing the Data Mining Algorithms: Includes
selecting the methods to be used to search for
patterns in the data such as statistical algorithms,
visualisation techniques, deviation trend analysis
decision tree analysis etc. Here, two or more
techniques can be combined depending upon the data
models.



Data Mining: Concerned with applying computational
techniques to find patterns in data in a particular
representational form or set of such representations.
A Pattern that is interesting and certain enough can
be treated as knowledge.



Interpretation: Includes interpreting the discovered
patterns and possibly returning to any of the previous
steps as well as possible visualisation of the
extracted patterns, removing redundant or irrelevant
patterns and translating the useful ones into terms
understandable by the users.



Using the Discovered Knowledge: Includes
incorporating discovered knowledge into the
performance system, taking action based on the
knowledge or simply documenting it for management
and for later use.

The KDD process can be illustrated through the
following diagram (based and modified after
Soundararajan15, et al.) as shown in Fig. 1. So, KDD
process is based on three major steps, data preparation,
data mining, and interpretation of the extracted units. This

process aims on processing a huge volume of data to

expert of the domain of data or by a knowledge-based
system for problem-solving in the domain of data.

3. KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATABASES
IN MEETING USERS DEMANDS
Knowledge discovery refers to the overall process of
discovering useful knowledge from data, and data mining
refers to a particular step in this process. Data mining
involves a collection of tools and techniques for finding
useful patterns relating the fields of very large databases.
The newest form of data mining is the linguistic
summarisation of data which aims at a computergenerated verbal description of the knowledge implicit in a
database often in the form of if then rules that resemble
fuzzy knowledge granules. Text mining is to extract
patterns from textual documents. A text mining technique
typically involves text parsing and analysis to transform
each unstructured document into an appropriate set of
features and subsequently applies one or more data
mining techniques for extracting patterns. Finally,
patterns are interpreted for getting knowledge through
KDD process.
Several KDD packages offer means to visualise
representations16, but none have shown that users prefer
such visualisation tools over textual representations.
Furthermore, it is not clear whether 3D visualisations of
learned models provide benefits over 2D visualisations17.
Now various commercial software are also available which
offer general purpose KDD tools. But there are some
problems in meeting out user demands that may be due
to some technical drawbacks in databases.
The first point relevant to KDD are that data
repositories which tend to be very large. In practice,
knowledge integration will begin to span not only
disparate data models in a single archive, but disparate
archives in disparate database management systems.
The second point is the extremely short phase of data,
448

which are collected cyclically. Data discovery must
accommodate collection cycles that may be unknown 
as for example identifying the cycles of shifts in major
geological faults, or that may shift from cycle to cycle in
both time and space. Instead, knowledge discovery
researchers can turn attention to problems of reasoning
and modeling on very short temporal cycles.
Infrastructure issues that need to be included, for
example  the development of real-time data mining, and
to utilise knowledge discovery tools to guide correlation of
discovered data patterns across time, determination of
temporal drift, validation of data trends across temporal
discontinuities, and so forth. And a third point of relevance
to KDD applies to a characteristic of the data foundation
rather than of the data. The emergence of the internet has
supported development of data clearing houses, digital
libraries, and online repositories wherein one does not
access data, but points to data.
It is paradoxical that as increasing amounts of digital
data become available via the internet, it becomes
increasingly difficult to locate, retrieve, and analyse. This
is due to the fact that the internet lacks a comprehensive
catalogue or index18. Without a coordinating
infrastructure, many data sources and services available
today remain essentially inaccessible. Currently, over
three million websites are online19, and yet even the best
search engines can locate only one third of the
accessible pages. Hence data mining tools need to be
established to locate environmental data sources in the
gray literature areas of the internet.
Such data sources include but are not limited to field
data collected in developing countries, much localised
community data sites such as inner city neighborhood
and community activist sites, and similar data sources
not known to or known by conventional doorways into the
geospatial data infrastructure. This type of knowledge
discovery treats the entire internet as a very large,
decentralised data repository, and provides a venue for
contributions to a global information infrastructure.

4. KNOWLEDGE
LIBRARIES

DISCOVERY

IN

DIGITAL

There have been seen various additions to the
services in traditional libraries in the recent past,
especially in the first decade of 21st century. The addition
to the traditional library services meant that librarians and
users had to acquire additional knowledge and skills to
use computers and find the relevant information. This is
very important, because since then, the pace of change of
information technology and its implementation in libraries
has become faster and the request for new and advanced
competencies of librarians and users have put in focus
many times. These basic knowledge requirements put
certain amount of unwanted pressure on users and of
course, on the librarians. Knowledge management is a
systematic process of acquiring, organising, sustaining,
applying, sharing, and renewing both tacit and explicit
knowledge to enhance the organisational performance,
increase organisational adaptability, increase values of
existing products and services and/or create new
knowledge intensive products, processes and
services20-23. As the digital libraries become more
knowledge-conscious, knowledge discovery and data
mining have become essential for knowledge
management. The information management system
should have data mining capabilities for helping the
knowledge discovery process, and subsequently, to
evolve as a knowledge management system from the
existing information. Knowledge is then organised by
indexing knowledge elements, filtering based on content,
and establishing linkages and relationships among the
elements. Subsequently, this knowledge is made
available to users for supporting their decision-making
process. Keeling and Hornby24, notes that the information
age is linked with life-long learning and technological
skills of librarians needs to be updated. Librarians live in a
competitive environment, and they are advised to stay
focused and relevant while applying knowledge
management principles together with information
technology and communication tools in the libraries to
facilitate the rapidly changing environment.
Digital libraries have a much greater capacity for
knowledge management. Their current architecture
should include classification and thesaurusthe
vocabulary control and knowledge-organising tools, which
serves three purposes in a traditional library-the
description, organisation, and retrieval of information. For
more effective and efficient exploration, the networked
information should be pre-arranged together with vigorous
improvement of search techniques. Data mining involves
techniques for machine learning, pattern recognition,
statistics, linguistics, and visualisation with the rapid
expansion of full-text and bibliographic databases on the
web. Internet navigation has become a serious concern to
libraries. Data mining is more suitable to the libraries that
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)

purchase access to full-text databases rather than
physical materials and bibliographic databases. Full-text
databases are considered one of the most important
resources in the digital libraries, especially the hybrid
libraries which contain print and offline learning materials
together. Metadata  the data about the data itself can
play important role in data mining in these databases for
the users. Whereas, in a digital library, electronic
documents should be accessible on 24x7 basis; scholars
should be able to find needed documents using search
techniques; and there should be the possibility of free
exchange of scholarly ideas and different levels of editing
for authors should be provided, which are to be expected
to be fulfilled by data mining and a step further, by
knowledge discovery in libraries. Mudhol & Gowda25, have
listed the following benefits of data mining, and of course
of the knowledge discovery in the digital libraries:


Users can apply the techniques to measure the use
patterns and reuse patterns of databases and
software



In the area of bibliometrics, to discover patterns in
unidentified knowledge areas



Data mining (knowledge discovery) techniques can
be applied to text analysis tasks such as discipline
extractions



Data mining (knowledge discovery) techniques can
be incorporated for information retrieval process for
better browsing and searching.

Data mining is considered to be an important step in
the process of knowledge discovery that emphasises the
cleaning, warehousing, and mining of knowledge in
databases. It is a form of artificial intelligence that uses
automated processes to find information. Although its use
in libraries is limited, data mining has been used
successfully for several years in the scientific, medical,
and business communities for tracking behaviour of
individuals and groups, processing medical information
and for a number of other applications.
But as stated earlier, the KDD is a step ahead of data
mining process. Classification and thesauri, that contain
condensed intelligence can be used in organising
networked information, especially metadata, to facilitate
the information resources usability and catalyse the
digital library into knowledge management centre in KDD
process. Classification and thesaurus can be merged into
a concept network and the metadata can be distributed
into the nodes of the network according to their subjects.
The abstract concept node substantiated with the related
metadata records becomes a knowledge node. This forms
a consistent knowledge network that is not only a
framework for resource organisation, but also a structure
for knowledge navigation, retrieval, and learning. The
bibliographic data are one of the most important
449

resources of library, which may be useful for knowledge
discovery process. Based on the subject indexing, the
bibliographic data can be combined with the classification
and thesaurus to form a knowledge structure, which
provides a skeleton for organisation of bibliographic data.
Corpus knowledge can be formed when new terms can be
extracted automatically from the bibliographic data to
update the classification and thesaurus. Such a
knowledge network provides the user with an opportunity
for navigation, searching, and learning in digital libraries.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The KDD technology is emerging as an empowering
tool in the development of the next generation database
and information systems through its abilities to extract
new, insightful information embedded within large
heterogeneous databases and to formulate knowledge.
Knowledge discovery in databases is rapidly growing and
its development is driven by strong research interests as
well as urgent practical, social, and economical needs.
Digital libraries are also expected to extend their
current services of modern automated libraries and
present creative environment for different multidisciplinary
projects26. There is no doubt that todays KDD tools
provide value to organisations that collect and analyse
their data and it is expected that more knowledge
discovery tools than simply creating accurate models as
in machine learning, statistics, and pattern recognition
will be evolved in future. Thus, digital librarians will be able
to fully utilise the benefits of data mining and knowledge
discovery in mining information from the huge world of
information, particularly over the net to their users is
library and information centres.
