INTRODUCTION

Technical Physics and Prototype Engineering
Division (TPPED), formerly known as Technical Physics
Division is one of the oldest divisions of Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre (BARC), which has contributed a lot to
the indigenous development of a variety of devices,
materials systems and instruments that are required for
successful implementation of atomic energy programmes
in India. The division was also involved in the transfer of
technology and commercialisation of these efforts to
institutions like IBP, Electronic Corporation of India
Limited (ECIL), Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), and
Kamal Engineering, etc. It has also supplied and
commissioned the large vacuum system for space
simulation chamber (for the Department of Space) and for
coating of large mirrors for optical telescope of Indian
Institute of Astrophysics at Kavalur. It has also supplied a
variety of indigenously fabricated mass spectrometers
and related components to different Department of Atomic
Energy (DAE) units like Heavy Water Plants and spentfuel reprocessing facilities were a few examples to
mention. Among the more challenging tasks undertaken
Received on 13 October 2008

recently are the design and assembly of beamlines for
INDUS-1 and INDUS-2. The main thrust areas of the
division in which R & D is involved are detectors, crystals,
gas sensors, glass/glass-ceramics, glass-to-metals and
ceramic-to-metal seals, synchrotron instrumentation,
UHV-based
surface
analytical
instruments,
superconductivity, organic/polymer/nano phase thin films,
and molecular devices.
The term “Naukometriya” (the Russian for
“Scientometrics”) was coined by the Russian Statistician
Nalimov, Adler and Granovsky1 for the quantitative
methods of studying the development of science.
Pritchard2 used the term “Bibliometrics” for “all studies,
which seek to quantify the process of written
communications”. He described bibiliometrics as “the
applications of mathematical methods to books and other
media of communication”. Narin3 used the term
“evaluative bibliometrics” to denote the use of bibliometric
techniques, especially publication and citation analysis in
the assessment of scientific activity. Kademani and Vijai
Kumar4-5 have
discussed
various
bibliometric,
scientometric concepts used for evaluation.
39

Over the years scientometric and bibliometric
techniques have become tools to evaluate the productivity
of research institutes, individual researcher and to map
the growth of subject. Publication and citation counts are
being extensively used for evaluation purpose of an
institute. Guay6 studied the quantitative survey of the
emergence of organic chemistry research in India during
1907-1926 covered by Chemical Abstracts. Chemists
who were conducting research in India were separated
into three distinct groups, on the basis of their cultural
identity and educational background. Important
disparities between these groups have been stated, both
in terms of research fields and publication outlets. Klaic7
carried out the analysis of 2018 papers published during
1976-1985 by the chemists from the Rugjer Boškovi
Institute (Yugoslavia). Both publications and citation
counts were used for the analysis. Kim and Kim8
examined research performance of Chemists during 199298 at Chemistry Department, Seol National University,
Korea. A total of 651 papers published by the 29 faculty
members were considered. Both publication and citation
counts were used for the study. No correlation was found
between the number of papers by a particular chemist and
the average number of citations per paper for that
chemist. Kannappanavar, Swamy and Vijay Kumar9 have
studied the authorship trend and collaborative research in
chemistry in India during 1996-2000 and reported the
trend towards multi-authorship papers. Kademani, et al.10
have carried out the scientometric analysis of 1733
papers published during 1970-1999 by the chemists from
the Chemistry Division of BARC in various domains of
chemistry. They have studied year-wise publication
productivity, collaboration trend, author productivity and
Lotka’s law, the most productive authors, use of
communication channels by the chemists and countrywise distribution of journals. A citation analysis of
publications of Chemistry Division of BARC was also
carried out by Kademani, et al.11 This paper dealt in detail
the extent of citations received, time lag of citations,
domainwise distribution of citations, citation lifecycle of
highly cited papers, citing documents etc. Kademani, et.
al.12-14 have analysed the publication productivity of
Bioorganic Division of BARC consisting of 475 papers
published during 1972-2002, 724 papers published by
Analytical Chemistry Division, BARC during 1972-2003
and 1044 papers published by Radiochemistry Division of
BARC during 1958-2005. Vinkler15 has also studied the
bibliometric analysis of publication activity of a scientific
research institute. Many scientometric studies have
appeared in the literature to focus on the performance of
science in various domains16-29.

2. OBJECTIVES
Main objective of this paper is to quantitatively
document the publication behaviour of scientists of TPPE
Division at BARC, and
40

(i)

to find out the publication productivity,

(ii) to find out domain-wise research productivity,
(iii) to find out domain-wise Activity Index,
(iv) to ascertain the authorship and collaboration pattern
of researchers,
(v)

to identify the most prolific authors and author
productivity,

(vi) to identify the types of communication channels
used by the scientists,
(vii) to find out country-wise distribution of journals,
(viii) to find out distribution of journals as per impact
factor, and
(ix) to document keywords from titles of the papers.

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Scientometric analysis of 704 publications by the
scientists of TPPED published during 1986-2006 was
done, which formed the basic data for this study. The
publications from the Vacuum Physics and
Instrumentation Division (VPID) and Mechanical Design
and Prototype Development Section (MDPDS), which
have split from TPPED are not included for the present
study.
All the bibliometric details of publications in
hardcopy form were scanned and all the data elements
were transferred to spread sheet application. After
validation, the data was analysed as per the objectives of
the study. The bibliographic fields were analysed by
normal count procedure. Full credit was given to each
author regardless of whether he happens to be the first
author or the last author. Similarly, one score was allotted
to subject, journal and keyword.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Growth of Publications
This paper traces the growth of publications of
TPPED, BARC since 1986-2006. During these 21 years,
a total of 704 publications were published. The highest
number of publications was 80 in 2006. The average
number of publications per year was 33.52. Figure 1 gives
year-wise publication productivity trend of TPPED. Figure
2 gives growth rate of publications in different three-year
blocks. During 1986-1988 the growth rate of the
publications of TPPED was very low and in the years
1992-1997 no exponential growth was observed.
Thereafter, during 1998-2000 the growth rate of the
publications was highest of all the years of the
publications. After that, there was a gradual decrease in
the growth rate in the subsequent three-year blocks of
2001-2003 and 2004-2006.

The AI for TPPED was calculated and plotted (Fig. 4).
It is clearly depicted in the Fig. 4 that how the research
efforts were devoted to various domains during seven
different three-year blocks by the TPPED. In the first
block (1986-1988) maximum emphasis was given to
Crystals followed by Miscellaneous domains and
Instrumentation while in the second block (1989-1991)
emphasis was shifted to miscellaneous, and crystals
domains respectively.
In the third block (1992-1994) the stress was laid on
Thin Films followed by Crystals and Instrumentation. In
the fourth block (1995-1997) the thrust was on Crystals
followed by Thin Films. In fifth block (1998-2000)
emphasis was given to Instrumentation followed by
Crystals. In the sixth block (2001-2003) the stress was
given to Glasses and Ceramics followed by
Instrumentation. Also in seventh block the maximum
emphasis was on Glasses and Ceramics followed by Thin
Films. Domain-wise publications and Activity in different
three-year blocks is given in Table 1 and Fig. 4.

4.4 Domain-wise Authorship Pattern
Domain-wise authorship pattern and number of
publications in each domain is presented in Table 2 and
overall authorship pattern in Fig. 5. Authorship trend is
towards multi-authorship papers. Four authored (125)
papers account for 17.76 per cent followed by five
authored papers (121) with 17.19 per cent, six authored
papers (98) with 13.92 per cent, three authored papers
(76) with 10.80 per cent and seven authored papers (70)
with 9.94 per cent. There is one paper each with sixteen
authors in domains Crystals and Instrumentation
indicating the multidisciplinary and collaborative nature of
research activity. Only 26 (3.69) publications were singleauthored. Abt17 has concluded that single-authored
papers will decrease in frequency in coming years, but
will not become extinct.

4.5 Most Prolific Authors and Author
Productivity
The prolific authors and their publications are listed
for the period 1986-2006 only. The author’s publications
prior to 1986 are not taken into consideration. The most
prolific authors were: S.K. Gupta (1986-2006) who topped
the list with 215 publications followed by G. P. Kothiyal
(1986-2006) with 171 publications, S.C. Sabharwal (19862006) with 151 publications, D.K. Aswal (1988-2006) with
139 publications, V.C. Sahni (1991-2006) with 105
publications, K.P. Muthe (1988-2006) with 101

4.8 Country-wise Distribution of Journals

4.10 Country-wise Distribution of Journals

There were 346 journals spread over 20 countries.
Table 6 gives country-wise distribution of journals and
publications. USA has published 725 publications in 116
journals followed by England 310 publications in 71
journals, Netherlands 359 publications in 56 journals,
Germany 56 publications in 29 journals, India 216
publications in 27 journals, and Switzerland 52
publications in 14 journals.

Journals most preferred for publication of papers were
from the Netherlands with 91 (27.74 per cent) publications
followed by India 79 (24.09 per cent), USA with 75 (22.87
per cent) publications, England with 44 (13.41 per cent)
publications and Switzerland with 19 (5.79 per cent)
publications. Figure 9 gives the country-wise distribution
of journals and publications.

4.9 Impact Factor-wise Distribution of Journals
and Publications
Figure 8 provides the distribution of publications in
journals as per their impact factors (IF). The publications
were published in the journals with IF ranging from 0.01 to
10.00. More than 21 percent of the publications were
published in the journals with impact factors ranging from
0.51 to 1.00. About 15 percent of the publications were
published in the journals which are not covered by
Science Citation Index- Journal Citation Report -2005.

4.11 Documentation of Keywords Appeared in
the Titles of the Papers
Title of a publication conveys the thought contents of
the paper. The potency of information concentrated on the
title of the paper is more than the rest of the sections of
the paper. Therefore, if a word occurs more frequently than
expected, it reflects the emphasis given by the authors
about the research field of their interest. The important
words called ‘keywords’ are one of the best indicators to
understand and grasp instantaneously the thought
content of the papers, methodologies used and areas of

research such as crystals (192), thin films (173),
miscellaneous domains (171), glasses and ceramics
(102) and instrumentation (66). The highest number of
publications (80) was produced in 2006. The average
number of publications per year was 33.52. The study of
activity index in various domains in different three year
blocks shows that the maximum emphasis was given to
domain crystals followed by miscellaneous domains in
the first block (1986-1988) while the emphasis shifted to
miscellaneous domains followed by crystals in the
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(2)

second block (1989-1991). During the third block (19921994) the stress was laid on thin films followed by
crystals. In the fourth block (1995-1997) the importance
was given to crystals followed by thin films and in the fifth
block (1998-2000) interest was shifted to Instrumentation
followed by Crystals and the emphasis was on Glasses
and Ceramics in sixth (2001-2003) and seventh (20042006) blocks. Major channel of communication used by
the scientists of TPPED was conferences during this
period. The collaboration trend among the scientists
51

towards multi-authored papers is indicative of the highly
specialised areas of scientific work that they were
engaged in. The publication behaviour of scientists shows
that they were highly selective in publishing their research
results in highly specialised journals. It would be quite
interesting to study other qualitative indicators based on
citations, participation in international meetings,
academic qualifications and awards received by these
scientists.
