ABSTRACT
The paper describes an attempt made to identify the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology
(RRCAT) library users’ information needs by using data of inter-library loan (ILL) requests. ILL requests
received for the year 2005 and 2006 were analysed. There were 688 documents requested during this period.
The parameters studied were: frequently requested journals, and currency of users’ information seeking by
analysing publication year of all requested documents. The study found that 16 (5.95 per cent) journals were
the most frequently requested journals, in which 31.8 per cent of requested documents had been published.
About 50 per cent of the requested documents were published since 1995. The results show that RRCAT
library users are heavily seeking information from selected items and those that were published in the past
few years.
Keywords: User needs, information, library user studies, inter-library loan, library collection development.

1. INTRODUCTION
Many disciplines in science are heavily researched,
thus topics are changing in a rapid manner. Also,
the literature in science and technology is growing
at an exponential rate, therefore, it has become
essential to assess the information needs of the
users periodically to customise value-added services
and resources. In a science and technology library,
collection development is the third important function
out of five primary functions.1 The collection development
function entirely depends on the mission and goals
of the parent body in respect to the research, educational,
recreational and other day-to-day information requirements
of the users that it serves. It determines the library
collection’s scope and depth, and the services offered.
Traditional methods of collection development are:
use of librarian or user subject specialists, user
recommendations, and approval plans. The information
requirements of users vary with their educational
background, work assignments, time, geography,
organisation, age, availability of technological facilities,

and other factors. To identify user information needs,
librarians conduct surveys, distribute questionnaires,
interview, and also analyse the circulation data,
external and internal inter-library loan requests data,
and web log data. All these methods help to identify
information needs of users only to some degree,
not completely.
RRCAT is a premier research and development
organisation in the area of lasers, accelerators and
its related disciplines. There are about 500 scientists
and engineers engaged in R&D activities, and 500
scientific/technical support staff. The RRCAT library
since its inception is offering various information
services actively to all its users and visitors. ILL
is one such service offered to users for on-demand
materials that are not available locally due to the
proliferation of material and limited library budgets.
The ILL service is the last of the five main functions
of any science and technology library. 1 The online
dictionary for library and information science (ODLIS)
defines ILL as , “When a book or other item needed

by a registered borrower is checked out, unavailable
for some other reason, or not owned by the library,
a patron may request that it be borrowed from
another library by filling out a printed ILL request
form at a service desk, or electronically via the
library’s website. Some libraries also accept ILL
requests via e-mail or by telephone, usually under
exceptional circumstances. Materials borrowed on
ILL may usually be renewed on or before the due
date”2 . The term ILL is also referred to as ‘document
delivery (DD)’ and ‘resource sharing’. The term DD
is used, rather than ILL, because organisations
other than libraries engage in providing documents,
both originals and copies to other organisations 3 .
The ILL requests received in the years 2005 and
2006 at RRCAT were analysed to determine frequently
referred to journals by the users from those nonsubscribed journals. The currency of information
sought by the users was also determined by examining
the publication year of all the requested documents.

2. PRESENT LIBRARY RESOURCES
RRCAT library collection is up-to-date, with texts,
periodicals and other research materials carefully
chosen by experienced scientists and engineers.
This includes 10,000 books; 1,000 standards; 3,500
scientific/technical reports; 3,000 photographs; 1,000
e-books and proceedings on CD-ROM, videotapes
and back volumes. The library is currently subscribing
175 print/online journals, plus Sciencedirect, Physical
Review Online Archive (PROLA) and the Institute of
Physics (IOP) journal archive. Users can access
up-to-date information relating to various resources
such as item availability status, subscription status
of online/electronic resources, etc. through library’s
Intranet-based WebOPAC (Web-based Online Public
Access Catalogue) from their desktops.

as 1,370 records relating to this topic, against the
search query “inter-library loan”+”document
delivery”+”analysis”. A review article appends 228
references concerning ILL, DD, and resource sharing
from 1995 to 2000 is one other example. 4 It was
also the topic of 1993 ALA Collection Development
and Evaluation Section (CODES) annual program. 5
ALA recognised this method in 1994 by stating that
ILL is an integral element of collection development
for all libraries.6 The ‘access versus ownership debate’
is the most common topic based on ILL/DD data. 7
In one specific study, the article reported usage
of ILL/DD data at Louisiana State University libraries
for collection monitoring, assessment of faculty
members’ journal needs, and sharing of resources
among libraries 8. Another study assessed the collections
of Veterinary Medical Library at Auburn University
by using DD data, and reported the collection weaknesses
and requirements for new acquisitions 9. The Purdue
Libraries study on patron requests suggested two
new models for collection development using patron
requests. 10 The study conducted at the University
of Colorado libraries analysed the library collection
with circulation and ILL borrowing request data and
explained the changes made according to users
borrowing patterns.11 Byred, et al. used the statistics
gathered using ILL borrowing for books to assess
the strengths and weaknesses of library book collection
in relation to user demands. 1 2

Frequently requested journals for journal selection

E.M. Lacroix and G.A. Dutcher compared 1,959
and 1,984 ILL requests data filled by the National
Library of Medicine and found that only a small
percentage of serial holdings was utilised to provide
service. 13 Bleeker, et al. examined 60, 779 external
ILL requests at the Brasmus University Medical
Library in 1988 and reported 50 per cent of requested
documents were published in the most recent two
years period, and 90 per cent of requests could be
filled from a 21 run of serials. The study also reported
that 4,157 internal requests were analyed for journals
not belonging to the collections in order to identify
the most frequently sought titles. 1 4

Using ILL/DD data for collection management,
development, and redesigning systems and services
is not new in libraries. Professionals have conducted
numerous studies at various levels and published
papers in journals, proceedings, books, etc. on

Library user(s) of RRCAT library submit request(s)
for required document(s) through an Intranet-based
ILL form by filling in bibliographic details. All requests
submitted from the beginning of 2005 until the end
of 2006 were used for this study after excluding
those materials that are part of the library holdings
and were requested by users unknowingly. This
data was analysed using Microsoft Excel. There
were 688 document requests made during this period;
57

336 documents in the year 2005, and 352 documents
in the year 2006. In some records users entered
abbreviated journal title, and in some records the
year of publication was not included. Those records
were completed with correct data, sorted and counted.

number of requested documents. It shows some
correlation between the users information seeking
behaviour and impact factors.

6. RESULTS

The 688 documents requested were published
during 1922-2006. The publication year of all requested
documents in relation to number/percentage of documents
is presented in Fig. 2. It shows that the information
seeking nature of users heavily depends on the
past few years’ publications. That is about 50 per
cent of documents were published since 1995. From
the 356 requests in the year 2006, 31 (8.7 per cent)
documents requested were published in the same
year. Similarly, in 2005, 25 (7.5 per cent) documents
out of 388 requested were also published in the
same year. All together 9.44 per cent requested
documents were published in the year 2004 alone,
which is higher than all publication years. This
shows current information seeking pattern. The decline
in the number of documents requests from the
current year to previous years also can be seen in
the Fig. 2.

The journal(s) from which document(s) were
requested repeatedly were identified in this parameter.
The number of requests made was drastically low,
since subscription to many online resources was
initiated just few years before 2005; and also users
acquire some material electronically through open
access sources such as e-print servers, institutional
repositories, and author personal web pages. It
was found that there were 269 journals in which all
688 requested documents were scattered. About
25 per cent of documents requested were from only
11 journals, nearly 50 per cent of documents from
37 journals, and 76.6 per cent from just 40 per cent
of the journals. From the 269 source publications
161(59.9 per cent) of the journals received only one
document request. Figure 1 depicts cumulative
percentage of journals in relation to cumulative percentage
of material requests. Out of 269 journals, 16 frequently
requested journals had nine plus document requests
per title (Appendix 1). These 16 (5.95 per cent)
journals have published 31.8 per cent of requested
documents. Out of the list, the library has now
subscribed to four journals. For the requests that
are not in our holdings, the library may consider
purchasing back volumes. Nine newly identified journals
may also be considered for subscription. The Journal
Citation Reports (JCR) impact factor values of these
journals are also in decreasing order in terms of

6.1 Frequently Requested Journals

6.2 Currency of Users Information Requests

As mentioned, ILL/DD request data analysis
helps only to some degree like any other information
needs assessment method. This study helped to
fill the gap of present library collections. It found
16 most frequently requested journals, which published
more than nine requested documents. It also found
that users seek information from only the past few
years’ publications. Therefore while selecting/choosing
books and related documents for the library currency,
contents should be verified thoroughly, and also the
less used back volumes may be shifted to repository
in order to save the space in the library. The results
obtained for most frequently requested journals were
submitted to the authorities for consideration for
future subscriptions.
