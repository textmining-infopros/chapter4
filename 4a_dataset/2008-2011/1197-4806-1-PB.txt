ABSTRACT
This paper discusses the Indian chemical research activity during 1987 to 2007 using Scopus database.
It tries to quantify the national contribution to world efforts, and identify areas of relative strengths and
weaknesses. It also models out the trend of growth in the output of Indian chemical research to world as
a whole and in sub-fields of chemical science. These details have been discussed by using the activity
index for the world and India. It also estimates the contribution of different institutions and sub-specialties
in chemical sciences.
Keywords: Chemical science, research output, activity index, scientometrics, India, world

1. INTRODUCTION
Knowledge is science. Nowadays, the importance of
knowledge has been recognised and every country is
trying to improve their knowledge base, since knowledge
is power. Therefore, there is a tremendous growth in the
knowledge world over, of course with differences in their
growth geographically. Due to this increase, channels of
communication for science like research articles,
patents, chapters in books, conference proceedings,
etc., been increased. Therefore, quantification of
research output of an institution/a country is a topic of
interest for all. Especially, it is very useful to the
managers of scientific activity in decision making
towards the direction of scientific research, allocation of
funds, and identifying the bottle necks in the growth of
research.
Presently, chemical science research is being
treated as one of the world’s leading and essential
research compared to all other subject areas, as
chemistry is a field that has undergone significant
changes during the past two decades. It has been
expanding very fast and had sub-specialties like organic,
inorganic, applied chemistry, etc. But no one can audit
accurately regarding which field is important and in the
same way it is difficult to identify which institution is
providing the best knowledge with regard to their
research.
Received: 03 March 2011; Revised: 17 March 2011

This has resulted in a comprehensive development of
chemical science literature in the form of research
articles in scientific journals, patents, technical reports,
conference proceedings, books, and monographs
emanating from different nations and different institutions
situated in different parts of the world.
Bibliometric studies, particularly, dealing with
different aspects of chemical research have been
carried out by Magyar1, Granberg2, Jain & Garg3,
Noyons4, Garg & Padhi5-9, and Vlachy10.
Objective of the present study is to discuss the Indian
chemical science research activity during the 1987-2007
period using the Scopus database to focus on the
following aspects:
•

To compare world output vs. India’s output in
chemistry in terms of the number of publications for
1987-2007 on a year by year basis.

•

To study the change in priorities of chemical science
research during 1987 to 2007 for India as well as the
world, its sub-fields and also to identify the areas of
strengths and weaknesses of Indian chemistry.

•

To study world and Indian literature output for
different sub-fields of chemistry and also for
different types of institutions.

•

To identify most productive institutions and their
activity profile of India.

2. DATA, METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS
Data has been taken from Scopus, the largest
database of 15,000 peer-reviewed journals from more
than 4,000 international publishers, ensuring broad
interdisciplinary coverage with h-index and its visual aids
that help authors, department heads and university
administrators to track and interpret their performance11.
Therefore, Scopus has been considered as a basic
source for bibliometric data for chemistry research
output for the present study. Scopus, having a wider
scope, includes peripheral journals also in its database to
quantify the exact proportion.
The search query used while searching the database
for retrieving the publications data of about 79118 papers
by the Indian scientists in the field of chemical sciences
during the period of study is as follows:
Set 1––India in affiliation field and period 1987 to 2007
Set 2––Limiting chemistry in subject field

AI<100 indicates lower activity than the world’s average.
Here, AI for India has been calculated for different
years to analyse how India’s performance changed
during different years using the above formula, but in a
modified way suggested by Price16 and used by Karki &
Garg17 in their study on alkaloid chemistry research in
India. Here, AI has been calculated as followed:
AI = {(India’s output in a particular year)/(Total Indian
output)}/{(World’s output in a particular year)/
(Total world’s output)} x 100
Mathematically, AI = {(Ii/Io)/(Wi/Wo)} x 100
Here, Ii is the Indian output in the year i; Io is the total
Indian output; Wi is the world output in the year i; and Wo
is the total world output. Table 1 presents the results of the
AI of India in the field of chemical science. It indicates
that India’s effort in chemical science were lower than
world during the first two years (1987 and 1988) and also

However, there were certain limitations to the
present study, because of the limitations in Scopus
database coverage of publications for pre-1996 period
as the publishers of Scopus database (Elsevier) do not
claim the completeness of coverage for pre-1996 period.

3.1 World Output Vs. Indian Output
Data contains total publications of 79118 by Indian
scientists in the field of chemical science during the
period of study. The total publication output constituted
about 6.03 per cent of the world output. Here, activity
index (AI) suggested by Frame12 and elaborated by
Schubert & Braun13, Garg,14 & Nagpaul,15 has been used
to compare India’s research performance with the
world’s research performance. The AI characterises the
relative research effort of a country in a given subject
field. It is defined as:
AI= Given field’s share in the country’s publication
outputs)/(Given field’s share in the world’s
publication output.
AI= 100 indicates that the country’s research effort in the
given field corresponds precisely to the world’s
average.
AI>100 reflects higher activity than the world’s average,

for 1996 to 2002. However, as reflected by the values of
the AI, the activity has picked up during 1989-1995 and
also during 2003-2007. It was at peak in 1991. The
average value of the AI for India during 1987-2007 was
100.9 which indicates that India’s research effort in
chemical science was slightly more when compared to
the world average.

output for different sub specialties of chemical science
have been shown in Figs 2(a) and 2(b) for the period of
study, viz.,1987-2007. For convenience sake the main
field chemistry has been divided into four subfields, viz.,
organic, inorganic, applied chemistry and miscellaneous
chemistry. If AI > 100, it implies higher activity than world
average in case of world and India’s average in case of
India and vice versa if AI<100.

Other features of output, as reflected by the plots of
the output for world (Fig. 1(a)) and India (Fig. 1(b))
indicate that the world output grew steeply during 199596 and from then onwards a steady increasing pace has
been maintained upto 2007. In case of the Indian output
also there is a steep growth during 1995-96 with an
inconsistent growth rate upto 2001 and from then
onwards a steady increasing pace has been maintained
upto 2007.

In Table 2, it was observed that in case of world data
during 1987-1996 the priorities have been given to
miscellaneous chemistry and from 1996 onwards upto
2007 organic and inorganic chemistry have been given
more priorities. From 2000 onwards applied chemistry
has also shown the same trend like organic and
inorganic chemistry with having high activity but with a
consistent increase in growth rate. India has also shown
the same trend like the world. From 1987-1995 the value
of AI for miscellaneous chemistry was high and from
1996-2007 organic and inorganic chemistry have shown
higher priority indices. From 2001 onwards, applied
chemistry has also shown almost the same trend like
organic and inorganic chemistry with high AI but with a
consistent increase in growth rate.The measure of shift

in the AI for various sub-fields indicates that presently,
organic, inorganic, and applied chemistry research are
the current areas of strength, while miscellaneous
chemistry research is the weak area of research both for
world and India. From the Figs 2(a) and 2(b) it is evident
that 1995 and 1996 were crucial for world and India,
respectively, where there were prominent changes in
research output of sub-specialties of chemical science.

3.3 Sub-fields of Study by Institutions
It has been observed that universities and research
institutions were the primary centres of scientific
research in India. In order to examine the priority given
by these institutions to different sub-specialties of
chemical science, AI has been used for comparing
different types of institutions. However, in the present
context the AI for different types of institutions have been
calculated to identify the emphasis given by these
institutions to different sub-specialties of chemical
science.
Here, AI has been defined as follows:
AI = {(Output of a particular type of institution in a
particular sub-specialty)/(Total output in all subspecialties of that type of institutions)}{(Total output of
different type of institutions in that sub-specialty)/(Total
output)} x 100
Similar to the AI calculated for different subspecialties of chemical science, the same is true with the
AI of different types of institutions for world and India. If
AI >100, it implies higher activity than world average in
case of world and India's average in case of India and
vice versa if AI<100.
In Table 3 the data on research publications
produced by different types of institutions like

universities, R&D organisations, private/industrial and
other organisations have been given. Other organisations
include colleges, affiliated bodies, NGOs, etc. The
research output of world and India in different subspecialties along with their AI have been given.Data
indicate that the research output for different types of
institutions for world is: Universities>R&D> private
institutions>others. Whereas in India, the trend in
different
types
of
institutions
is:
R&D>universities>private institutions>others
Similarly, it has been observed that the research
output for different types of sub-fields for world has been:
Organic
chemistry>applied
chemistry>inorganic
chemistry >miscellaneous chemistry
For India the following sequence has been observed:
Organic chemistry>miscellaneous chemistry>inorganic
chemistry>applied chemistry
From the AI it was evident that in case of world except
other type of institutions and miscellaneous chemistry,
rest of the institutions (i.e., universities, R&D, and
private) and other sub-fields (organic, inorganic, and
applied) have relatively high AI. But in case of India,
except miscellaneous chemistry the other sub-fields in
universities have greater activity index. Similarly, except
inorganic chemistry rest other sub-fields in R&D
institutions have high AI. But in private only applied and
miscellaneous chemistry have high activity index. From
this it has been inferred that the patterns of priorities in
university for world and India were similar. Whereas, in
case of R&D institutions India has shown an opposite
trend to world by showing high priorities for
miscellaneous chemistry and low in inorganic chemistry.
In case of private/industries India has shown an opposite
trend to world by having low priorities for organic and
inorganic and high in miscellaneous chemistry and same

trend for applied chemistry. In other type of institutions
less priority has been given to all sub-specialties of
chemical sciences for both world and India.

3.4 Activity Profile of Highly Productive
Institutions
The results of output for highly productive top 10
institutions in scientific literature in different subspecialties of chemical science were shown in Table 4.
Data indicates a considerable difference in the
publication output of the institutions in different subspecialties. These differences in the publication output
can best be comprehended by using AI. In Table 4 from
India’s activity profile for different sub-specialties in
chemical science the following observations were made:
In case of organic chemistry, 70 per cent of
institutions have shown high AI (>100) except Bhabha
Atomic Research Centre, Jadavpur University, Indian
Institute of Technology, Madras and other types of
institutions with low AI<100. Among the high activity
profile institutions, top three were Indian Institute of
Chemical Technology, National Chemical Laboratory,
and University of Delhi, respectively.
In case of inorganic chemistry also 70 per cent of
institutions have shown high AI (>100) except Indian
Institute of Chemical Technology, National Chemical
Laboratory and other types of institutions with low
AI<100. Whereas activity index of Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras was equal to the Indian average
(AI=100). Among the high activity profile institutions, the
top three were Jadavpur University, Indian Association
for the Cultivation of Science, and Indian Institute of
Technology, Bombay respectively.
392

In case of applied chemistry, 60 per cent of
institutions have shown high AI>100 except Indian
Institute of Chemical Technology, Indian Association for
the Cultivation of Science, Jadavpur University, Indian
Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and other types of
institutions with low activity indices (AI<100). Among the
high activity profile institutions, the top three were
National Chemical Laboratory, Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras, and Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre, respectively. In case of miscellaneous chemistry
only Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and other types of
institutions have shown high AI>100 and rest showing low
activity indices.
From the above discussion it has been inferred that
out of the highly productive institutions, 70 per cent have
given emphasis to both organic and inorganic chemistry
and 60 per cent institutions have given emphasis to
applied chemistry. Only Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
and other type of institutions have given emphasis to
miscellaneous chemistry.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Some findings of the study are:

•

The average value of the AI for India during 19872007 is 100.9 which indicate that India's research
effort in chemical science is more when compared to
the world average.

•

The measure of shift in the AI for various sub-fields
indicates that presently organic, inorganic, and
applied chemistry research are the current areas of
strength, while miscellaneous chemistry research is
the weak area of research both for world and India.

•

India has shown an opposite trend to world in case of
R&D institutions by showing high priorities for
miscellaneous chemistry and low in inorganic
chemistry.

•

India has also shown opposite trend to world in case
of private/industries by having low priorities in
organic and inorganic and high in miscellaneous and
same trend for applied chemistry.
Indian Institute of Chemical Technology leads top
position in organic chemistry followed by National
Chemical Laboratory and University of Delhi,
whereas in inorganic chemistry, Jadavpur University
scores top position followed by Indian Association for
the Cultivation of Science and Indian Institute of
Technology, Bombay.

•

In case of applied chemistry, National Chemical
Laboratory leads with top position followed by Indian
Institute of Technology, Madras and Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre.

•

In case of miscellaneous chemistry, Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre scores top position among these
ten institutions.

Out of the highly productive institutions, 70 per cent
have given importance to both organic and inorganic
chemistry and 60 per cent institutions have given
importance to applied chemistry. Only Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre has given importance to miscellaneous
chemistry.
