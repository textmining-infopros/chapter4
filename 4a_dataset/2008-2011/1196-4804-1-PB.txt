Qualifying Scholarly Impact using an
iCX (impact-Citations-Exergy) Analysis

ABSTRACT
A scholarly ‘index of quality and productivity’ (IQp) was proposed as a better alternative to the hindex. This was intended to overcome some of the limitations of the h-index. Other recent studies have
shown that an indicator called the performance index (p-index) can also effectively combine size and
quality of scientific papers. The curious structure of the p-index led to an energy-like term, X = iC = Pi2
= C.(C/P), where, P is the number of papers, and i is a proxy for quality Q = C/P. The energy assessment
technique (iCX audit for impact-Citations-Exergy) which emerges from this is seen to be a quick and simple
tool for visualising the quality and productivity (size or quantity) of a scientist’s oeuvre.
Keywords: Scientometrics, quality, iCX analysis, h-index, impact-Citations-Exergy

1. INTRODUCTION
The h-index1 tries to capture in a single number, the
quality and quantity of a scientist’s (or at higher levels of
aggregation, that of journals, groups of scientists,
institutions, and even countries) output. This
simplification of a very complex process has been found
to be very effective, especially in instances where h
tends to be high. It also has many shortcomings
especially when h tends to be low or where there are tall
cores or long tails2-4. The search for a rational strategy to
rank entities (authors, groups, institutions, or countries)
taking into account productivity (number of papers P)
and quality (impact defined as the ratio of citations to
papers, i = C/P) continues. Prathap2 proposed a
composite indicator (C2/P)1/3, which could mock the
features of the h-index and having the same dimensions
as h and P, connecting the number of papers and the
mean citation rate per paper. Thus, (C2/P)1/3 = (C.(C/P))1/
3
is an indicator that senses both size and quality. This
leads to an interesting energy analogy. While the actual
dispersion of citations cj for papers j = 1 to P can have
complex statistical and thermodynamic features, it would
seem that an energy (or power) like property is reflected
in the term C2/P. Many physically intuitive situations can
be found as parallels (e.g., flow of current in a circuit,
hydraulic flow driven by pressure difference, etc.). The
simplest analogy that can be used is found from Ohm’s

law. The impact of a body of scientific work (represented
by a total of P papers), is here designated by i, as the
current that flows through this. The higher the impact of
the work, the greater will be the number of citations it will
invite and thus C is analogous to the voltage that will build
up across a resistance R through which a current i is
passing through.
Table 1 shows the analogy. One can see immediately
that a body of scientific work will have an illuminating
power as shown in the last row of Table 1 (X = iC = i2P =
C2/P). The physical picture that emerges has curious
parallels.
The proxy for the energy of ideas turns out to be
X = Pi2, where, P is measured in the units in which ideas
are conveyed (here, the number of papers) and i is a
measure of the rate at which ideas are transmitted as
citations (here, a proxy for quality i = C/P). It is more
appropriate to call this energy-like term, exergy (as a
useful externally available energy, rather than the total
internal energy).

Both the h-index and the p-index are attractive
because of the simplicity with which a single number
could be used to quantify the impact of scholarship and
its quality. In this regard, Antonakis & Lalive5 proposed a
new index, the IQp (index of quality and productivity) and
tested and calibrated this new index and compared its
performance relative to the h-index using a sample of top
scholars with bibliometric data from ISI’s Web of
Knowledge.
The spirit and scope of the IQp can be summed up
as: Scholarly achievement is assumed to depend on the
multiplicative association of quality and productivity6,7.
The IQp measures a scholar’s impact along two
dimensions: Quality (i.e., citations) and productivity (i.e.,
output). Antonakis & Lalive5 approximates quality by
‘adjusting’ for total number of citations (C) and for
productivity by ‘adjusting’ for total number of papers (P)
and this leads to a complex and non-trivial expression for
IQp.
Prathap’s approach is simpler in this respect: C is
taken as a measure of size/quantity and this is then
weighted by taking quality (impact, i.e., i = C/P) so that
the multiplicative product C2/P = iC = X is a measure of
the ‘energy’ of scholarship. Very interestingly, taking a
lead from Glanzel’s pioneering statistical studies, it can
also be established that X(1/3) = p has the units of h and
indeed can be used as a mock h-index2-4. In this paper, it
is shown that i, C, and X can be combined graphically
into an iCX map which can then be displayed as a two
dimensional contour map which reproduces the essential
topological features of Fig. 1 of Antonakis & Lalive5.

2. TESTING IMPACT-CITATIONS-EXERGY
APPROACH
The bibliometric statistics that was used by Antonakis
& Lalive5 is used here and Table 2 reflects this with i, X,
and p added. The descriptive statistics for all the scholars
and disciplines that goes along with Table 2 has been
elaborately given in paper by Antonakis & Lalive5 and will
not be repeated here.
The relationship between quality and size is captured
on an impact-Citations-Exergy (iCX) landscape shown in
Fig. 1. On the x-axis, the quantity of output and on the yaxis, quality of output is represented.

i for quality

However, a further elaboration of this is beyond the
scope of this paper. To compare the research
performance of entities, it will be more meaningful to
compare exergies rather than papers and/or citations. It
is illustrated this with reference to the research
assessment of some leading research scientists and
some with more modest contributions at early stages of
their career as reported in Antonakis & Lalive5.

C for size

Figure 1. Relationship between quality and size in an iCX
map is a topologically deformed equivalent of Figure
1 of Antonakis & Lavile5 .

It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the relationship
between quality and size in an iCX map is a topologically
deformed equivalent of Fig. 1 of Antonakis & Lavile5.
However, since X = iC, contour lines can easily be
plotted on the map and these are shown by dotted lines
for X = 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m. Metaphorically, this can be
interpreted as climbing a peak, equating higher levels of
performance as having scaled higher heights of a
quantity-quality landscape. It can be seen that the effect
of citation rates being field-specific in some disciplines, it
is easier to scale up to greater heights. It can be noted
that the scientists at early stages of their career
(randomly selected Society of Industrial and
Organisational Psychology Fellows and Members) are
understandably at the base of the energy mountain.
Taken together, Table 2 and Fig. 1 confirm the
findings of Antonakis & Lalive5, namely that, the h-index
is not a useful indicator of scholarly performance. Here,
it emphasises the distinction authors make between
quality (i = C/P) and performance (X = C/P.C = iC).
Thus, among the various disciplines, Kahneman is
the highest performing Economist, Tversky, and
Cronbach lead among the Psychologists in this sample,
and Glauber, Wuthrich and Furchgott excel in the
physics, chemistry, and medicine categories. These are
identical to what the IQp would have led us to. However,

Studies introducing the performance index (p-index)
as a mock h-index, which can effectively combine size
and quality of scientific papers, led us to the curious
possibility of using an energy approach. The power/
energy basis for bibliometric research assessment
allows us to argue that a body of scientific work will have
an illuminating power given by X = iC = i2P = C2/P. This
can easily be displayed on an iCX map. It is shown with
recently published data5 that the iCX analysis comes to
the same conclusions as the more discriminating IQp
approach in locating scholarship of the highest
performance, but needing to use only the most
parsimonious of data and assumptions.
As proposed in Antonakis & Lalive5, one can easily
introduce ‘adjustments’ to take into account fieldspecificity of citation rates, and scientific age to the Xindex.
