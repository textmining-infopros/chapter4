ABSTRACT
The advent of Internet and its resources have revolutionised the academic world. A significant transition
can be seen in the academic communities approach and the way they seek information, and the methods they
employ for teaching and learning activities. This paper is based on a research project, funded by the University
Grants Commission, to analyse the patterns of use of Internet among the teachers and the students of the first
grade colleges in Mangalore city. The study also investigated the level of academic community’s access to the
Internet, reasons for non-use of Internet, satisfaction with the Internet facilities provided in these institutions
as well as the problems faced in the use of Internet.
A well structured questionnaire was distributed among the 390 teachers and students of the five colleges
in the Mangalore city. Out of which 335 questionnaires were received back duly filled in. The response rate
was 85.9 per cent. The study revealed that the level of student’s access to the Internet was low and the major
reason was that at the time of the study, computers with Internet facilities were inadequate. The findings also
revealed that the rate of Internet use was more among the teachers and students of Commerce and Science
faculty as compared to the faculty of Arts. However, majority of the students expressed their interest in the
use of Internet and its resources and were enthusiastic in improving their skills in the use of the Internet. The
study recommends the provision of more computers with Internet facilities, better access speed, and providing
more orientation/training programmes in the use of Internet in these institutions.
Keywords: Internet, use pattern, first grade colleges, Mangalore

1. INTRODUCTION
In the era of networked information, Internet, the
largest worldwide network of networks, has emerged as
a powerful educational tool for an instant access to
information. It has made a tremendous impact on the
academic activities of the teachers and students.
Information is just a ‘finger touch’ away from the user
and it would not be inappropriate to say that the Internet
has become the biggest global digital information library,
which provides the fastest access to the right kind of
information in nano-seconds to end user at any time and
at any place in the world.
With the advent of Internet, a significant transition
can be seen in the academic communities’ approach
and the way they seek information and the methods
they employ for teaching and learning activities. This
has become possible as Internet provides a wealth of
current information and delivers text, graphics, images,
audios and videos at the same time. It acts as a

powerful supplement to the traditional ways of studying
and learning. The Internet can provide access to
essentially unlimited resources of information, not
conventionally obtainable through other means.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
There have been a number of research studies on
the use of Internet, especially in the developed
countries. Some of these studies measure usefulness;
some have focused on accessibility, while others have
combined all these. A review of literature reveals that the
teachers and students are the most frequent users of
Internet. They use Internet for teaching, learning and for
research purposes.
In the USA, several studies have been carried out
addressing the issue of who uses the Internet and for
what1. Other studies have focused specially on particular
groups. For example some have focused on teachers
and students. Becker2 conducted a study on the Internet
35

use by 2250 teachers from public and private schools in
the US. The study revealed that 90 per cent of the
teachers had Internet access. A majority of the teachers
(68 per cent) used Internet to find information resources
for preparing their lessons.
A recent study by Asemi showed that all the
respondents were using the Internet frequently because
all faculties were provided connection to the Internet. It
was revealed that the students of the university were
getting quality information through the Internet.
Robinson4 examined the Internet use among AfricanAmerican college students. The respondents were
surveyed by using the 43-item questionnaire to
determine the frequency of Internet. The results of the
study indicated that most of the African-American
college students (76 per cent) had used the Internet for
more than three years.

3. OBJECTIVES
The study was conducted with the following specific
objectives:


To study the use of Internet by the teachers and
students in the degree college under study.



To identify the different purposes of using Internet
by the academic community.



To identify the constraints encountered by the
respondents while using the Internet.



To assess the satisfaction level of the Internet
facilities provided by the under graduate colleges
under study.



To suggest ways of providing better Internet services
to the users.

3

The use of Internet by most students was at school
or at workplace with 49 per cent of the responses at
home. They (47 per cent) spent an average of 2 hours
per day online. 43 per cent of the students used Internet
primarily to learn and find school resources. Adeyinka5
conducted a survey of the undergraduates use of
Internet and its implications on their academic
performance at the University of Botswana. The results
indicated that majority of respondents (66 per cent)
accessed Internet 1-5 h per week. Moreover, most
respondents used Internet for obtaining course-related
information.
The results also revealed that Internet contributes
significantly to academic performance of the
respondents. Rajeev6 studied the use of the Internet and
the electronic resources among the dental science
students and found that 56.8 per cent of the
respondents acquired the skills to use Internet and the
electronic sources via trial and error method, followed by
guidance from friends and colleagues. E-mail was
chosen as the most popular Internet service and
majority were fully satisfied with the Internet and the
electronic resources. Khare7, et al. conducted a survey
to study the pattern of Internet use, satisfaction with the
search results, etc. among the research scholars of the
various faculties at H.S. Gour University, Sagar, M.P.
The findings showed that the research scholars used
Internet for research purpose, entertainment, as well as
for job search.
Many studies on the use of Internet have been
conducted, but few have focused on the academic
community of undergraduate colleges. This study is
therefore an attempt to investigate the use of Internet
among the teachers and students of the First Grade
Colleges of Mangalore city.

4. METHODOLOGY
The five under graduate colleges of Mangalore city
having arts, commerce, and science faculties were
selected for the study and were visited personally by the
investigator to collect data from the respondents. A total
sample of 390, 120 teachers and 270 undergraduate
students, was taken up for the study. For sampling,
random sampling process was followed for data
collection. The teachers and students were randomly
selected, in equal proportion, from the science,
humanities, and commerce faculties. Out of 390
questionnaires, 335 were duly filled and returned
accounting to 85.9 per cent. The data collected from the
teachers and students was further computed and
interpreted using simple statistical techniques like
frequency, percentages as well as other statistical tools
such as weighted mean and standard deviation to
analyse the data.

5. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
The research study is confined to the colleges in
the Mangalore city having permanent affiliation from the
Mangalore University all the combination of science, arts
and commerce faculty. The following colleges were
selected for the study:

6. ANALYSIS

reasons for their not using the Internet (Table 3). Table 3
shows that 44.6 per cent of the respondents did not
used the Internet because they needed training, 24.6 per
cent had no interest in using it whereas 16.9 per cent
were not using since the institution was not having
proper Internet facility. Also, 9.2 per cent of the
respondents did not felt its necessity and 4.62 per cent
had other reasons such as language-related problems, etc.

6.1 Characteristics of Study Population
Table 1 shows that more than one-third, 241 (71.9
per cent), of study population comprised students, and
94 (28.1 per cent) teachers. The respondents comprised
260 (77.6 per cent) females and 75 (22.4 per cent)
males.

6.3 Experience of Internet Use

6.2 Internet Use

Figure 1 shows that out of the 270 Internet users,
more than one third of the respondents were using
Internet for more than four years. Whereas 22.2 per cent
of the academic community were using it for 1-2 years
and 15.9 per cent were using Internet for 2-4 years. Rest
of the respondents were using it for less than a year.
The analysis indicates that half of the respondents were
using Internet on an average for more than 2 years.

Table 2 shows that of the total 335 respondents,
270 used Internet. To ascertain the Internet use by the
teachers and the students, a faculty-wise break up of
the respondents is shown in Table 2. It shows that
fluctuation in the use of Internet among different
faculties. Nearly half (49.2 per cent) of the arts faculty
did not used the Internet, while among the science
faculty only 15.4 per cent of the respondents were nonusers of the Internet. Among the Internet users, it was
found that 39.3 per cent of the commerce faculty and 37
per cent of the science faculty were Internet users while
only 23.7 per cent of the arts faculty were Internet users.

6.4 Frequency of Internet Use
To access the frequency of using the Internet
services, the time was classified into four different
categories: daily, 2-3 times a week, 2-3 times a month,
and once in a month. It was found that 35.9 per cent

Sixty-five (19.4 per cent) respondents, who were not
using the Internet were further queried to understand the

used Internet 2-3 times a week and an equal percentage
(26.7 per cent) of the academic community used it daily
and once in a month, respectively. The analysis clearly
indicates that on an average majority of the respondents
used Internet once in a week.
Access to and availability of personal computers
(PCs) influenced the use of Internet. The respondents
from the different institutions under study were not
having common access point on campus for the use of
Internet. The computer centres provided general access
points for all the respondents, and to some extent the
libraries in these institutions also offered a limited
access. However, the students used multiple locations
to access the Internet.
From the analysis it was observed that a majority of
the respondents, i.e., 42.2 per cent accessed Internet at
their homes, 39.7 per cent at the Internet Café and 33.7
per cent library to access the Internet. Only 11.9 per
cent and 11.5 per cent used the computer laboratory on
campus and 11.5 per cent of the teachers accessed the
Internet at their departments.

6.5 Purpose of Internet Use
The Table 4 shows the different purposes for which
the respondents used the Internet. Table 4 shows that
215(79.6 per cent) of the respondents used Internet ‘to
obtain course related information’, 75.6 per cent used for
preparing their seminar and assignments, 67.8 per cent
for ‘communication’ mainly through e-mail, 47 per cent
for ‘chatting’ with their friends and relatives and almost
equal percentages (44.4 per cent, 43.7 per cent and
42.2 per cent) for ‘News and Media’, ‘Social networking’
and ‘Games and Music’, respectively. About 35.2 per
cent used it for downloading software, 28.9 per cent for
e-books and only 19.6 per cent for e-journals. It is
encouraging to note that the respondents were making
maximum use of the Internet and were aware of its
benefits for educational purposes as well as other
purposes.

6.6 Using Different Internet Services
Internet provides a number of services like e-mail,
FTP, discussion groups, BBS, WWW, etc. Table 5
shows that majority of the users used e-mail (92.2 per
cent), search services (90.7 per cent) as well as the
WWW (81.1 per cent) respectively) while about 57.8 per
cent use it for chatting and 26.7 per cent for frequently
asked questions. Very few respondents use the Internet
for BBS and discussion groups.

6.7 Problems Encountered in Using Internet
The respondents were asked to state whether they
faced any problems (constraints) while using the
Internet. It was observed that, 76.3 per cent encountered
difficulties while using Internet. In continuation of the
query on whether they faced any problems in the use of
the Internet, a list of nine problems was enumerated and
the respondents were asked to record their level of
barriers on a ‘five-point scale’.
Mean value along with the standard deviation
obtained for each of the barrier was calculated and given
in the Table 6 in the descending order of the value.

‘Slow Internet access speed’ was indicated as the
most severe barrier faced by the respondents (mean
value: 3.50) followed by ‘too long to view/download’
(mean value: 3.46). ‘electricity failure’, ‘difficulty in
finding relevant information’, and ‘limited number of
computers’ were all rated above the midpoint (2.5) of the
scale reflecting other major problems while using the
Internet.

6.8 Need for Improving Skills Using Internet
Further the respondents were asked to respond if
they would like to improve their skills in the use of the
Internet. Vast majority (90.45 per cent) of the
respondents expressed their willingness to improve their
skills in the use of the Internet.

6.9 Satisfaction with the Internet Facilities
Provided by the Institution
When the respondents were queried regarding their
satisfaction with the Internet facilities provided in their
institutions, 47.8 per cent i.e. nearly half of the
respondents opined that they were partially satisfied
while 18.1 per cent were least satisfied. Only 16.7 per
cent were fully satisfied with the Internet facilities
provided in their institutions.

7. CONCLUSIONS
Based on the findings of the study, the following
suggestions are recommended to improve the use of
Internet among the teachers and the undergraduate
students of the Mangalore city colleges:

required in the library as well as the computer
centre.



To solve the slow downloading problem, the
colleges should acquire high speed Internet
connection with maximum bandwidth.



Information regarding the popular and the latest
websites with their addresses should be displayed
on the notice board in the library and in the
computer centre.



Printing facility should be provided so that the users
can get printout of their study materials and other
important documents.



The Internet facility should be familiarised to all.
