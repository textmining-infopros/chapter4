ABSTRACT
Application of information and communication technologies in academic institutions in West Bengal
has increased in the recent years. But the computerisation work of general degree college libraries of
Burdwan Sadar (North and South) is very slow due to certain problems. Trained manpower is one of the
major problems. This paper examines the situation of IT application and related manpower problems in
government-aided general degree college libraries of Burdwan Sadar (North and South), West Bengal.
Keywords: ICT, cyberian, hybrid library, college library, human resource, manpower problem in college libraries

1. INTRODUCTION
An ideal college library with the advancement of
information technology is becoming a hybrid library, a
digital library or a virtual library. The future librarian may
be designated as cyberian or cyber librarian, as he has
to provide information service from a large number of
documents published in digital form and available through
Internet where a significant number of documents are
available free of cost. It may not be far away when a
large number of students will demand computerised
service from a college library. So, libraries may think to
reorient their activities with the help of information and
communication technologies (ICT).
This has become essential for many reasons: for
improved control over collections, for increased volume
of library activities or workload, for improved control over
operations, for improved quality services to users, user
friendliness, regularity, etc., as also to prevent
duplication of efforts, for cooperation and shared
utilisation of information. Although IT application in
college libraries is no doubt a boon, its implementation is
a most challenging job, especially in government-aided
general degree colleges in West Bengal as they face lot
of constraints like shortage of manpower, lack of proper
training, and personnel motivation.
Received on 27 January 2010

This paper discusses several questions like, what is
the present state of IT application in the college libraries
at Burdwan Sadar, West Bengal; what kinds of problem
do these libraries face; availability of skilled manpower,
future plan of the libraries, etc.

2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The objectives of the study are:


The history of efforts in automating libraries in
government-aided general degree colleges of
Burdwan Sadar (North and South).



The infrastructure available in the libraries for
smooth computerisation.



The areas of work automated/being automated.



The automated services being provided by the
libraries.



The problems faced by the staff during the process
of automation.



The mode of acquiring IT skills by the staff.



The manpower problem faced by the libraries and
how to overcome it.

3. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
A lot of work has been published in the field of library
automation. Mahapatra and Padhi1 studied the problem of
IT application in Orissa libraries. Thapa and Sahoo2 have
reported the findings of a survey studying the present
status of automation in special libraries of Jabalpur
District in Madhya Pradesh. It aimed at understanding
and analysing the various problems faced by the
authorities and the staff during the process of automation
and suggested ways and means to overcome these
problems. Lohar and Kumber3 in their study on the
present situation of college libraries in Shimoga District
(Karnataka) have concluded that the situation do not
meet the prescribed norms. Watane, Vinchurkar and
choukhande4 studied the computer literacy and use of IT
in college libraries of Amravati city covering IT
awareness of the library professionals and IT application
in libraries. Kannappanavar and Kumbargoudar5 studied
different training programmes for the library
professionals in India and concluded that most of the
present training programs are general and theoretical in
nature. Chakraborty and Maisal6 found library
automation and networking do not depend only on the
capacity of the computer or the networking server or
even the software used since they are only tools. Much
depends on the quality of manpower of the libraries and
the perfection of the work they do. Sen7 studied on
automation of a college library. According to her, entire
library automation programme requires judicious
decision making at various stages. Such decision may
be related to ‘do it’ or ‘buy it’ services, selection of
hardware and software platform, application software,
types of services to be rendered, etc. Banerjee8 studied
networking of government college libraries of West
Bengal. The findings reveal that the networking of

government college libraries are in a conceptual stage
and the idea comes to only one or two librarian. Ramesh
Babu, Vinayagamoorthy and Gopalakrishnan9 examined
the the extent and the level of ICT skills possessed by the
librarians of these institutions in their study.

4. METHODOLOGY
The addresses of the general degree colleges of
Burdwan Sadar (North and South) were collected from
the Annual Report of the University of Burdwan10.
Required data for the study was collected through survey
using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaires
were given to the librarians of the colleges personally by
hand. The data collected was further supplemented by
informal discussion with the librarians of these colleges.

5. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
5.1 Basic Information About the Colleges
Surveyed
Eight colleges under Burdwan Sadar have been
arranged chronologically by year of establishment in
Table 1. Out of the eight colleges six (75 per cent) are
evaluated by NAAC. One got B++, three B+ and two got
B grade. Five colleges (62.5 per cent) have two shifts
(Morning and Day), one college (12.5 per cent) has
three shifts and two (25 per cent) colleges have only day
shift. In Burdwan Raj College (BRC), the libraries of both
shifts are treated as separate units. Therefore, data was
collected for all the shifts.
The libraries of other colleges do not treat the
Morning/Day/Evening shifts as separate units. There was
no library system in Galasi Mahavidyalya. So, no library-

clerks or library assistants, library attendant or library
peon as per sanctions. So majority of the college
libraries were suffering from lack of permanent
professional staff.

5.2 Information About Availability of Staff

5.3 Qualification of the Library Staff

Table 2 shows that among nine libraries under study
only 4 (44 per cent) have full-time Librarian/Assistant
Librarian. In most cases, the number of existing staff was
below the number of sanctioned posts. Five (55 per cent)
college libraries were supported by contractual library
professionals. But most of the colleges had all the library

Table 3 shows that librarians had a degree in an
academic subject as well as in Library and Information
Science. One of them has a PhD also. This means there
was no lack of qualified library professionals in the
libraries. Only one librarian has a Diploma in Information
Technology Application (DITA).

5.4 Infrastructural Facilities Available in the
Libraries

5.6 Use of Computer in the Libraries
Table 6 lists the purpose of using computers in the
libraries. Almost eight (88.9 per cent) libraries were using
computers for performing some official work as well as
for housekeeping operations (cataloguing, circulation,
serial control, etc.). Only three (33.3 per cent) libraries
were using computers for providing information retrieval
service through internet.

Table 4 shows that all the libraries had computers for
computerising the library while seven (78 per cent) of
these were having printers. Only 2 (22 per cent) libraries
had Internet connection for providing online service to
the users, Four (44 per cent) libraries telephone facility
and three (33 per cent) Xerox facility. So the basic
hardware was present in most of the libraries, but LAN
facility was very limited.

5.7 History of Library Automation
Table 7 reveals that college libraries introduced
computers during 2003-2009. Most of the colleges
acquired library management software (LMS) and
started data entry work more or less in the same year of
acquiring the computers. Out of nine libraries, three were
using priced LMS SOUL, three libraries were using Free

5.5 Availability of Computers for Library Staff
and Users
Table 5 shows that number of computers available in
the libraries vary from one to four, but the users were not
allowed to use the computers in most of the cases.

computerisation work in the libraries was in the beginning
stage.

5.9 Extent of Data Automated
5.8 Areas of Library work Automated/being
Automated
Table 8 lists the areas of library operations
automated. Only one library used computer for
accounting and budgeting purpose. Almost seven (78 per
cent) libraries were performing all the office works
through computer. No library had automated the
functions of serials control.
Dr Bhupendra Nath Dutta Smriti Mahavidyalya was
the only library which performed the entire housekeeping
operations except Budgeting and Serial Control through

Table 9 shows that out of nine only 3 (33 per cent)
libraries had computerised all of their records of books.
Rest of the libraries were at various stages of progress. It
is also seen that no library had computerised the records
of periodicals. Only one library computerised all the
membership data essential for computerized circulation.

work through in-house adhoc contractual staff on
monthly wage basis. Table also shows that five libraries
gave the tender of work to the outer agency. The
automation work of four libraries was going on with the
joint efforts of in-house staff as well as through outer
agency.

5.11 Impediments in Library Automation
Library automation is an expensive, complex and
continuous process involving various constrains faced in
its implementation. To identify constraints faced by the
college libraries of Burdwan Sadar, respondents were
offered nine problems to choose. Table 11 shows
maximum libraries faced problem of financial constraints
as well as less interest of authority to upgrade IT skill of

staff. On the other hand, in a few libraries, lack of interest
of staff in learning IT applications was the problem.

5.12 Training in Computer Applications
Table 12 shows that maximum number of library
professionals acquired IT skills through self-study
followed by formal education.

6. CONCLUSION
The government-aided general degree colleges of
Burdwan Sadar, are still in the state of infancy with
regard to IT applications in libraries. Out of the nine
libraries only three had completed retro-conversion work
while work was in various stages of progress. No library

2005, 42(3), 335-53.

The professional library staff may be given ample
opportunity to work independently, so that they can prove
their worth in automating the college libraries. The
libraries had neither proper IT trained manpower, nor
were the authorities interested to make them trained by
sending them to reputed institutions. Since no
opportunity was extended to the employees by the
principals, the working library staff is languishing in their
position. To improve the standard of work of the college
libraries in terms of modernisation with specific
emphasis on IT applications, the above factors may be
taken into consideration so that the situation may improve
and the college libraries of Burdwan Sadar may provide
IT-enabled services to their students/users.
