ABSTRACT
The purpose of ontology is to achieve inter-operability by providing a common terminology and
understanding of a given domain of interest, which in turn allows for the assignment of clear meaning to
learning object. Ontologies are used in artificial intelligence, biomedical informatics, library science, chemistry
and many other subjects. The purpose of this paper is to make the library professionals alert about the
literature published on ontology and applications of ontology.
Keywords: Ontology, construction of ontology, semantic Web, literature review

1. INTRODUCTION

2. PURPOSE, SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

The socio-economic and technological developments
have been responsible for the unmanageable growth of
information and knowledge. Libraries and other similar
organisations have been entrusted to collect, organise
and make useful knowledge available without loss of time.
To serve this purpose, libraries and the other agencies
involved in the knowledge generation, have been
developing various knowledge organisation tools. These
include classification schemes, lists of subject headings,
thesauri, taxonomies, ontologies, etc.

Purpose of this paper is to review the literature
dealing with the construction and applications of ontology.
The review is restricted to the literature published up to
July 2010. The review is based on the literature reported in
LISA. Since it is based on the abstracts in the LISA, it
covers the literature published in non-English languages
also.

Ontology has been widely applied to information
retrieval, artificial intelligence, knowledge network and
knowledge management1. Ontologies ensure efficient
retrieval by enabling inferences based on domain
knowledge, which is gathered during the construction of
knowledge base2. Ontologies specifically play an
important role in supporting knowledge-based
applications in semantic web3. They are the backbone of
a semantic Web, a semantic-aware version of the World
Wide Web4. The success of the semantic Web depends
strongly on the proliferation of ontologies5. Ontologies
represent a key aspect for the integration of information
coming from different sources, for supporting
collaboration within virtual communities, for improving
information retrieval, and more generally, it is important for
reasoning on available knowledge6. Thus with the growth
of semantic web and the knowledge management
systems in the corporate world and other organisations,
ontologies will be vital tools for knowledge sharing.

3. ONTOLOGY: A DEFINITIONAL ANALYSIS
Gruber7 defined ontology as an explicit specification
of a conceptualisation. Guarino8 argued that it is not a
conceptualisation but an agreement about a
conceptualisation. While further elaborating the meaning
of ontology, Guarino9 stated that, ‘ontology is a logical
theory accounting for the intended meaning of a formal
vocabulary, i.e., its ontological commitment to a particular
conceptualisation of the world. The intended models of a
logical language using such a vocabulary are constrained
by its ontological commitment. Ontology indirectly
reflects this commitment (and the underlying
conceptualisation) by approximating these intended
models’. The characteristics of ontology are: Sharing: The
notion of ontology is to capture commonly agreed
knowledge. Conceptualisation: Refers to the mental
formulation of a phenomena in the world. It is developed
by identifying the related concepts of that phenomena.
Formal relationships: Ontology formalises the
relationships among the concepts, which makes
computer to interpret the semantic relationships among
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

the concepts and infer the implicit knowledge. Polynomial
hierarchy: It develops in a polynomial hierarchy instead a
rigid monolithic hierarchy structure.

4. CONSTRUCTION OF ONTOLOGY
Ontology construction is a complex task. It involves
various methods and use of tools such as vocabulary
lists, softwares, Web ontology language (OWL), etc. It
also involves use of principles and theories. In the
literature reviewed, it was observed that most of the
researchers are proposing the use of automatic or semiautomatic methods for the construction of ontology
because it is a time-consuming and tedious task1.
According to De Nicola, Missikoff, and Navigli4
ontology building exhibits a structural and logical
complexity that is comparable to the production of
software artifacts. Nevertheless it is useful to have
varieties of high quality ontologies for the effective use of
knowledge. Such availability depends on effective and
usable methodologies aimed at supporting the crucial
process of ontology building4.
The literature reviewed below is evident that the view
of De Nicola, et al. is supported by other researchers, as
number of ontology development methodologies have
been evolved and tested successfully. Clustering-based
method is another method useful in ontology
construction. It is suitable for the construction of cultural
ontologies for community-oriented information systems10.
This semi-automated method merges distributed
annotation techniques or subjective assessments of
similarities between cultural categories with established
clustering methods to produce “cognate” ontologies.
Another semi-automated system for ontology
construction is proposed by Lin and Hanqing5. It adopted
an approach of non-dictionary Chinese words
segmentation techniques based on N-Gram to acquire
domain candidate concepts. It takes the method based of
natural language processing in the recognition of domain
concept property relation, extracting subject, predicate
and object of sentences. This triangle data can he treated
as the triplet of data, object type and property.
Jun and Yuhua11 introduced an automatic approach
for ontology building by integrating traditional knowledge
organisation resource. It first builds a primary ontology
describing the classes and relationships involved in
bibliographic data with OWL, and then fill the primary
ontology with instances of classes and their relations
extracted from catalogue dataset and thesauri and
classification schemes used in cataloguing.
Conversion and or use of existing vocabulary tools is
one of the sub-systems adopted in ontology construction.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

Junzhi and Dandan12 suggested a method of conversion
from law FrameNet database to OWL ontology. Similarly
a procedure for modeling the semantics of Library of
Congress subject headings into ontology is described by
Papadakis13. Hua, et al. suggested a SUMO-based
emergency response preplan ontology model. This model
facilitates shared understanding for people from different
domains. It uses SUMO which is the most authoritative
common ontology as upper ontology. It analysed the
preplan-related concepts, properties and relations in
depth, extracted domain knowledge, refined norms of
professional and business glossary of terms and clearly
defined their meaning and relationship among them.
Ontology engineering and thesaurus-based ontology
construction are the two major methods for the
construction of domain ontology.
Ziyu and Lei15 proposed a construction methodology
of domain ontology that is composed of multi-disciplinary
approach based on thesaurus and thematic words of highspeed railway that is built by the experts. Ontology and
software development share a fare amount of
commonality. Considering this feature De Nicola,
Missikoff and Navigli proposed an ontology development
methodology called UPON, i.e., Unified Process for
Ontology4. This system is based on the unified software
development process or unified process (UP), which is a
widely used standard in software engineering.
Guangron16 developed a course knowledge ontology
for an e-learning course in C programming. The ontology
is constructed through drawing out the core concepts of
the course as well as the relations among the concepts.
The ontology consists of 183 concepts, 130 sub-class
relations, and 48 properties which are described in
standard OWL. Most ontology construction methods
focus on concept types.
Nguyen17 et al. presented an ontology construction
method that focused on relation types instead of concept
types. The authors formalised the concept of “predicate of
predicates” as meta-relation type and introduced the new
hierarchy of meta-relation types as part of the ontology
definition.
The new notion of closure of a relation or metarelation type is presented as a means to complete that
relation or meta-relation type by transferring extra
arguments and properties from other related types. The
end result is an expanded ontology, called the closure of
the original ontology, on which automated inference could
be more easily performed.
The domain ontology evolution approach is yet
another approach useful in constructing ontology. This
approach is adopted in construction of aviation ontology
by Yingfang and Lei18. The FCA-based ontology
85

construction method is another one. It consists of three
steps, i.e. (i) PAT-tree based phrase extraction, (ii) feature
selection, and (iii) formal context acquirement. This
method greatly improves automatic construction of
ontology and the constructed ontology by this model is
reliable1.
Jiang and Tan3 criticised that the traditional ontology
construction systems employ shallow natural language
processing techniques and focus only on concept and
taxonomic relation extraction. To overcome this lacuna,
the authors proposed a new system for mining ontologies
automatically from domain-specific documents, known as
Concept-Relation-Concept
Tuple-based
Ontology
Learning (CRCTOL).
This system: (i) adopts a full text parsing technique,
(ii) employs a combination of statistical and lexicosyntactic methods, including a statistical algorithm that
extracts key concepts from a document collection, a
word sense disambiguation algorithm that disambiguates
words in the key concepts, (iii) uses a rule-based
algorithm that extracts relations between the key
concepts, and (iv) also adopts a modified generalised
association rule mining algorithm that prunes unimportant
relations for ontology learning.
Using this method the Jiang and Tan built terrorism
domain ontology and sport-event domain ontology.

5. ONTOLOGY MATCHING FOR
INTEGRATION
Matching relevant ontology data for integration is
vitally important as the amount of ontology data increases
along with the evolving semantic Web, in which data are
published from different individuals or organisations in a
decentralised environment. For any domain that has
developed a suitable ontology, its ontology annotated
data (or simply ontology data) from different sources often
overlaps and needs to be integrated. Considering this
requirement Wang, Jie and Zhang19 proposed an
intelligent Web ontology data matching method and
framework for data integration. This method is different
from existing data matching or merging methods applied
to data warehouse in that it employs a machine learning
approach and more similarity measurements by exploring
ontology features.
To resolve ontological heterogeneities among
distributed data sources in an organisational memory and
subsequently generate a merged ontology to facilitate
resource retrieval from distributed resources for
organisational decision making, Kiu and Lee20 proposed
an automated ontology mapping and merging algorithm,
namely OntoDNA, which employs data mining techniques
(FCA, SOM, K-means).

6. USES OF ONTOLOGY
Ontologies are constructed keeping in mind specific
applications. Ontologies are concept specification
devices that help in very many areas of work. This is
substantiated by the literature reviewed below which
deals with diverse areas ranging from library and
information science, knowledge management, education,
medical science, organisation of information on the
Internet and for retrieving the same through search
engines to financial institutions. The literature in this
section is reviewed in the same sequence as mentioned
above.
Ontologies could be used by users to find their actual
and potential search requirements step by step which
depends on two methods; one is using edit distancebased method to search word in ontology base and the
other is using concept space-based method to help user
to extend keywords. The benefit of this method is that it
utilises the relations between words built by field ontology
to find word’s actual meanings in its context21. Keywordbased search in the traditional system performed poorly
when literal term matching was carried out for query
processing, due to synonymy and ambivalence of words.
According to Saravanan, Ravindran and Raman2
ontological frameworks can be used to improve this
performance. Another application of ontology in library
related activity is worked out by Liao22, et al. Liao and his
co-authors developed a novel library recommender
system for English collections by integrating personal
ontology model and collaborative filtering model with
domain
specification.
The
personal
ontology
recommender (PORE) system offers a friendly user
interface and provides several personalised services. This
system was implemented and tested in the Library of
National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan and proved
satisfactory.
As a greater volume of information becomes
increasingly available across all disciplines, many
approaches, such as document clustering and
information visualisation, have been proposed to help
users manage information easily. However, most of these
methods do not directly extract key concepts and their
semantic relationships from document corpora, which
could help better to illuminate the conceptual structures
within given information. To resolve this problem Zheng23,
et al. proposed “Clonto” approach which identifies the key
concepts, and automatically generates ontologies based
on these concepts for the purpose of conceptualisation.
LIS professionals have always shown interest in
integrating various vocabulary control tools. As such
integration brings many advantages. Zhonghua24, et al.
proposed integration of ontology into thesauri so as to
build ‘thesauri-ontology’, as a solution to building
multilingual thesauri. The MatSeek database which
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

enables federated search interface to key material
science databases and analytical tools uses MatOnto
ontology to integrate data across disparate databases
Cheung, Hunter and Drennan25.
Chen26, et al. developed information needs ontology
based on a comprehensive understanding of
personalised user information needs. For this purpose
the authors first formalised an ontology model applicable
to the ubiquitous computing environment to describe user
information needs. Second, in light of the user’s explicit
information needs, the digital library finds the hidden
information needs from the ontology knowledge base,
and also extracts the information resources required by
the user from the corresponding database and then
pushes them to the user by means of RSS feeds. Finally,
users can browse through a man-machine interface to
access the information.
Ontology with its inference mechanism is the key
technology of semantic Web. With the development of
semantic Web, ontology is widely used in many
domains. Ontology provides a brand new model of
knowledge management, which solves the problems of
knowledge organisation, knowledge retrieval and so on27.
Most users of knowledge management systems are not
knowledge management professionals as such they lack
the basic understanding of knowledge organization.
Visualisation is a better technique to show the knowledge
structure to such users.
Hui28 bring out the difference between visualisation
in knowledge management system based on ontology
molecule and in the ordinary visualisation system and
puts forward the principle of visualisation designation in
knowledge management systems based on ontology
molecule. A case study of application of ontologies in
knowledge management in Brazilian energy utility is
presented by Almeida and Barbosa29.
Benson30 explored potential of ontological principles
in the formal description of archival photographs. This
exploration was for knowing whether the photograph
archivists
need
more
formalised
system
of
representation or existing schemes are satisfactory.
Based on the exploration the author has proposed a new
semantic archives model.
Guo and Zhang31 used ontology to represent domain
knowledge for the purpose of a question-answering
system. Ubiquitous learning grid uses ubiquitous
computing environment to infer and determine the most
adaptive learning contents and procedures at anytime,
anyplace and with any device. Liao32, et al. proposed an
ontology-based ubiquitous learning grid (OULG). It helps
to resolve the difficulties concerning how to adapt
learning environment for different learners, devices,
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

places. OULG identifies and adapts the aspects of
domain, task, devices, and background information
awareness, so that the adaptive learning content could be
delivered. Ontologies could be used in the e-learning field
to model educational domains and to build, organise and
update specific learning resources33. By using
ontologies it is possible to define a description base for
scholarly events to enable software agents to crawl and
extract scholarly event data, and to facilitate unified
access to this data. The collected data may then be
mined for non-obvious knowledge. Jeong and Kim34
developed and implemented the SEDE, i.e., Scholarly
Event DEscription ontology for this purpose.
Chi and Chen35 demonstrated how the semantic
rules in conjunction with ontology can be applied for
inferring new facts to dispatch news into corresponding
departments. The system comprises finding a glossary
from electronic resources, gathering organisation
functions as controlled vocabularies, and linking
relationships between the glossary and controlled
vocabularies. Web ontology language is employed to
represent this knowledge as ontology, and semantic Web
rule language is utilised to infer implicit facts among
instances. Use of ontology in financial institutions is
demonstrated by Ye36, et al. The authors first developed
static ontology, dynamic ontology, and social ontology
and then they integrated these in the OWL and the
Semantic Web Rules Languages (SWIRL) framework,
both of which are machine readable.
E-science is increasingly being used to address
scientific problems that require cross-disciplinary
knowledge, such as climate change, natural disasters,
and environmental health. Brodaric and Probst37
integrated two ontologies so as to derive benefits from
unified disciplinary ontologies for retrieving information
on e-science. Ontologies could be used for seamless
integration of medical images and different user
applications by providing direct access to image
semantics. Semantic image retrieval provides the basis
for clinical decision support and computer-aided
diagnosis38. Ontologies could also be used to develop
first-aid knowledge question answering system39.
Ontology’s role in organising the vast stock of
knowledge on the Internet is highlighted by Gokhale40.
Traditional search engines work on the basis of wordmatch technology which results in low efficiency. This
problem could be overcome by using an intelligent
search method based on domain ontology41. Further
Aguilar-Lopez,
Lopez-Arevalo
and
Sosa-Sosa42
suggested that the relevance of search engine results
could be enhanced by filtering the contents through the
integration of domain ontologies, the WordNet thesaurus,
and a hierarchical similarity measure.
87

7. CONCLUSION
It could be seen from the above that a large number
of ontologies have been developed for diverse
applications. Many applications benefit from the use of a
suitable ontology but it could be difficult to determine
which ontology is best suited to a particular application.
To be able to select a suitable ontology, it is necessary to
evaluate them.
Though there are many criteria available such as
application, methodologies, etc. Yu, Thom and Tam43
believe the requirement should be the most important
criteria for ontology evaluation. So the authors presented
a new method named ROMEO, i.e., RequirementsOriented Methodology for Evaluating Ontologies. It
identifies requirements that the ontology must satisfy and
map these requirements to evaluation measures.
