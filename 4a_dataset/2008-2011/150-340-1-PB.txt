ABSTRACT
India needs to adopt a national Open Access self-archiving mandate for all of its
research institutions and funders. The principle is simple, it is already embodied in India’s
Law of Karma as well as in the West’s ‘Golden Rule’: ‘Self-Archive Unto Others As You
Would Have Them Self-Archive Unto You’. If India sets the example, by officially adopting
and implementing this rule, India’s own research access and impact will be maximised,
the rest of the world will follow India’s example, and research progress worldwide will
be the beneficiary.
Keywords: OA, self-archiving, S&T, citation impact, OAI, India

India is peculiarly well positioned to
help herself while helping the entire planet
as well, insofar as scientific research is
concerned (Arunachalam 2006; Suber &
Arunachalam 2005). There are Haves and
Have-Nots in every domain, and research is
no exception: Some have more access to
laboratories, equipment, grants, and research
literature, and some have much less.

Laboratories, equipment, and even research
funding are analog. They are physical resources
that are finite and unequally distributed. But
the research literature is digital; hence, both
in principle and in practice, it could be made
freely and equally accessible to one and all
(Harnad 1995). And very much hangs upon
its equal distribution, because research
productivity and progress depend critically
35

on researchers’ having full access to current
and past research findings. Those are what
current and future research is built upon,
and from (Houghton & Sheehan 2006).
About 25,000 peer-reviewed research
journals exist across all fields of science
and scholarship, the world over, in all languages
(Ulrichs Directory). They publish about 2.5
million articles a year. Access to those articles
is very unevenly distributed. There are Haves
and Have-Nots among the planet’s universities
and research institutions, but even the Haves
can only afford a fraction of the whole. Even
Harvard, the university with the largest journals
budget of all, cannot subscribe to all journals,
and most other universities have far smaller
journal budgets (ARL Statistics).
Yet the irony is that the authors of all
those articles (researchers) have always given
them away for free (Harnad 2001). Researchers
give their articles to their publishers, asking
for no fee or royalty from their sales in
return; researchers also give their articles
away for free to anyone who writes to them
requesting a reprint: In paper days this requesting
and sending was done by mail (Swales 1988);
in online days it is increasingly done by
email.
To Indian researchers, requesting reprints
by mail has always been vital, as India is
of course very much on the Have-Not end of
the world’s journal subscriptions. Requesting
and sending reprints certainly comes nowhere
near solving the problem of providing equal
access to all for all, but it has been a godsend
for some, and as a result, India is not just
a net consumer of research from the rest of
the world, but also a significant provider of
research to the rest of the world. The question
to be asked in the online age, however, is
whether emailed reprint requests are enough
to provide the research access that India
needs, and whether India’s research output
is getting all the impact it deserves. The
answer to both questions is No: India can
do far better than that (Chan, et al. 2005;
Harnad 2006a).
Research impact means research uptake,
applications and citations (Garfield 1955;
36

Harnad & Carr 2000). Researchers should
always ask themselves: to what extent are
my findings being read, used, and built upon,
in further research and research applications?
We are accustomed to thinking of the lack
of access to research as being a handicap
for the research user, but it is a handicap
for the research provider as well. Less accessible
research is also research that is failing to
achieve its full potential impact. And research
impact brings visibility, funding, new
collaborations and further research progress
(Harnad 2006b).
Yet the online age has already provided
the means to solve both the research access
problem and the research impact problem,
completely: Instead of having to mail or email
authors to request reprints of articles, one
by one, researchers can access the ‘eprint’
of the article directly, free for all (‘Open
Access’, OA), on the web—or at least they
could do so, if the 2.5 million annual articles
were all being deposited (self-archived), free
for all, on the web (Garfield 1999; Drenth
2003). The problem is that only about 15 per
cent of them are currently being self-archived
spontaneously by their authors.
OA has been demonstrated to increase
research impact dramatically (Hitchcock 2007):
the percentage increase in citations for articles
published in traditional (subscription-only)
journals that are made OA through self-archiving
by their authors (compared to articles in the
same journal and year that are not) is shown
in Fig. 1 for a number of disciplines (Harnad
& Brody, 2004; Hajjem, et al. 2005).
India spends about 170 billion rupees of
public money annually on science and technology
research. The return on this investment must
be maximised: it is the duty of research
administrators to ensure this. Let us take
the data in Fig. 1 to indicate that Open
Access increases citations to published research
on average by over 50 per cent. Since only
15 per cent of research is available on this
basis, this means that the remaining 85 per
cent stays hidden away in subscription-based
journals that only a minority of libraries can
purchase; they thus remain largely unread
and unused. That 85 per cent could be getting

far greater visibility and use if it were all
Open Access. In other words, India would
have to spend a further 70 billion rupees on
research in order to get the same uptake,
usage and impact for its research output
worldwide as it could currently get, without
spending any more money at all, by simply
making all of her research output Open Access
(Harnad 2005; Swan 2005).
For the individual researchers at India’s
universities and research institutions, the
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(1)

personal increase in visibility and impact for
their work is also there to be gained. Open
Access Institutional Repositories (Registry),
established using the free Eprints software
available, would collect and display the work
of India’s researchers to the world. Every
time a researcher has a completed manuscript
that has been peer-reviewed they deposit it
in the repository and as soon as this is
done it becomes visible and usable by all.
Authors will be able to check the number
of times an article has been downloaded
37

and read from the repository because the
software can report these figures, as well as
indicating the institutions that readers are
from. A new world of personal management
of research dissemination and monitoring
becomes possible for Indian researchers once
a repository is available to them as long as
an official institutional deposit mandate is
adopted (Registry of Open Access Repository
Material Archiving Policies).
So what is India currently doing about
Open Access? India has already made important
contributions to the growth of OA, thanks to
the efforts of its tireless advocate, Subbiah
Arunachalam (2006; Suber & Arunachalam
2005), as well as the invaluable initiatives of
Prof. N. Balakrishnan and the late T.B.
Rajashekar, who created one of India’s first
OA repositories at the Indian Institute of
Science, and did a great deal to encourage
self-archiving by IISc’s researchers ( Arunachalam
2007). Articles are self-archived into digital
repositories maintained by research-based
institutions. Open Access repositories are
either centralised subject-based depots or
are broad-based institutional depots for electronic
articles. They comply with a shared set of
standards (OAI: Open Archives Initiative) that
make them interoperable, forming in effect

a worldwide database of research. Google
and Google Scholar index Open Access
repositories so any articles in them are assured
of the best visibility. There are around 1000
Open Access repositories across the world.
India already has 24 repositories, 19 of them
institutional (ROAR). The biggest is IISc’s,
with around 7500 documents deposited to
date.
But creating archives and ‘archivangelising’
(advocating) are not enough. Researchers
the world over are still largely unaware of
the advantages of Open Access. They need
to be informed and encouraged by their employers
and funders. In several international,
interdisciplinary surveys (See Fig. 2), researchers
have indicated that they will willingly selfarchive their articles if their institutions and/
or their funders mandate it–but not if they
do not (Swan, 2005). Hence there is now a
worldwide movement toward mandating OA
self-archiving.
Most of the UK Research Councils, the
Wellcome Trust, the National Institutes of
Health, the European Research Council, the
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German
Research Council), and other funders and

Figure 2. Based on international, interdisciplinary surveys, over 90% of researchers would
comply with an OA self-archiving mandate–and the vast majority would do so willingly (Swan,
2005). (Spontaneous, unmandated self-archiving, in contrast, hovers at about 15 %).

universities now have or plan such mandatory
policies (32 mandates have been adopted
and 8 more have been proposed to date;
ROARMAP). India is well represented among
these pioneering initiatives. Two of the 14
institutional OA self-archiving mandates that
have so far adopted worldwide are Indian
(National Institute of Technology, Rourkela
and Bharathidasan University). And of the
18 funder mandates so far adopted and the
5 more proposed, worldwide, one of the proposed
mandates is from India’s National Knowledge
Commission and applies to all the research
output it funds. India has also hosted the
workshop that produced the Bangalore Policy
Statement, a draft National OA Policy for
Developing Countries (National Open Access
Policy for Developing Countries 2006).
This is already an impressive record,
but India could do so much more, so easily.
India needs to adopt a national OA selfarchiving mandate for all of its research institutions
and funders. The principle is simple (Brody
et al. 2007; Harnad 2007); it is already embodied
in India’s Law of Karma as well as in the
West’s ‘Golden Rule’: ‘Self-Archive Unto Others
As You Would Have Them Self-Archive Unto
You’ (Harnad 2003). If India sets the example,
by officially adopting and implementing this
rule, India’s own research access and impact
will be maximised, the rest of the world will
follow India’s example, and research progress
worldwide will be the beneficiary.
