ABSTRACT
The study is a bibliometric analysis of remarkable contributions of Prof. G.N. Ramachandran (popularly
known as GNR), an eminent biophysicst and crystallographer. It is necessary to review the contributions made
by renowned Indian scientists so as to understand the nature and magnitudes of their contributions to a
particular field of study. The paper examines the contributions of GNR in the fields of biophysics and
crystallography, magnitude of his collaborations, and year-wise distribution of his productivity.
Keywords: Scientometrics, Bio-scientrometrics, collaboration coefficient, GNR productivity ratio, GNR- Biophysics

1. INTRODUCTION
Research is an important aspect for the
development of a nation. The research output of a nation
is a yardstick to measure its socio-economic and
educational status. There are a number of ways to
measure the quantity and quality of the research output
of the country and even the contributions of an individual.
The measurement in the field of library and information
science (LIS) is known as bibliometric analysis. It is
interesting to note that during the last few years,
bibliometric analysis has been increasingly used to
evaluate the research performance of the scientists and
the growth of various disciplines of science. The
analysis has also been used to evaluate the research
output of many leading scientists of world reputations.
Before this, it is important to understand the meaning of
bibliometrics. Some of the popular definitions of
bibliometrics are:
Pritchard1 coined the term ‘bibliometrics’ and
defined it as “The application of mathematical and
statistical methods to books and other media of
communication”. Fairthorne2 defined bibliometric as:
“The quantitative treatment of the properties of recorded
discourse and behaviour pertaining to it”.
The British Standard Glossary of Documentation of
Terms3 explained bibliometrics as ” the study of the use

of documents and patterns of publication in which
mathematical and statistical methods have been
applied.”
This is basically similar to Pritchard’s definition.
Instead of the term bibliometry, the Russians, in late
sixties, used the term scientometry and since than the
terms like Librametrics, Bibliometrics, Informetrics, and
Scientometrics have been used synonymously to study
the growth of literature in a discipline, and other aspects
of literature quantitatively. But scientometirc analysis is
confined to quantitative aspects of science and
technology disciplines. Further, scientometric could be
used for identification of emerging research areas.
Scientometric analysis throws light on the pattern of
growth of individual to the respective science and
technology subject, inter-relationship among different
branches of knowledge, productivity, authorship pattern,
degree of collaboration, pattern of collection building,
and their use.
Sengupta4 viewed scientometric as “Organisation,
classification and quantitative evaluation of publication
patterns of all macro and micro communications along
with their authorship by mathematical and statistical
calculus.”
Broadus5 presented a historical overview of various
definitions of scientometric and proposed an alternate
3

definition. According to him, “Scientometric is the
quantitative study of physical published units or of
bibliographic units or of surrogates of either.” Besides,
scientometric analysis aims to integrate the cognitive or
intellectual structure of research with a view to appraise
the relations among the authors, institutions, journal
articles, and as a means of assisting the peer-review
procedure. This study aims to apply the scientometric
analysis of the literature output of Indian biophysicst and
crystallography Legend Prof. GNRamachandran as a
tribute to him as well as to focus on the meticulous and
commendable works done by the great Indian genius
when the Indian research infrastructure was at infantile
stage.

2. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF
PROF. RAMACHANDRAN
Prof. G.N. Ramachandran (‘G’ stands for
Gopalasamudram, his native town, and ‘N’ stands for
Narayana Iyer, the name of his father) was born on
8 October 1922 in a small town near Cochin, Kerala6-7.
His father was a Professor of Mathematics at a local
college. He was a meritorious student during his under
and postgraduation. His academic thirst was induced by
the legendary Sir C.V. Raman when he joined as a
student of Physics under him (Raman) and eventually
became his most distinguished student. At Indian
Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, he first submitted
thesis entitled, ‘Optics of Heterogeneous Media’ for his
MSc degree and later a doctoral thesis in 1947, which
contained some of the earliest applications of x-ray
diffraction for the study of crystal perfection. He spent
two years in Cambridge, obtained a PhD degree working
with W.A. Wooster and returned to Bengaluru in 1949 to
began an independent career as Assistant Professor of
Physics, working in the x-ray diffraction laboratory. He
did not stay there long and moved to the prestigious
south Indian university, University of Madras, which is
also known as mother of almost all south Indian
universities.
Madras University beckoned him Professorship and
the responsibility to head the Department of Physics.
When Ramachandran moved to Madras, he was just 30.
At Madras, he flourished under the benign and
supportive influence of an enlightened Vice-Chancellor,
A. Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar. In 1954 and 1955, the
triple helix structure and Ramachandran plot and
collagen structure were published in two papers in
Nature, introducing the coil concept, a fundamental
advance in the understanding of polypeptide structures.
This was undoubtedly Ramachandran’s finest
contribution to structural biology. Ramachandran later
introduced Biophysics and crystallography in the
University of Madras. Ramachandran, along with his
colleagues, published series of research articles, both in
4

reputed national and international journals. One such
article laid the foundation for the conformational analysis
of polypeptide chains. This seminal paper circumspectly
titled
‘Stereochemistry
of
polypeptide
chain
configurations’ was published in the Journal of Molecular
Biology in 1963, and introduced the famous twodimensional map, which was called Ramachandran
Map. This map was fundamental research output and is
still used by students of biochemistry and biophysics.
During the period of 1960 and 1970, he published a
number of articles, which addressed key issues in the
structural chemistry of proteins and peptides; chain
reversals, cis-peptide bonds, hydrogen bonding, nonplanar amide distortions, and novel helices in polypeptides with alternating L and D-residues. Many of his
research works were on polypeptide stereochemistry. He
also published a book titled, ‘Fourier Methods in
Crystallography’ on x-ray crystallography and Fourier
methods. Ramachandran’s paper titled, ‘A new method
for the structure analysis of non-centrosymmetric
crystals’ promoted the use of anomalous scattering for
solving the crystallographic phase problem. In 1971,
Ramachandran, together with Lakshminarayanan,
published a key paper on three-dimensional image
reconstruction, which later had important applications in
computer-assisted tomography. Ramachandran was the
editor of Current Science from 1950 to 1957. In this
reputed journal, he published several excellent papers,
notably his work on the x-ray topographs of diamond
and anomalous dispersion. In 1990, to show tribute to
GNR, Current Science highlighted his contributions to
polypeptide stereochemistry in a special issue. For his
outstanding contributions, Prof. Ramachandran was
awarded Ewald Prize of the International Union of
Crystallography.
Professor Ramachandran organised two notable
International Conferences on Molecular Biology and
Biophysics in 1963 and 1968, which were attended by
some of the most famous names like Linus Pauling,
Severo Ochoa, Maurice Wilkins, Stanford Moore, David
Phillips, Ephraim Katchalski, Harold Scheraga, Paul
Flory, Elkan Blout, and John Schellman. following the
footsteps of his mentor C.V. Raman. Following the
footsteps of his mentor C.V. Raman, he did all his
research work in India only. Prof. Ramachandran set up
the Molecular Biophysics Unit at IISc in 1971. During
1971 and 1979, Ramachandran fashioned a new
department, which has now grown into a major centre of
Structural Biology. He was an extraordinarily gifted
individual, but he spent his last years in trouble. A stroke
and the steady onset of Parkinson disease greatly
reduced his movements and activities. Since August
1999, he was under nursing care in a hospital in
Chennai until his death due to cardiac arrest in early
April 2001.

3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY




To examine the contributions of Prof. G.N.
Ramachandran in the field of biophysics and
crystallography.
To measure and compare the growth rate of his
research contributions.



To analyse the authorship patterns of his research
contributions.



To examine the extent of collaborative research he
made with other eminent scientists.



To study the year-wise distribution of his research
productivity during his active research life.

4. LIMITATIONS
This study is confined to the list of publications
provided in his curriculum vitae on the Internet under the
name of Prof. G.N. Ramachandran. It is hoped that we
have focused his entire research output.

5. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

collaborated with one or two colleagues and published
246 papers during 1976-1994.

6. METHODOLOGY
6.1 Data Collection
The information was mainly collected from the
curriculum vitae of Prof. Ramachandran, which included
the list of his publications from web resources and the
data available in the University of Madras. Besides,
information in his biographical details appeared in the
peer-reviewed journals like Current Science and Nature,
was also considered.

6.2 Data Analysis
For analysis, Fox Pro database software was used
to classify and quantify the extracted data from web
resources. In addition to the frequency distribution and
percentage analyses, the following statistical tools and
bibliometric indicators were employed during analysis
and interpretation of data. For analysis of data, the
following methods given by Lancaster6, Leydesdroff7,
Kalyane8 Sen and Gan13, were used:

Though there are countless number of articles
available on scientometrics, a review of closely related
literature is presented. Kalyane and Devarai8 studied the
works of C.S. Venkata Ram, which revealed solo
research authorship pattern.

Kalyane and Samanta9 have done a scientometrics
study of articles published by K. Ramaiah, an
agricultural scientist from India, which throws light on
history of science, scientific development, interaction
within a research group and organisation of reseaerch
systems. While some contributions are based on solo
research, many represent multiple authorship.

Another study by Kalyane and Sen10 reflects the
contributions by Nobel laureate Pierre-Gilles de Gennes
published during 1956-1995, which reveals that
scattering of publications did not follow Bradford’s Law,
but assumptions formed about author’s productivity were
to be more or less correct. The honours and awards
received by scientists tend to attract more collaborators
and increase the productivity of the awarded scientists.
Kulkarni11 analysed the works of M.V. Bhole, a
pioneer on Yoga, who contributed 147 articles during
1965-1995. The study revealed that about 60 per cent of
his contributions were based on collaborative research
and did not confined to one type of research.
A similar study was conducted by Vijay Kumar,
Kalyane, and Kademani12 on the publications of Ahmed
Hassan Zewail, Nobel laureate in Chemistry, who had
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(6)

7. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
7.1 Contributions of Prof. Ramachandran
From the available resources it was found that
Prof. Ramachandran published 304 publications during
his life time. Among these publications, the journal
articles constituted more than 60 per cent (184) followed
by mathematical philosophy reports (77) that constituted
25 per cent of his publications. Remaining were book
articles (21), conference and symposium articles (9),
one book, seven edited books, and five monographs and
reviews. Thus, altogether he contributed 214 articles in
the field of biophysics and crystallography.

7.2 Authorship Pattern of the Articles
Based on his 214 published articles, further
evaluations were made to know the percentage of
articles he published in individual capacity and in
5

collaboration. It was found that 35.51 per cent (76
articles) were contributed in his individual capacity, 108
articles (50.46 per cent) with one joint author, and
21(9.81 per cent) with three joint authors. Thus, nearly
64.49 per cent of his contributions were of collaborative
nature. Besides, four per cent of his articles were with
four and more authors. This analysis reveals that
collaborative research predominated Prof. Ramachandran
contributions (Table 1). The ratio of collaboration is
1:1.51, which indicates that the collaborative output is
dominant over his individual output.

7.3 Collaboration Coefficient
To analyse the pattern of co-authorship, the
contributions of GNR, among Indian and foreign authors
were divided into single, two, and more than two authors
for each country. The patterns of co-authorship among
Indian and foreign authors have been examined using
Collaborative Coefficient (CC) suggested by Ajiferuke.
Accordingly, the CC has been calculated as:
CC = 1- [Σ(1/j)Fj/N]

and seminars (9) during the 48 years of his productive
life. The productivity age, chronological age, and
publication details are given in Table 3. His productivity
age began in 1942 at his chronological age of 20 years.
He has published highest number of research papers
(13) during 1963 and 12 research papers each in 1965
and 1966 at the productivity age of 22, 24, and 25 years
and chronological age of 41, 43, and 44, respectively. It
can be seen that his productive interest continued even
after his superannuating. At the productivity age of 22
and chorological age of 41, he attained 50 percentile
age.
The productivity coefficient has been calculated
using the formula
Chronological age of last publication

Pc =

Chronological age of fifty percentage

The productive coefficient of Prof. Ramachandran is
1.0:1.7.

7.6 Peak Productivity Age

where
Fj = the number of authored papers; N = total number of
research published; and j = the greatest number of
authors per paper. The CC for Prof. Ramachandran is
0.48, which is less than 0.50. The dearth of collaboration
is comparatively less with foreign authors and more with
Indian authors.

The contributions of Prof. Ramachandran are
grouped into five blocked years and each block year
comprises 10 years of chronological age as well as
productivity age (Table 4). It shows that the peak
productivity age of Prof. GNR lies between 21-30 and 4049 in chronological age.

7.7 Average Yearly Contribution

7.4 Year-wise Frequency of Publications
The year-wise distribution of Prof. Ramachandran
contribution is shown in Table 2. He made contributions
throughout his life, except in 1977, 1983-85, 1987, and
1989.

7.5 Productive Life
Prof. Ramachandran published 214 research papers
in the Journals (124); books (21), and in conferences

During the productive age, Prof. Ramachandran’s
average yearly contribution has been calculated using
the formula
T otal contribution
Ayc =
T otal productivity age
Ayc of Prof. Ramachandran is 4.458. The result
shows that on an average he contributed 4 to 5 papers
in a year during 1942 to 1990.

collaboration with various scientists (Table 5). Table 5
shows that he collaborated with Prof. R. Srinivasan for
13 papers and with R. Chandrasekhar, A.V. Lakshmi
Narayanan, and V. Sasisekaran for 11 papers each. He
also collaborated with foreign scientists, namely, J.T.
Edsall; P.J. Flory; J.C. Kendrew; A.M. Liquori; W.A.
Wooster, etc. Prof. Ramachandran made 304
contributions during 1942-1990. Out of 304 publications,
the journal articles constitute 61 per cent (184 articles)
followed by mathematical philosophy reports (25 per
cent).

8. MAJOR FINDINGS

9. DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
The present study of research productivity of
Prof. Ramachandran. offers avenues for further research
in the following areas:


It will be interesting to examine the extent and
pattern of collaborative research by other renowned
scientists in other domains.



It will also be interesting to compare the findings of
this study with experts of other branches of
science.



It will be significant to study the citation pattern of
Prof. Ramachandran’s research contributions.



It is also possible to examine intensively the nature
and patterns of research collaboration with a view to
ascertain the impact of factors such as location of
the authors, their affiliations, specialisations,
experience, age, etc.

10. CONCLUSION

During his brilliant and illustrious academic career, the
number of awards, medals and citations conferred on
him are numerous to be listed. As a man who breathed
science, and in terms of his lasting contributions to
structural biology, Ramachandran belonged to the same
intellectual class as Srinivasa Ramanujan in
mathematics, and Subrahmanya Chandrasekhar in
astrophysics.
Ramachandran’s death was a grievous loss not only
to his family members but also to the Indian and
international scientific community. His scientific
contributions will remain as monumental as his superb
intellect. The authors dedicate this paper to the
memories of Prof. Ramachandran, the protagonist of
Indian science research.
