ABSTRACT
This research is a report of the findings of a study of the information seeking behaviour of agricultural
scientists working in the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) institutions of Delhi, and Punjab
Agricultural University, Ludhiana. A structured questionnaire was developed to explore the information
seeking behaviour of agricultural scientists. Data collected were analysed using the latest version of
MS-Excel for appropriate statistical procedures for description (frequencies, per cent, means, and standard
deviations), etc. The paper discusses the findings of various strategies and procedures adopted by the
agricultural scientists in meeting their information requirement. The agricultural scientists were asked to
rank the information sources indicating their order of priority while seeking information. They were asked
to use a scale in order to their priority on the basis of I, II and III. The results show that agricultural
scientists have expressed great dependence in meeting their information requirement on their institutional
library/information centre. Seventy-two per cent of the respondents for all categories of agricultural
scientists preferred their library/information centre as the most preferred source. For accessing information
agricultural scientists highly depend on the library collection, followed by the personal collection, collection
of their supervisor and of colleagues in order of decreasing priority.
Keywords: Information seeking behaviour, ICAR, agricultural scientists, Punjab agricultural university.

1. INTRODUCTION
Information is a key issue in the information
age. The real challenge of this time is not producing
information or storing information, but getting people
to use information appropriately. Information is a
critical resource in the operation and management
of organisations. Timely availability of relevant information
is vital for effective performance of managerial functions
such as planning, organising, leading, and controlling1 .
A well-established and well-designed information
Received on 14 August 2007

system to facilitate decision making in various agricultural
development projects is critical to the success of
any organisation. To be successful, any project
requires efficient management of human and material
resources. This cannot be done unless accurate,
timely, and relevant information is available to decision
makers 2 .
There is a universal assumption that man was
born innocent or ignorant and should actively seek
knowledge. Information behaviour is a broad term
37

encompassing the ways individuals articulate their
information needs, seek, evaluate, select, and use
information. “Information seeking is thus a natural
and necessary mechanism of human existence” 3 .
Information seeking behaviour is the purposive seeking
for information as a consequence of a need to
satisfy some goal. In the course of seeking, the
individual may interact with manual information systems
(such as a newspaper or a library), or with computerbased systems (such as the Web) 4 .
Knowledge about the information-seeking behaviour
and information use of individuals is crucial for
effectively meeting their information needs. This
knowledge may also lead to the discovery of novel
information behaviour and user profiles that can be
used to enhance existing information models or
even develop new ones. Moreover, for librarians
and other information professionals to be effective
information providers, they require a fuller understanding
of the information-seeking behaviour, needs, and
uses of individuals. Wilson 5 noted that the study
of information-seeking behaviour can stand on its
own as an area of applied research where the
motive for investing is pragmatically related to system
design and development. A different motivation is
involved if we wish to understand why the information
seeker behaves as he does. This is an area of
basic research and although the resulting knowledge
may have practical applications, there is no necessity
that it should. Therefore, what, when, and how
information is gathered and used by agricultural
scientists is of critical importance to meet their
information needs 6 .

2. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
The main objective and purpose of this study was to
explore information seeking behaviour of agricultural
scientists working in the select ICAR institutions of Delhi
and Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. The specific
objectives of this study were:
(i)

To identify the purpose of seeking information,
nature and types of information required by
agricultural scientists

(ii) To examine the information seeking strategies
of the agricultural scientists
(iii) To find the effectiveness of existing information
systems and services in the field of agricultural
sciences and the extent to which they meet
the information requirement of agricultural scientists
(iv) To identify, the information sources and types
38

of publications used by the agricultural scientists
with particular reference to secondary and tertiary
sources and
(v) To identify the problems faced by the agricultural
scientists while gathering information and to
provide appropriate suggestions to overcome
them.

3. METHODOLOGY AND SCOPE
A structured questionnaire was developed for
the purpose of data collection and distributed personally
and through mail/e-mail among the agricultural scientists
in selected ICAR institutions. A total of 700 questionnaires
were distributed, out of which 375 questionnaires
were received back (53.57 per cent). The questionnaire
covered five basic areas in addition to their personal
data namely, user’s characteristics (such as age,
sex, levels of education, field of specialization,
institution affiliation and purpose of current research),
strategies of seeking information, Use of the libraries/
information centers, and Suggestions for the improvement
of the information centres/systems. The data collected
were analysed using the latest version of MS-Excel
for appropriate statistical procedures for description
of frequencies, percentage, means, and standard
deviations, etc. Three-point scale and five-point scale
were developed. Likert scale, which ranged from
0 (not important) to 4 (extremely important), was
used.
The population of the study mainly comprised
agricultural scientists working in the six institutions
of ICAR, namely, Indian Council of Agricultural Research
Hqrs, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI),
Indian Agricultural Statistical Research Institute
(IASRI), National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resource
(NBPGR), National Center for Agricultural Policy
and Research (NCAP) and Punjab Agricultural University
(PAU), Ludhiana. The term ‘agricultural scientists’
includes the teachers as well as research scientists
of various levels (i.e. Principal Scientists, Senior
Scientists, Scientists, Professors, Associate Professors,
and Assistant Professors) taken from the various
fields of agricultural sciences and their allied areas
namely, Plant Genetics and Plant Breeding, Horticulture,
Floriculture, Vegetable Science, Seed Science and
Technology, Plant Biotechnology, Agronomy, Soil
Sciences, Agricultural Physics, Microbiology,
Environmental Sciences, Agricultural Engineering,
Water Management and Technology, Plant Pathology,
Entomology, Agricultural Chemicals, Integrated Pest
Management, Biochemistry, Plant Physiology,
Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Extension, Rural
Sociology, and Computer Science.

4. FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION
4.1 Preference of Source
A number of possible sources of agricultural
information were identified and considered potentially
relevant to help agricultural scientists in meeting
their information requirements. The preferences of
agricultural scientists for information sources and
their accessibility have been conceptualised in terms
of information seeking strategies in which they first
access the most preferred sources, followed by
other sources if the problem remains unsolved. It
was found from the study that agricultural scientists
have expressed great dependence in meeting their
information requirement on their institutional libraries/
information centre. Library/information centre is the
most preferred source for 72.05 per cent of the
respondents for all categories of agricultural scientists
with a mean ranked from 2.85 to 2.27. The ‘review
articles in periodicals’ were ranked first priority by
51.34 per cent of the respondents and it occupied
second position in the rank order. ‘Discussion with
colleagues’ within the organisation was the third
preferred source of information. Out of 332 respondents
of this source, 39.46 per cent gave it first priority
whereas 38.55 per cent and 21.89 per cent responded
for second and third priority, respectively.
Agricultural scientists of categories III and IV
use this channel of information more than agricultural
scientists of categories II and I. Verbal communication
with colleagues helps in finding the solution of
problems related to agricultural. So far as the opinion
in respect of the priority in the use of ‘indexing
journals’ is concerned, 42.42 per cent of the respondents
gave first priority to this source. All categories of
agricultural scientists use indexing journals and
this source ranked fourth in order of priority. The
uses of indexing journals by different categories of
respondents were examined in order to find out any
significant difference among the various categories
of agricultural scientists. It was found that agricultural
scientists belonging to categories of II and I preferred
the use of indexing journals more than other categories
of agricultural scientists. Discussions with ‘experts
in the field’ fall fifth; 32.80 per cent of the respondents
marked it their first priority followed by 25.80 per
cent and 41.60 per cent for II and III priority, respectively.
The source ‘consult bibliography ’ as a source of
information falls sixth in the rank order. It is found
that this information source was the first priority for
28.06 per cent of the respondents followed by 36.78
per cent and 35.18 per cent as second and third
priority, respectively. The respondents of category I
use this information source more than the other
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(3)

categories of agricultural scientists. ‘Librarian/Reference
staff’ of the Library as source of information indicates
that only 25.10 per cent gave first priority to this
channel of information followed by 29.41 per cent
and 45.49 per cent for second and third priority,
respectively. ‘Library catalogue’ does not appear to
be a popular source. Only 21.27 per cent gave it
a first priority, 29.41 per cent second priority, and
49.32 per cent third priority. The agricultural scientists
of category IV used this source more (Mean 2.13)
than other categories of agricultural scientists. ‘Supervisor
as a channel’ of information found that 21.87 per
cent of the respondents marked first priority, followed
by 32.94 per cent and 45.09 per cent for second
and third priority, respectively. As seen in Table 1
agricultural scientists in category III and IV use this
source more than other categories of agricultural
scientists. Further, the other sources of information
such as abstracting journals, book sellers/publishers
catalogue and colleagues elsewhere found least
significance. Table 2 shows the priority in the use
of information sources.

4.2 Information Collection Strategies
A table of questions was asked to find out the
extent of dependence of agricultural scientists on
different modes of collecting of information. Table
3 shows their dependence on different modes for
collection of information. The weighted index of
their responses was calculated on the five-point
scale. Table 3 shows that while own efforts gets the
highest rank by the agricultural scientists as a
mode of collecting information, the supervisor is
ranked at second place. The agricultural scientists
heavily rely on computerised information search
facility. This indicates that they are more familiar
and comfortable with the computerised information
search facility and find it more reliable. Librarian,
library staff, colleagues and full-time research assistant
rank rather low. This indicates that extent of dependence
for collection of information is low in case of librarian
and library staff. Thus, they are not actively involved
in the process of information search. Part-time research
assistant were given the lowest priority among the
agricultural scientists and received eighth rank.

4.3 Strategies for Checking the References
Table 4 shows the extent of dependence on
different sources for checking of references by the
agricultural scientists on their own effort gets the
first rank. Checking, original documents and reference
sources were placed second and third, respectively
by the agricultural scientists. The other high-ranking
order was given to library catalogue, which was

placed, fourth by the respondents. Dependence on
supervisor was ranked fifth. Experts in the field and
colleagues were ranked sixth and seventh, respectively
by the respondents. Both the modes ranked librarian
and research assistant identically, putting them in
eight and ninth place, respectively. The agricultural
40

scientists cited various reasons during the course
of interview. While some of them expressed apprehensions
about the authenticity and relevance of the information
collected by the research assistants. However, in
actual practice checking of references of reference
work is hardly used by the agricultural scientists.

4.4 Strategies for Accessing Information
Accessing information is a method or approach
by which a document or any means of storing
information may be found. This method basically
depends on library collection, personal collection
of the supervisor, and personal collection of the
colleagues. The dependence of the agricultural scientists
on the listed sources and documents for accessing
information is shown in the Table 5. The ranking
shows that they highly depend on the library collection,
followed by the personal collection, collection of
their supervisor and of colleagues in order of decreasing
priority. As given in the Table 5 the library collection
emerges as the most important channel for accessing
sources of information. However, it needs to be
pointed out that own institute/university library is
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(3)

the most sought source of information to the all
categories of agricultural scientists. However, few
of them depended on some other libraries such as
IARI, NISCAIR, FRI, ICAR HQrs, Planning Commission,
CSIR HQrs, and DESIDOC.

4.5 Purpose and Need of Information
Sources
A scientist’s need of information, whether from
print or other sources, arises due to three different
reasons. The first of these is the need to know what
other scientists have recently done or are doing.
This need to keep up-to-date with the current progress
is called the current approach. The second need
arises during the course of work—a need for some
specific piece of information. This need, directly
41

Table 5. Extent of dependence on sources for accessing information
Extent of Dependence

Sources

connected with the research work or problem at
hand, is called everyday approach. And the third
need comes less often but is equally important.
This is the need to find and check, through the
relevant information system on a given subject for
background information when the scientists starts
work on a flew investigation. This requirement can
be called the exhaustive approach.
The agricultural scientists make use of a variety
of information sources while seeking information for
different purposes. Table 6 shows that a range of
sources is used for obtaining specific information,
keeping up-to-date and acquiring background information.
The successive tables enumerate the sources of
information in the order of importance for each
purpose separately.

(53.6 per cent); bibliographies/library catalogues
(52 per cent); and library acquisition lists (50.4 per
cent). The least-used source for obtaining specific
information was dissertations/theses.
The reasons for the low usage of this source
can be non-availability, lack of direct access and
lack of proper dissemination of these in the libraries
of the institutions concerned.

4.5.2 Keeping Up-To-Date
For keeping up-to-date, journals were reported
to be the most used source by 83.2 per cent of the
respondents and were ranked first (Table 8). In
addition, there are seven more sources, namely,
attending lectures, conferences, seminars, etc. (77.6
per cent); books, monographs, etc. (72.8 per cent);
yearbooks/annual reviews/advances in, etc. (71.2

seminar and conference proceedings (81.8 per cent);
conversation with colleagues and experts (60.8 per
cent); research reports (59.2 per cent), which are
referred to by more than 50 per cent of the respondents
while looking for current information and rank second
to seventh in the rank order.

4.5.3 Background Information
For background information, books monographs,
etc. were identified to be the most used source by
80.8 per cent respondents and were ranked first
(Table 9). Scientific journals are next in the order
of rank (50.4 per cent) followed by conversation
with colleagues and experts (47.2 per cent); yearbooks/
annual reviews, etc. (46.4 per cent); technical/research
reports (42.4 per cent); and references found while
reading literature (40.8 per cent). Agricultural scientists
selected sources and used them in the order consistent
with stages in the innovation decision-making process.
Printed material was used at the awareness or
knowledge stage to review background material
concerning the basics of a problem. Interpersonal
contacts with colleagues were used at the analysis,
hypothesis and persuasion stage in which researchers
tested their results by comparing them with some
standards of quality practice. Formal educational
activities were used at the decision-making and
confirmation stage to provide the most current information
on a topic.

5. CONCLUSION
The study indicates that the agricultural scientists
are much diversified in the information they seek,
the sources they access and the use they make
of the information. It is difficult to maintain support
for the idea of a single mode of formal information
channel. However, the scientific journals have been
ranked first for obtaining specific information and
keeping up-to-date. It has been ranked, second
with regard to acquiring background information.
The preferences agricultural scientists have for these
sources varied with characteristics of the individual
agricultural scientist, nature of information needed,
personal knowledge of sources and their accessibility.
The most frequently used sources were those with
good physical, functional, and intellectual accessibility.
The users tend to use these information sources,
which are personally known to them and also easily
accessible, regardless of the quality of information.
Information may be sought for a particular purpose
in particular circumstances, or collected in advance
because it is likely to be useful. It is of maximum
use when it matches a need, which is highly specific.
Thus, in view of above, it may be concluded that
the working culture of the individual needing information,
the importance placed on getting it, the facilities
available for seeking it, the knowledge about these
facilities, the judgment of their value, the probability
of getting what is wanted, all of these factors may
affect information seeking behaviour.
