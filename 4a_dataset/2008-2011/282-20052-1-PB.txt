ABSTRACT
Computer infrastructure plays a critical role in the academic system for meeting teaching, learning and
research needs. Libraries are an integral part of academic system. Adequate infrastructure facilities support
academic libraries share their resources and services in an effective way. National Institute of Technology,
erstwhile regional engineering college, are prime institutions and benchmark for technical education in India
in the field of engineering, science and technology. This paper discusses the computer infrastructure facilities
available at National Institutes of Technology across India and current status of computer-based library services
offered by these institutions.
Keywords: Computer infrastructure, technical education, academic system, National Institutes of Technology

1. INTRODUCTION
The information revolution is the central phenomenon
in the contemporary world comprising information
profusion and computer technology. On one hand,
creation and diffusion of information is largely fuelled by
information profusion, on the other hand expansion of
computer technology, seen as tool, has shaped the
nature, scope, mode, and speed of information.
Information is something that has value1. In essence,
every bit of information available today is systematically
codified, customised, and modified using computing
technology. Massive production and acceleration of
information has become overwhelming. The trend of
information overload became apparent in the late 1980s
when electronic information systems became common in
organisations2. Information revolution opened new
avenues for creation, production, and deliverance of
information through various media, mode, and formats.
The information revolution determined change in
academic settings and computer infrastructure (CI)
became the supporting tool that revolutionised the
information. In fact CI became a fundamental and
developmental tool for shaping the academic system
more efficient and accessible.

Infrastructure has many means. According to Lakos,
infrastructure is: physical components (hardware and
software), various equipment, communication lines, etc.3
CI requires specialised skills and expertise to handle and
manage these effectively. Strategic investments in
computer and communication can significantly benefit
enterprises, which will have the immediate effect of
making the country more competitive4. The 1990s saw
greater use of campus communication infrastructures and
commercial communication systems to create and store
information and then to deliver it from libraries to end
users5.
Academic library is an integral part of the academic
system whose primary function is not only to provide
resources but also to serve users (students, researchers,
faculty and staff) to meet their information needs.
Eternally, the libraries are beginning to be considered in
terms of information access rather than information
housing6. Technology has changed the entire concept of
libraries from holding to access7. Today, the influence of
CI facilities on academic library system is creating
conducive environment for users to access, avail, read
and share resources, experiences, and best practice. But
the libraries often find difficulty in building CI facilities and
provide effective services due to insufficient funds,

professional expertise, and skills to handle and manage
these appropriately, though, these are basic tools to
automate library functions and provide services easily and
accurately. Besides, the users prefer to use and access
CI facilities for optimum use of library resources and
services for meeting the pre-eminent academic needs.
These services support a large community of users in
accessing large quantity of quality resources with
minimum cost in a maximum beneficial way. It reduces
time-consuming, frustrating, labour-intensive physical
work in libraries.

2. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY
National Institutes of Technology (NITs), erstwhile
Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs), are prime
institutions and benchmarks for technical education in
India in the field of engineering, science, and technology.
During the second five year plan (1956-60), a number of
industrial projects were contemplated in India. To ensure
enough supply of trained personnel to meet the demand
for these projects, the decision was taken to start RECs,
in each major state, to churn out graduates with good
engineering merits. Seventeen RECs were established
from 1959 onwards throughout the country for regional
development of technical manpower. These colleges were
set up as joint and cooperative enterprises of the Central
as well as State Governments. Subsequently, on the
recommendation of a High Powered Review Committee
and an Empowered Committee, these colleges were
granted deemed university status with professional
management structure. In 2002, the Union Ministry of
Human Resource Development, Government of India
decided to upgrade all 17 RECs as NITs. On 14 May
2003, all these 17 institutions were taken over as fullyfunded institutions of the Central Government. These
institutions are on the lines of the prestigious Indian
Institutes of Technology (IIT) in terms of student quality,
research, and placements. Later, three Government
engineering colleges (Patna, Raipur and Agartala) were
added to NIT family. Recently, an NIT Act 2007 has come
into force with effect from 15 August 2007. As per the
provision of this Act, these institutions run on nonprofitable basis and are “institutions of national
importance”. All institutions have autonomy to draft
curriculum and functioning policies. These institutions
offer degree courses at various levels—bachelors,
masters and doctorate—in various branches. Greater
infrastructure facilities have been given to these institutions
for development in teaching, learning, research, and
dissemination of information across the country.

teaching, learning, and research. In NITs, the number of
users (especially students and faculty) and their
expectations and information needs are high. For the last
five years, the student intake among NITs has increased
from 49,185 to 76,0008. The student and teacher ratio is
also steadily increasing. Students as well as faculty
prefer to use and access computer-based information
services, and demand timely information, properly
packed, and delivered. Therefore, many NIT libraries have
been ornamented with computerised systems and
kiosks. Transactions of the library have been enhanced
from man-assisting to self-service systems. Users are
able to browse and search catalogues, access
databases, perform real-time interactions, avail electronic
document deliver/inter-library loan, etc. The computerbased services have increased the efficiency and
effectiveness of these libraries, and are not only attracting
wider community of users to access, search, and retrieve
resources but also reducing cost, time, and replication
works in the libraries.
Table 1 shows, majority (90 per cent) of NIT’s libraries
prefer to provide online (e-journals) followed by open
access online journals, and e-books, etc. Around 85 per
cent of the libraries indicated that, they provide ECAT
services, CD-ROM and audio/video services frequently.
Nearly 70 per cent of libraries prefer to provide support
services (orientation programmes and training users and
staff). The provision of virtual reference, e-current
awareness, electronic/web-based document delivery,
electronic theses and dissertations, and e-publishing
services among NIT libraries are at below the average.
Apart from those services, majority of the libraries have
the facilities of accessing communication network
services. No library among the NITs across the country
provides videotext/teletext and video/teleconferencing
facilities.

3. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the study are:
To examine CI facilities available at NIT libraries.
To study the electronic equipment available at NIT
libraries.
To evaluate zone-wise performance with respect to CI
facilities.
To identify the current status of computer-based
library services offered by the NIT libraries.

libraries in India.

5. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
The present study is confined to 20 NIT libraries in
India, concerning only the library CI facilities and services.
The data received from the respondents was
authenticated and assumed to be factual. User interview/
opinions and their degree of satisfaction through user
survey would have added more value to the present study.

Adequate CI supports academic library system
largely to utilise resources, services, and facilities. In this
study, the number of computers available in the libraries of
various NITs across the country were counted. Figure 1
shows that, 10 per cent of libraries have < five computers.
One-fourth of libraries have 11-20 computers, eight (40 per
cent) libraries have 21-30 computers. Other one-fourth of
libraries have more than 31 computers.

8. CONCLUSION
Teaching, learning, and research are the main
concerns of higher education system. Academic libraries
are one of the main supports to achieve this end. To meet
this challenge, academic libraries require good CI
facilities. The study was undertaken to identify the
current state of CI facilities at NIT libraries. The study
indicates that the South zone libraries are richer than the
other zone libraries with respect to CI facilities. From the
observations, it is concluded that, many NIT libraries
could expand their infrastructure capacities to offer better
services to students, researchers, faculty, and staff.
However, the influence of CI facilities on library services
clearly indicates that further improvement is needed. NIT
libraries should put more emphasis on online (e-journals),
OPAC, CD-ROM, audio/video, communi-cation and
support services rather than virtual reference, e-current
awareness, electronic/web-based document delivery,
electronic theses and dissertations, e-publishing etc.
Further, the libraries require proper initiation, planning,
management, and expertise to build their system and
provide value-added services to users for meeting their
information needs. Future studies may be conducted in
other universities on infrastructure development in Indian
