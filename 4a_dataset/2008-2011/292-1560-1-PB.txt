ABSTRACT
This paper aims to provide an overview of the contents and design of the online English newspapers
in India. Twelve online English newspapers published daily in India were selected for the study. The study
used website content analysis to assess the contents and design of these newspapers. A checklist was
developed as the main tool for data collection and Microsoft Excel was used as the tool for data analysis.
The study shows that online English newspapers in India have a common pattern of contents, coverage, and
design. Contents availability and access to the contents are the most prevalent options in these newspapers.
Majority of the newspapers use Blog, RSS and Facebook to connect with their readers.
Keywords: Website, news sites, online newspapers, world wide web, electronic publishing

1. INTRODUCTION
The exponential growth of Internet and the increased
reliance on digital information have revolutionised online
newspaper journalism with new ways and means of
disseminating news and other products. It has put online
newspapers to the challenge of updating and providing
fresh news frequently and dramatically increased the
news consumption and usage. Compared with traditional
news media, online newspapers have remarkable
advantages including their ability to provide up-to-date
information, rapid access to a large number of
newspapers and their archives without additional
expenses, the advantages of being interactive and
paperless, the possibility to bookmark, print or save and
edit the contents of online newspapers.
Newspapers can provide online versions, that are not
mirror images of print versions, instead offer something
extra such as interactive features or information that could
not fit in print versions1. There are a number of online
newspapers on the Internet. Some of these have only
extracts and general information, while others being
complete newspapers with archives. The important
characteristics of online newspapers include hypertext,
interactivity, and multimedia. Hyperlinks enable
navigation through online newspapers and connect

readers to related contents. News published on the online
newspapers can be complemented with background
information, graphics, photographs, animations, audio
streams and video footage, sidebars, and links to eresources such as online archives, magazines, e-books,
and other online newspapers. Interactivity can be made
available on the online newspapers to make online
editions interesting. The interactivity could be achieved by
engaging readers using RSS, Blogs, polls, surveys,
opinions, comments, feedback, etc.
There has been a number of studies that assess the
contents and design of online newspapers, and news
websites. Williams and Nicholas surveyed USA and UK
online news sites and found that American newspapers
were exploiting the advantages of web information very
well2. Massey and Levy analysed 44 English-language
online newspapers from 14 Asian countries and found that
the newspapers were focused on news contents but did
not take advantages of immediacy, inter-sites
hyperlinking, or communication between readers and the
newspapers3. In a study, Dibean found that most online
newspapers had adopted innovations such as links to
related information, and consumer services such as
searchable classifieds4. Chyi and Lasorsa reported that
websites produced by larger newspapers performed
better in terms of structure, content, presentation and
17

interactive features1. Gilbert found very low readership
overlap between online newspapers and their print
counterparts5. Gao and Vaughan showed that link
analysis was a novel and useful method that journalists
and information professionals can use to gauge online
readership and potential impact of online newspapers6.
The study conducted by Ihlstrom and Henfridsson on
genre change and interdependency of online newspapers
in Scandinavia illustrated how online newspapers had
established a number of communicative practices
significant for recognising them as a distinct digital
genre7. Hashim, Hasan, and Sinnapan found that content
availability and choice was found to be the most
significant element of interactivity. They found that
majority of Australian online newspapers offered
interactive functionality for expressing opinions, blogging,
contests and polls, only one online newspaper provided
genuine interactivity gaming8. Rahman found that
contents availability and access to the contents were the
most prevalent options in the online newspapers in
Bangladesh9.

newspapers12 was used to identify the news and URLs of
the newspapers for the study. Twelve online English
newspapers (Annexure 1) published daily in India were
selected for the study. A checklist was prepared as the
main tool to assess and evaluate the contents and design
of the online newspapers. For preparing the checklist
different online newspapers were observed and the
literature, relating to the content analysis of online
newspapers and websites were consulted. The checklist
included general information about homepages, authority,
accuracy, currency, graphics, multimedia, content,
coverage, accessibility, cost, advertisement, special
features, and application of Web 2.0 technologies. All the
selected newspapers were carefully scanned and
analysed based on the checklist. The consolidated data
were presented in tabular form using Microsoft Excel for
further analysis.

There is little research that focuses specifically on the
contents and design of online newspapers in Asia.
Therefore, a need was felt to analyse the contents and
design of online English newspapers in India. This paper
gives an informative preview of the contents and design of
online English newspaper in India and will be useful for
evaluating/deploying online newspapers and news
websites.

Homepage is considered to be the most important
and often visited webpage of a website. It is the front page
at which most web features are implemented. So it is very
important that the homepage of any website should be
appealing, user-friendly and informative to the readers.
Table 1 shows that all the online newspapers have white
background with about half of these have side bar or
frame. A very few newspapers have moving text or
marquee in their homepages. The Economic Times has a
scrolling text box in the homepage.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main aim of the study was to analyse the
contents and design of the online English newspapers in
India with following specific objectives:
(i)

To evaluate the structure, style, and design of the
online English newspapers in India.

(ii) To identify the contents and coverage of the online
English newspapers in India.
(iii) To ascertain the nature of advertisements and special
features that appears in the online English
newspapers in India.
(iv) To find out the patterns of news gathering, graphics
and multimedia in the online English newspapers in
India.

3. RESEARCH DESIGN
This study was conducted using website content
analysis. The review of related studies shows that
research methods like surveys10, web server log analysis11
and link analysis6 can also be used for anlysing various
aspects of the online news sites. The website of online

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
4.1 Homepage Features

Most of the online newspapers have provided links for
contact address and copyright in their homepage. All the
newspapers have advanced search facility. Majority of the
newspapers have provision for feedback, comments,
opinion, and polls from the readers. Majority of the
newspapers provide sitemap and e-paper facilities, and
about half of these provide e-mail and sing-in facilities also
(Table 1). Even though the Times of India offers a wider
range of services to its readers, the online versions of the
Indian Express and The Hindu are most user-friendly.

4.2 Authority, Accuracy, and Currency
The authority and accuracy of information should
intelligently be ascertained. Who is the author and what is
his/her reputation, experiences, professional status,
qualifications, etc., are required to be checked. Accuracy
describes information that is factually irrefutable and
complete. It should be assessed whether the information
found on the online newspapers is accurate. Most of the
webpages are self-published and self-edited. So the
chances of inaccurate information are more. Table 2
shows that all the online newspapers are published by
authorised and well recognised professional newspaper

From the Table 2, it was observed that all the online
newspapers gave importance to the currency of their
contents and most of them have valid links except the
Mumbai Mirror. All the newspapers meet its objective of
informing the people about the daily happenings around
the world. There are separate sections for debate, forum
or opinion poll on all the online newspapers.

companies. It was found that all the online newspapers
chosen for the study met the basic requirements like
clear and comprehensive information, and the contents
followed the essential rules of grammar and
composition.Usually the currency of online newspapers
depends on the type of information it holds. Missing date
not only mean that the document probably has not been
updated recently. It can also be an indication that it was
not written by professionals.

4.3 Graphics and Multimedia
Graphics and multimedia-supported information may
attract the readers but it should not be the sole criteria for
determining the quality of online newspapers. If the audio,
video or other effects are used, then it must be appropriate
to the purpose of the source. Table 3 shows how graphics
and multimedia were used effectively by the online
newspapers. All the newspapers had photos and videos in
their sites and about half of these have flash-enabled
photos and videos gallery. All the newspapers have
separate link to the homepage. Majority of the
newspapers are flash-enabled and about half of the
newspapers provided interactive facilities such as blogs,
RSS, feedback, polls, etc. The Hindu, The Daily News
and Analysis, and The Statesman have interactive
graphics on their online versions. A very few newspapers

4.4 Contents and Coverage
The validity, uniqueness, novelty, and purpose of
information are some of the major points on which the
contents of online newspapers are to be analysed. Table 4
shows that the online English newspapers in India have a
common pattern of contents, coverage, and design.
Contents availability and access to the contents are the
most prevalent options in these newspapers. While all the
online newspapers provided editorials, most of these also

4.5 Accessibility, Advertisements, and Special
Features
The question of accessibility is to be taken into
account. It should be assessed whether the newspapers
are freely accessible or not. Generally, it is perceived that
news websites are free of cost. There are certain
websites, which require an agreement between the
publisher and the subscriber to access the sites freely.
Table 5 indicates that all the newspapers are freely
accessible and browser independent. About half of the
newspapers provide online subscription facility. The
Hindu, The Decan Herald, The Statesman, The Telegraph,
The Assam Tribune, and The Daily News and Analysis
have online subscription facility. Majority of the
newspapers provide links to access the online archive of
their back issues, except The Hindustan Times, The
Deepika and The Daily News and Analysis. There is no
special cost of intellectual property of the contents of the
online newspapers in India and all of these are public
domains. Advertising can be categorised in many ways.

The most common mode of classifying various forms of
advertising is in terms of product or service. It was found
that all the newspapers have banners to publish
advertisements and majority of these use top frame for the
banners. All the newspapers have links to classifieds.
Pop-ups are present only in the online version of The
Times of India. Majority of the newspapers provide the
facility to post information for the readers. About half of the
newspapers provide links to online shopping, horoscope,
and job advertisements.

4.6 Application of Web 2.0 Technologies
The applications of Web 2.0 technologies in online
newspapers have great importance as these increases
the interactivity with the audience. The investigators
assessed the extent of use of Web 2.0 technologies in
the online English newspapers in India. Table 6 shows the
use of Web 2.0 technologies such as Blogs, RSS,
Facebook, and so on. The use of Web 2.0 technologies
by the online English newspapers in India is very low.

Among the Web 2.0 technologies used by the
newspapers, RSS, Blogs, and Facebook are the most
used technologies. The online versions of The Times of
India and The Hindustan Times, and The Indian Express
provide links to Twitter also in their sites.

5. CONCLUSION
The online English newspapers in India have a
common pattern of contents, coverage and design.
Contents availability and access to the contents are the
most prevalent options in these newspapers. All the
newspapers are more or less similar in their design and
structure with few exceptions. All the newspapers are
flash enabled and some of these are using photos and
videos gallery. Dead links can be found in Assam Tribune
and The Economic Times. The online versions of The
Hindu, The Statesman, and The Daily News and Analysis
have interactive graphics. This is a very interesting feature
and can be adopted by all other online newspapers in
India. All the online newspapers have presented news
with different headings like business, entertainment,
environment, health, lifestyle, weather, etc. The online
newspapers designers should try to arrange news in a
more appealing manner.
The online versions of the Times of India, The Hindu,
The Indian Express and the Statesman have provided
information about the most read, commented, and emailed news, which help the readers to assess the value
and importance of the news. This facility may be provided
by all the online newspapers in India. Similarly all the
online newspapers have news grouped in âeditorialsâ and
âheadlinesâ, which is innovative and should be given due
attention. The online versions of The Hindu, The
Statesman, and The Decan Herald provide the facility to
send information for the readers. Online version of Decan
Herald provides the facility to save articles and other
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(4)

online newspapers may also follow this facility. Even
though majority of the newspapers have RSS, Blog and
Facebook facilities, the potentialities of these tools are
not exploited fully.
The authors found that the online versions of the
newspapers were initially formed as a complement to the
existing print versions of the newspapers. Looking at the
increasing capability of ICT, the online newspapers should
try to attract and engage more readers by delivering their
products and services in real time, increasing the quantity
of information, upgrading news with photographs, audios
and videos, enhancing the richness and timeliness of
news, and application of Web 2.0 technologies to engage
readers. Online newspapers in India can exploit e-mail,
blogs, RSS, web postings, live chat rooms, online polls
and surveys, discussion forums, etc. to engage their
readers.
These tools and utilities will provide interactive
communication, in the way to make the online
newspapers a public sphere of discussion. E-mail can be
used as easiest way of interpersonal communication
between journalists and readers. Online discussion
forums are one of the most effective ways to turn the
online newspapers into a public platform of debate.
Online newspapers can also use mobile platforms to
expand their audiences and connection with readers
using social media such as Twitter and Facebook. The
growing power of social networking is evident from the
time spent by readers on sites such as Facebook. The
time spent on social networking sites is growing three
times faster than that spent on the Internet and
represented a strong channel to connect with readers.
The online newspapers in India should exploit the
emerging Internet and mobile platforms especially the
Web 2.0 technologies to attract and increase their
readers.
