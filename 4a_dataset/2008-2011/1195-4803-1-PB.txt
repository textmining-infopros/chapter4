ABSTRACT
This study evaluates the application of h-index, g-index, and p-index on Indian engineering and
technological institutes. A total of 40 institutes in India have been ranked by the three indices. The analysis
focused on the cluster analysis to segregate these institutes on the basis of ranks generated by these
indices. The degree of correlation among the indices were also been evaluated. The results have shown
that g-index and h-index performed much on the similar lines. An attempt has thus been made to use other
indices like p-index and ACPP method to find a viable segregation on the basis of attributes these indices
deal with.
Keywords: h-index, g-index, p-index, cluster analysis, research performance

1. INTRODUCTION
Over a period of time, India has created one of the
largest infrastructures of engineering and technological
institutes in the country. This could be attributed to the
growth of industries in the country, the increasing
difficulty in getting a respectable job, and the growing
clientele of the young people desiring to enter this arena.
India produces a huge number of engineering and
technology graduates every year1.
Data from scientific publications show that the
world’s scientific hierarchy has remained remarkably
stable over the past decade, with the postindustrial
nations of the United States, Europe, and Japan
continuing to dominate in many fields2. A similar trend is
witnessed in the research performance of the Indian
engineering and technological institutes of India. Some
of these Indian institutes are very prestigious and make it
to the list of top universities in the world. Very few
institutes among the major Indian engineering and
technological institutes, account for most of the research
output of the country. Most of the other institutes,
however, have paltry research output1.
Comparison of performance of these indices on
various data sets has been of interest for researchers,

e.g., determination of relation between the h-index and
Egghe’s g-index for some simple models3 and compare
the values of h and g in the study of 26 physicists from
the Institute of Physics at Chemnitz University of
Technology4. In a study, Huang & Chi5 compared the
application of h-index, g-index, and A-index in
institutional level research evaluation of 99 universities in
Taiwan. Egghe6 also commented, “It would also be
interesting to work out more practical cases (in other
fields) of h- and g-index comparisons”. Bar-Ilan7
compared the h-indices of a list of highly-cited Israeli
researchers based on citations counts retrieved from the
Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar,
respectively.

2. PURPOSE OF STUDY
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate
correlations among the ranking methods of Indian
engineering and technological institutes to determine if a
relationship exists and whether or not these indices are
consistent with the type of institutes.
This study moves beyond previous pair-wise
comparisons to engage in multidimensional analysis that
allows for the examination of many indices
simultaneously. The intent is to articulate specific ranking
377

patterns, and then use them to make inferences about
how Indian engineering and technological institutes might
choose research priorities and develop research
policies.

3. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH
It is assumed that priority with which an institute has
been established has implications for scientific research
output. When specific patterns are made clear, then it
becomes possible to suggest how institute’s researchers
could maximise publications in peer-reviewed journals for
which they are best suited. The attributes, in question
here, are the quality and quantity, productivity and
impact and quality and consistency.

4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
To learn more about patterns of ranking of Indian
institutions in engineering and their relationships, The
following research questions were considered:
(a) Are patterns of ranking of Indian institutions
inengineering discernable according to their
typology?
(b) Which Indian institutions in engineering show similar
and different research performance trends?
(c) Which ranking methods agree with each other most
often?

5. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Five methods of assigning ranks to these institutes
are used. These ranking systems are ranking in terms of
papers; ranking by ACPP, ranking by p-index (ranking by
quality and quantity combined); ranking by h-index
(ranking by productivity and impact) and ranking by gindex (ranking by the quality and consistency).
Some old insights are reinforced and some new
insights emerged. The h-index and g-index are somewhat
related. For an individual or institution, the definitions are
as follows:
•

ACPP is the ratio of citations (C) and papers (P)

•

h-index is the highest count h of publications such
that each publication has at least h citations.

•

g-index is the highest count g of publications, such
that taken together, has an average of at least g
citations per publication.

•

p-index is also geometric mean of C and C/P
modified to the correct dimensionality.

METHODOLOGY

6.1 Data Sources and Data Collection
A total of 40 Indian engineering and technological
institutes with comparatively higher output of publications
during a ten-year period (2000-2009) were identified.
These institutes together have published 32926 papers
during this period, according to publication data
downloaded from Scopus, International multidisciplinary
bibliographical database. The citations received by
papers of these Indian engineering and technological
institutes are considered for first three years (three-year
citation window) from the date of their publications (C).
This allows the average number of citations per paper (C/
P) to be computed for each of these institutes for the
three-year citation window. Also h-indices for these
institutes for the same period (i.e., 2000–2009) were
determined from the Scopus database.

6.2 Analysis Tools
Literal meaning of clustering is to gather to
congregate or draw together. In terms of data
management, clustering means dividing the data in such
a way that similar data points come together. The
objective of clustering is forming the groups that are
heterogeneous but homogeneous within. With the help of
clustering, one can segment the data into small similar
regions and thus comment on the overall distribution
patterns of the data. Clustering is done on the basis of a
similarity measure–attributes/variables to derive the
clusters so that data points in one cluster are more
similar to another (homogeneous) and data points in
separate clusters are less similar or dissimilar to the data
points of another cluster. k-means clustering uses the
partition algorithm which determines all clusters at once.
The k-means algorithm assigns each point to the cluster
whose centroid is the nearest to that point. The centroid
is the average of all the points in the cluster.

6.3 Data Analysis
Table 1 show the complete raw data for top 40 Indian
engineering and technological institutes, i.e., the number
of papers published (P), the citations obtained during the
citation window (C) and the average number of citations
per paper (C/P). Table 1 shows Hirsch h-index8, p-index1
(hm = (C2P))1/3, and g-index6. The ranks of these institutes
are calculated the basis of four methods shown in the
Table 2 and then k-means cluster analysis is applied to
segregate the institutes into different clusters. The aim of
doing this exercise is to find institutes that display similar
research performance.

8. DISCUSSIONS
The expectation that clustering will segregate
institutes with varying productivity, impact, quality, and
consistency was negated. The clusters have values of
ranks on the basis of all the four indices in accordance.
At the most, one can categorise the institutes as very
high, high, low, and poor on productivity, impact, quality
and consistency. This is demonstrated on the basis of
aggregate cluster ranks for the four indices.
The ranks of ACPP method have the least agreement
with ranks of other indices. The g-index was in
agreement with h-index but p-index was also not very
different.

9. CONCLUSIONS
The patterns of ranking of Indian institutions in
engineering are distinguishable according to their
typology. In the first cluster one can find top engineering
and technological institutes in the country like IISc and
the IITs. Cluster 2 depicts some Indian engineering and
technological universities and private institutes that are
doing reasonably better in terms of performance. One
can find here newly-opened IITs and some established
conventional universities. The third cluster portrays
national institutes (recently upgraded to the status of
institutes of national importance). Here, the finding
replicates findings of Prathap & Gupta1. They
commented, “Although the NITs have been around for a
long time (earlier known as RECs), and have been
upgraded to the statusof deemed universities and
institutes of national importance, their research
performance is still dismal”. The worst performance is in
cluster 4, mainly constituting state universities.The
analysis has been successful in discerning the
institutions in showing similar and different research
performance trends. The analysis also did well in

each other.

The study leaves an open question that can we find
an index or a combination of indices which are capable
to segregate institutes on the basis of attributes like
quality and quantity, productivity and impact, and quality
and consistency, e.g., can we segregate institutes that
have high impact but are not consistent, or high in
productivity but low on impact, etc?
