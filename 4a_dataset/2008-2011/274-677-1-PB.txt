ABSTRACT
The study attempts to find out the usage of e-resources of various publishers available under UGCINFONET by the academic community of Manipur University during 2007 and 2008. The study reveals that while
there is an increase in the usage of the resources of most of the publishers in spite of certain problems of
accessibility, resources of some of the publishers were underutilised. Though the study does not investigate
the usage of individual journal covered by each publisher, yet an average of downloads of each publisher
based upon the coverage has been worked out and presented. The study suggests that there is a need to
find out usage of individual product of the publisher in view of the findings that the larger the coverage least
is the use.

INTRODUCTION

Information explosion, heavy demands of clientele,
development of powerful microcomputers, shrinking
library budget, remote location of libraries and rapid
changes in telecommunication systems are forcing the
modern libraries to establish and participate in information
networks. It is neither economically nor physically
possible for any library to acquire all the required
documents especially highly priced journals needed for
its users. To cope up with financial constraints, and to
acquire/subscribe large number of literature published
and available in various forms, resource sharing by way of
coordination and cooperation seems to be the only way
out to control this problem [1]. Majority of the libraries
today have become part of one or the other information
network to augment their resources, which enable them
to participate with other libraries under the network to
obtain not only bibliographic details of the holdings but
can also access full texts, indexes and abstracts of the
required articles using e-mail, fax, Intranet and Internet
attached to the system as per needs and requirements.
Electronic information network is the basic necessity for
resource sharing which provides effective communication
and speedy services to remote users [2]. The scenario of
Received on 17 June 2009; Revised on 11 August 2009

resource sharing during the last two decades has
drastically changed due to more and more libraries
automating their catalogues, acquiring resources in
electronic format and getting connected to one or the
other network. Networking and resource sharing is the
only method or option to overcome the limitations and
inadequacy of resources and build up large databanks
irrespective of ownership by way of cooperation and
coordination of resources among participating libraries.
This has resulted in easy access of the resources from
the remote nodes adding new dimension to the nature of
library services. In the present scenario, any user or
individual is able to search the library material
electronically and is able to download/ print or copy the
desired document. Such library cooperation, joining and
participation in the network play an important role in the
functioning of a remotely located library like Manipur
University library, where geographical location is a great
hurdle in accessing and using information from other
locations. Thus, joining and participation in networks/
consortia of remotely situated libraries become
increasingly important.
India has now many networks for sharing of
resources in various disciplines. More and more such

networks are likely to be evolved for better utility of
information and knowledge. In the present knowledge
society, information management and dissemination is
the priority area. Establishment of INFLIBNET has been
undoubtedly a landmark achievement and its contribution,
especially to financially deficient libraries, has been most
significant. In spite of various problems associated with
accessing of information, UGC-INFONET has developed
good e-resource open to the universities and colleges of
India. So far as usability of the resources is concerned, it
has a upward trend and dependence of academic
community on this network is increasing despite certain
local problems of connectivity in certain universities.

PREVIOUS STUDIES

Large number of studies have been conducted on
use of e-resources including e-journals. Manjunatha and
Shivalingaiah in a study on electronic resource sharing in
academic libraries observed that the technical
advancements provided a platform for digital resource
sharing and opportunities for librarians to become more
technical and professional. They also presented the
requirements and strategies for effective resource sharing
in academic libraries [3].
Another study conducted by Vishala and Bhandi on
availability of library and information science electronic
journals through UGC-INFONET project aims to create
awareness among the library and information
professionals including research scholars, faculty and
postgraduate students of library and information science
regarding the availability of the scholarly journals in the
field of library and information science [4]. A survey of 200
users of Mysore University on use of e-journals and
databases subscribed by UGC-INFONET consortium
presented the use of Internet as an alternative to UGCINFONET consortium resources [5]. In a case study,
Chand and Nishy examined the changing face of libraries
particularly with regard to the journal subscription from
print to electronic form through formation of consortia and
necessity for widening the journal subscription [6].
A study on trends in open access publishing in India
observed that among the top 25 open access publishing
countries, India ranks 12th for the overall number of
journals [7]. Sathyanarayana discussed the J-Gate and
open access databases and their salient features [8].
Another case study at Central Glass and Ceramic
Research Institute on access to electronic journals
through CSIR consortia highlighted the advantages of
consortia [9].
A case study on use of electronic information
resources at Thapar University showed the increasing
trend in the use of e-journals [10]. A survey conducted by
Joteen Singh, Madhuri Devi and Raychaudhury on the use
of the electronic information focusing on the Internet
14

services by the users of Manipur University highlighted
the difficulties and satisfaction level of users about
Internet-based e-resource services [11].

UGC INFONET: E-JOURNAL CONSORTIUM

The UGC-INFONET Digital Library Consortium was
formally launched in December 2003 by Dr A.P.J. Abdul
Kalam, the then Hon'ble President of India, soon after
providing the Internet connectivity to the universities in the
year 2003 under the UGC-INFONET programme. The
Consortium proved to be a recipe to university libraries,
which have been discontinuing subscription of scholarly
journals because of "serials crisis" mainly caused by
increase in subscription rates of serials and shrinking
library budget. The term "serials crisis" refers to
exponential and continuing increase in subscription cost
of scholarly journals and institutional trend to decrease
the library budget. It is estimated that the rise in cost of
journals happened much faster than the rate of inflation.
The UGC Consortium provides current as well as
archival access to more than 5000 core and peer-reviewed
journals and nine bibliographic databases from about 20
publishers and aggregators in different disciplines. The
programme has been implemented in phased manner. In
the first phase that began in 2004, access to e-resources
was provided to 50 universities including Manipur
University, which had Internet connectivity right from the
launching of INFLIBNET under the UGC-INFONET
connectivity programme. In the second phase, 50 more
universities were added to the programme in the year
2005. So far 153 Universities out of 171 that came under
the purview of UGC have been provided access to UGCINFONETbut at different levels; some have full access to
all the resources whereas some have been provided with
limited access to limited number of databases. These eresources covers almost all subject disciplines including
humanities, social sciences, physical sciences,
chemical sciences, life sciences, computer sciences,
mathematics and statistics, etc. The programme is being
fully funded by the UGC and executed by the INFLIBNET
Centre, Ahmedabad, for the benefit of academic
community of Indian universities.

MANIPUR UNIVERSITY: AN OVERVIEW

Manipur University now has 34 government colleges,
eight government-aided colleges, 18 permanently
affiliated private colleges, seven private affiliated colleges
and six permitted private colleges. In addition, the
university itself has 25 postgraduate departments. The
university library is located at the heart of the university as
the nerve centre of academic and research activities
having about 2,264 registered users comprising of 1,278
PG Students, 500 Research Scholars, 136 Teachers, 350
Non-teaching Staff and some other unregistered users
from the state who are also users of the university library.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(6)

The library has a collection of over 1, 50,000 books, and
280 printed journals. Library is well supported by 30
Internet node facilities and reprography services.
Collection of the library can also be browsed from different
departments through campus network. The campus
network covers all the departments including library,
administration, sports, audio-visual research centre, and
four different hostels. The number of computers in the
network is over 400 and is supported by 2 Mbps leased
line Internet connection. UGC-INFONET is accessible
under whole campus area network for wider usability of
resources.

4.1 Training Programme
The Manipur University library is actively
participating in various training programmes conducted by
INFLIBNET Centre, Ahmedabad. Besides, the library has
conducted varieties of training prgrammes like orientation,
awareness and seminar with the help of INFLIBNET,
Ahmedabad, to promote the use of library resources. A
week long Regional Training Programme, financed by
INFLIBNET, was conducted from 23-28 July 2002 on
library automation for college librarians and other library
professionals. The library also organised many
awareness programme on UGC-INFONET in the year
2004, 2006 and 2008 with the financial support from
INFLIBNET; INFLIBNET has been giving liberal financial
support to conduct various training programmes
particularly to promote the use of its e-resources.

OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

UGC-INFONET has grown into a large network of
academic libraries over the years and has large number of
resources to share, particularly e-journals, among
academic libraries of India. Academic libraries who are
using UGC-INFONET have discontinued individual
subscription to journals and mainly depend upon the
services being offered under the said network. However,
many libraries with good library budget are subscribing
their own print and e-journals according to their
requirements. Availability of resources does not matter
much as large collection having least use defeats the very
purpose of collection building. Therefore, it is a common
concern to know the usage of resources being subscribed
under the network and determine the cost effectiveness of
the system. Usage is the key index to evaluate the
services of the network.
The number of resources available under the network
does not matter much, it is the extent of use of resources,
which is important and matters. The bundle price of
subscription of journals is to be evaluated on the statistics
of downloads from individual title. If bundle price is being
paid for 1000 journals of a particular publisher, and the
usage is only of 100 core journals, it compels the
professionals to rethink whether to go for bundle pricing
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(6)

policy or should subscribe only those journals which are
being used at a certain minimum levels. This presupposes the study of usage of individual title based upon
the login method and download.
The best methodology of usage of e-resources in
Internet environment is login vide where actual use can be
determined. It is much more authentic method than
questionnaire-based data collection. Since usage and
download from each title is not feasible due to lack of
authentic methodology available, so present study is
limited to achieve the following objectives:
(i)

To determine number of downloads from each
publisher from UGC-INFONET.

(ii) To make comparison of downloads among various
publishers to find out the popularity of the publishers
products and their relationship with the subjects.
(iii) To find out the awareness of usage of e-resources
among faculty members and students disciplinewise.
(iv) To make the statistical presentation of comparison of
download of subject databases and databases
dealing with multi-disciplines.

6.

METHODOLOGY

The usage/download of e-resources of 20 publishers
was found out by way of logging-into Inflibnet website
where year-wise download statistics was available. Thus,
data pertaining to Manipur University was captured for the
year 2007 and 2008 for the purpose of present study. In
certain cases a data for some months were not available
so had to be excluded for analysis. However, average
download was found for each month. As the available data
for most of the publishers do not pass the test for the
normality assumption, a non-parametric test called the
Wilcoxon rank test was used for the comparison [12].
Wilcoxon rank test is used to test the difference between
mean numbers of download among different publishers
during the given years for the purpose of comparison.

order to establish the trend of popularity of each publisher.
Subject consideration was taken into account to know the
usage of the respective subject(s).

download from RSC in comparison to ACS was much less
yet it is important to note that increase was significant in
RSC, i.e., 2.8 times, showing that resources became
more popular.

The mean number of downloads during 2007
and 2008 for ASC and RSC are presented in Table 4.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

9.1 Chemistry and Allied Sciences

The analysis shows that for both 2007 and 2008, the
mean number of downloads for ACS was more than five
times during 2007 and more than three times during 2008
as compared to RSC. So far as individual increase in
download is concerned, it is in RSC where increase was
noted almost three times showing that usage of RSC in
the latter year increased substantially as shown in
Table 4.

Monthly downloads in chemistry during 2007-08
from ACS (American Chemical Society) and RSC (Royal
Society of Chemistry) have been shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Data for November and December for 2008 was not
available so had to be excluded.
In both the years, increase in download is quite
evident even ignoring data for two months (for 2008) as
shown in the Table 2 which comes to 1.56. Though

of titles is taken into account, which is 18 and 46 in AIP
and IOP, respectively, the download was expected more
in IOP. In view of the scope and coverage of IOP, the usage
should have been at least two times if not more. The result
of statistical analysis using Wilcoxon test is presented in
Table 9. Table 9 shows that there is neither significant
increase in download over the years or difference between
the two in respect of usage in each year.

The results of performing Wilcoxon rank test for
testing the difference between the above means are
presented in Table 5. As shown in the Table 5, the pvalues are all significant at 5 per cent level and it can be
statistically concluded that:
(i)

There was a significant increase in the popularity of
both ACS and RSC from 2007 to 2008.

(ii) ACS was significantly more popular than RSC during
2007 and 2008.

9.3 Library and Information Science
Department of Library and Information Science of
Manipur University offer master degree and PhD
programmes. There is only Emerald Database which is
accessible under UGC-INFONET covering LIS journals.
However, some texts are also available in other databases
such like Taylor and Francis and JSTOR. Data of
downloads from Emerald was done for 2007-2008 to find
out the usage of journals in LIS (Table 10). Except for
November and December 2008, data of downloads for all
the months were available for analysis. Table 10 reveals
that there is fluctuation in downloads. The mean number
of downloads for the year 2007 and 2008 were 149 and
127, respectively. Wilcoxon rank test used to determine
the p-value which comes to 0.674 showing that there is no
significant difference between the mean numbers of
downloads from Emerald during the years 2007 and 2008.
Instead, there has been decline in download in 2008 by
1.4 times.

It also has to be borne in mind the coverage of titles
by the publisher concerned while doing such comparison.
The coverage of ACS and RSC is 37 and 29 titles,
respectively. In view of this, use of ACS in Manipur
University is much higher than RSC.

9.2 Physics and Allied Sciences
To determine downloads in the Physics, AIP
(American Institute of Physics) and IOP (Institute of
Physics) were considered. Tables 6 and 7 show the
number of downloads form these publishers. The increase
in downloads, both from AIP and IOP, is comparatively
less as compared to ACP and RSC. Increase is not even
two times in the later year both in AIP and IOP. The mean
number of downloads are presented in Table 8. The
average of downloads shows that the neither the use is
significant nor the increase from 2007 to 2008. If coverage

9.4 Publishers Covering Multiple Disciplines
The available data on usage statistics of UGCINFONET in the Manipur University also includes
publishers, which deal with multiple subjects/disciplines.
In this study, an attempt has also been made to compare
the usage statistics of publishers having multiple
disciplines. To make the comparisons rational, pairs of
publishers having more or less similar disciplines have
been clubbed together. Some of the publishers, whose
download is available for less than four months, have been
excluded for analysis.

9.4.1 Springer Link
Springer Link covers 1950 journals of many
disciplines. The usage statistics for 2007 and 2008 is
shown in Table 11. The table shows that the number of
downloaded articles from Springer Link has increased in
2008 compared to 2007. The mean number of downloads
during the two years is tested for equality and the p-Value,
and was found 0.0032, which is highly significant. Thus,

from Springer Link, the mean number of downloads is
significant with the increase of roughly two times in 2008
as compared to 2007. However, if the number of journals
being covered by Springer Link is taken into account,
download/ usage is quite low; less than one article on an
average from each journal during 2007, which increased to
about three articles from each journal in 2008.

9.4.2 Cambridge University Press and Oxford
University Press
Download from the two publishers have been
presented in Table. 12 and Table13. CUP as well as OUP
is multi-disciplinary publishers and cover almost similar
disciplines. Usage statistical data of OUP for the year
2008 was not available, so had to be excluded. The mean
numbers of download from Springer Link, CUP, OUP, and
JSTOR are given in Table 14, and the results of Wilcoxon
test in Table 15.
Table 14 and 15 show that during the year 2007, the
mean number of downloads from Springer Link is

coverage does not lead to more use. But it is more
important to identify the resources of these publishers,
which have maximum and minimum use, and measure
the level of satisfaction of users from such resources.
There is a need to conduct such studies further.

significantly larger than that of OUP. From CUP, there is
no significant increase in the mean number of downloads
from 2007 to 2008. During 2007 the mean number of
downloads for OUP is significantly larger than CUP.
Maximum download was found from JSTOR for the year
2007 followed by the Springer Link.

10. CONCLUSION
The study shows that there is an upward trend in the
usage of e-resources except from Emerald in which
download in 2008 decreased from 2007. In 2008, Manipur
University downloaded 34,302 articles showing the
increase of 41 per cent as compared to the usage in 2007.
It is also observed that between the single discipline
publishers like ACS and RSC, ACS is significantly more
popular than RSC, whereas there is no significant
difference in the two physics publishers, i.e., AIP and IOP.
Study also found that usage of e-journals of chemistry is
more than physics journals. This shows that there is more
awareness about UGC-INFONET among the faculty
members and students of Department of Chemistry than
the students and faculty of Department of Physics. If
coverage of e-journals is taken into account, the average
downloads for 2007 and 2008 comes to 84 and 34 articles
annually from each journal covered in ACS and RSC in the
field of chemistry, respectively. Downloads in physics
form AIP and IOP were 61 and 25 articles from each
journal. Average download from Emerald for each title
within its coverage is 53 articles annually. Among
multidisciplinary publishers, JSTOR has the highest
mean number of downloads (1334 annually) as compared
to Springer Link, CUP, and OUP, which on an average
have 803, 58, and 90 downloads, respectively for 2007
and 2008. If download from each title is considered, it
comes to 0.2, 0.1, 0.4 and 1.1 for Springer Link, CUP,
OUP and JSTOR, respectively showing that wider
