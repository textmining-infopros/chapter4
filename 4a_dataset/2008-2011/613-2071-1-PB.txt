ABSTRACT
Due to information explosion library and information centres have important role to play in the information
society. Only well-trained manpower can handle this situation efficiently and effectively. Meeting the need of
development of manpower requires a systematic education for library professionals. This paper deals with the
LIS Education in east and North-eastern India covering eight states of North-eastern India, Orissa, and West
Bengal. Identifies that in this region LIS education was started in West Bengal and spread over other
neighbouring states. This glorious history is mentioned here. The paper identifies that undergraduate courses
were started in many colleges, but most of these have been stopped due to many reasons whereas a few of
these still exist. At present, there are different levels of courses, viz., CLIS, BLIS, MLIS, MLIS in DL, PGDLAN,
MPhil, PhD, DLit, etc. of various durations. Need of standardisation of these courses is essential. Data related
to admission requirements, course content, course material delivery: teaching methods have been collected
through questionnaire, interviews, and from respective websites. The data present status of today’s LIS
education in this region.
Keywords: Library and information science, LIS education, east and north-east India, admission requirements,

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Scope

It happened exactly 100 years ago, in 1911, when
the then Maharaja of the erstwhile Baroda Sayajji Rao
Gaekwad II felt the need of libraries for education of the
masses to lead the all-round development of the society,
and established a network of libraries in the State of
Baroda with the help of William Alanson Borden.
Consequently, the Maharaja realised the need of trained
manpower for these libraries to achieve his goals and
started a library science school for the first time at
Baroda in 1911. Though it started in the western part of
India, but slowly spread all over India. During the last
100 years, Indian libraries have witnessed many
experiments conducted at their shelves and sections.
Indian libraries had been the test-bed of Prof. S.R.
Ranganathan, a great scientist. Prof. Ranganathan
initiated expansion of library education in India. He
advocated organising library education programme at
university level1. LIS education has been evaluated
regularly for further improvements. UGC-CDC Report by
Karisiddappa Committee gave some recommendations
in 2001. Now time has come to discuss and evaluate the
system again to proceed for the future.

In this paper, LIS education in East and North-east
(NE) India has been discussed. Eight states of NE, viz.,
Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram,
Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, and Sikkim have been
included in addition to two states of East India, viz.,
West Bengal and Orissa. Levels of courses offered by
universities and/or other organisations, admission
requirements, course content, course delivery, teaching
methods, availability of infrastructural facilities,
employability, etc., have been discussed on the basis of
data collected from respective websites, questionnaires,
and personal interviews. Glorious history of LIS
education in these states has been traced and recorded
which presents development and trends2, 3.

2. LIS EDUCATION IN EAST AND NORTHEAST INDIA: A RETROSPECT
Of 10 states, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur,
Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim,
Orissa, and West Bengal, the last one as found, has the
credit of introducing LIS education for the first time for
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

Eastern and NE India. It was possible through
establishment of Bengal Library Association (BLA). In
1924 during the Belgaon Session of the Indian National
Congress, through the persistent efforts of late Sushil
Kumar Ghosh, the 4th All India Public Library
Conference was held under the chairmanship of the
great patriot Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das where a
resolution was adopted in favour of recommending the
formation of Library Associations in each of the
provinces. Consequently, the first All Bengal Library
Conference was held in Kolkata on 20 December 1925
to form a library association for Bengal. Late JA
Chapman, the then Librarian of Imperial Library, Kolkata
presided over the Conference. During this Conference
the All Bengal Library Association was formed under the
presidentship of the renowned poet Rabindranath
Tagore4. The Association was renamed as Bengal
Library Association (BLA) in its another conference held
on 14 September 1933 and the introduction of
librarianship training programme was recommended for
producing trained manpower towards smooth running the
libraries in this part of India.

2.1 West Bengal
As a part of their movements towards saving the
interests of librarians, the Bengal Library Association
(BLA) pioneered major steps to introduce librarianship
training programme in West Bengal. BLA in
collaboration with Hooghly District Library Association
started the first library science training camp for working
library staff at Bansberia (near Kolkata) in June 1934.
This two-week course was attended by 12 participants.
In July 1935, another attempt to start a diploma course
in librarianship in the Imperial Library, Kolkata, was
made under the supervision of the then Librarian, Khalifa
Md. Asadulla Khan4. This course was conducted for 20
graduates working in government libraries all over India.
Starting of a month long summer training course in
librarianship was an historical event through which the
Certificate Course in Librarianship was introduced on a
regular basis in this part of India. It is a landmark of LIS
education in Eastern and NE India of pre-independence
period5. The then Editor of The Statesman, W.C.
Wordsworth inaugurated this first Certificate Course on
30 April 1937 at the Asutosh College. Rabindranath
Tagore sent his best wishes on this occasion,
mentioning “I wish the efforts of the Bengal Library
Association all success. The Association will meet a
great demand in the country by training qualified
librarians”6. Of 60 applicants, 20 were selected for
admission in the aforesaid course and 17 of them
successful completed the course. They were conferred
with the Certificates on 24 July 1937 during the 4th
Conference of the Association organised in the Asutosh
Hall, University of Calcutta. In 1939, BLA shifted its
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

course from Asutosh College to the Calcutta University
campus. Subsequently the duration of the course was
extended to four months. This course had good impact
within a short period. This course was not confined to
West Bengal. Students from different parts of India, even
from abroad, attended this course. To meet the demand,
BLA had to open another section in 1951 to make the
students’ strength double. Apart from the above referred
summer course, a week-end course of 7 months
duration was started in 1955. At present, the
Association is running these two courses with intake
capacity of 65 each7, 8.

2.1.1 University of Calcutta
The University of Calcutta is the first one to start a
training programme in librarianship at university level in
eastern part of our country. Students of surrounding
states and the states of NE were benefited till they
could introduce it in their states. On 17 August 1944,
the syndicate of the university considered the
resolutions of the library sub-committee to the effect
that, “The University will institute a Diploma course in
Librarianship every year. The course including the
examination will extend over one year beginning in the
month of January.” Admission to the course was open to
graduates and the intake was limited to 15 students
only. As there was no separate department, a
Librarianship Training Committee was appointed every
year to run the course. The arrangement, called the
Librarianship
Training
Department
under
the
administrative control of Library Department (i.e., the
University Librarian) was placed with the Faculty of Arts.
The first Diploma Library Training Programme started in
January 1945. In 1959, the Training Department was
separated from the Library Department and was
renamed as “Department of Library Science”. A separate
and independent Faculty for PG Studies in Library
Science was created under which the department was
placed.
From the 1969-1970 session, the Diploma was
replaced by PG Degree of Bachelor of Library Science
(BLibSc). In 1998 the department was renamed as the
Department of Library and Information Science offering
the course called Bachelor of Library and Information
Science (BLIS). From the very beginning the course was
conducted in the evening and the same is being
continued. The department is presently under the
Faculty of PG Studies in Education, Journalism, and
Library and Information Science. Total intake for the
course is 110 at present.A master degree course was
introduced in 1973. The classes started in 1974 and the
first batch of successful students came out in 1976. The
name of the course was Master of Library Science
(MLiSc). It is a 2-year course at par with other master
degree courses of the Calcutta University. In 1998 the
33

course was renamed as MLIS. Intake of students for the
course was initially 10, which later was increased to 22.
In 2003, the department introduced self-financing MPhil
programme with classes conducted in the evening9.

2.1.2 Jadavpur University
Jadavpur University was established in 1952. The
Department of Library Science was constituted in 1964
under the PG Faculty Council of Arts to offer the BLibSc
of one-year duration. The name of Department was
changed to the Department of Library and Information
Science in 1984. Since then, the department has
introduced one-year MLIS. The nomenclature of BLibSc
was also subsequently changed to Bachelor of Library
and Information Science (BLIS). In 2003, these courses
were converted to the semester system comprising 2
semesters for each course. Considering the growth in
digital library aspects, the department started a parttime (evening) PG Diploma in Digital Library
Management in 2005 of two-year (four semesters)
duration; the nomenclature has again been changed as
MLIS in Digital Library since 2007, but it is kept as
evening (part-time) course of the same duration. Intake
for BLIS, MLIS, MLIS in DL (part-time ) is 60, 16, and
15, respectively. The department has also introduced
PhD programme10.

2.1.3 Burdwan University
The University of Burdwan was established in 1960.
In 1965, it started offering one year Diploma in
Librarianship by establishing Institute of Library Science.
In 1970, the name was changed to Department of Library
Science, which started offering BLibSc. The
nomenclature of the department was changed to
Department of Library and Information Science in 1980.
Subsequently, nomenclature of BLibSc was changed to
BLIS. One-year MLIS and PhD were also introduced.
The MPhil programme was introduced during 2007-08
academic session. Intake for BLIS, MLIS, and MPhil is
65, 15 and 10, respectively11.

2.1.4 Vidyasagar University
In 1985, Vidyasagar University was opened with six
PG departments including the Department of Library and
Information Science, which started offering BLIS. MLIS
and PhD were introduced in 1987 and 1992,
respectively. At present, intake for BLIS and MLIS is 35
and 15, respectively12.

2.1.5 Rabindra Bharati University
To cope with the professional manpower
requirements for various types of libraries and
information centres, Rabindra Bharati University,
established the Department of Library and Information
34

Science under PG Faculty of Arts in 1985 at Jorasanko
Campus. Initially it started offering BLIS. BLIS was also
started as evening course in 1986. The University has
introduced MLIS since 2007. Intake for BLIS and MLIS
are 40 and 10, respectively13.

2.1.6 North Bengal University
North Bengal University took initiative to establish
Department of Library and Information Science and
started offering BLIS since 1990-91 with intake of 56
students. The department has introduced one-year MLIS
degree since 2005-06 with 40 seats. From 2009, the
department adopted semester system for one-year BLIS
course14.

2.1.7 Kalyani University
The Department of Library and Information Science
of Kalyani University was established in 1991. A oneyear PG Course leading to the BLIS was formally
inaugurated on 29 April 1992. Subsequently, a MLIS
course was introduced during 1999-2000. The
department has introduced the semester system for
BLIS and MLIS courses from the academic session
2008-2009. At present, intake for BLIS and MLIS is 30
and 15, respectively. A PhD programme forms an
integral part of departmental research activities15. The
Directorate of Distance Education (DDE), Kalyani
University introduced MPhil in distance mode in 2008.

2.1.8 Netaji Subhash Open University
This university is offering BLIS and MLIS in distance
mode16. It does not have a fixed intake, therefore scope
of producing a large number of LIS degree holders. For
example, in 2007 a total of 1061 students were admitted
in BLIS and 180 students in MLIS; in 2008 intake was
5160 in BLIS and 225 in MLIS; in 2009 intake was 2750
for BLIS and 278 for MLIS.

2.2 Orissa
LIS education in Orissa came into existence during
1967-1968, when SKDAV Polytechnic for Women,
Rourkela, introduced a two-year post-matric diploma
course. The course was conducted by the State Council
of Technical Education and Training under the
administrative control of the Department of Industries,
Government of Orissa. The Board of Secondary
Education of Orissa, Cuttack, started a one-year postmatric certificate course in library science in 1974, but it
could not be continued for more than a year. This paved
the way for starting another post-matric certificate
course by the Utkal Library Association during 19781979, but in 1987 it was also discontinued17. Thus
Orissa is the first state in India to include library science
curricula in graduation level in colleges.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

S B Womens’ College, Cuttack, introduced Honours
in Library Science in 1988. Following this, many
colleges in Orissa introduced library science course at
graduation level. Kendrapada College, Cuttack;
Carilapatna College, Cuttack, Chandbali College,
Balasore; and Vedavyas College, Rourkela; are to name
a few of this kind. Even Government of Orissa also
showed interest to open library science courses in 30
colleges. But this initiative did not succeed due to many
reasons. As reported, those who started library science
course had to stop these, except only two colleges (i.e.
SB Womens’ College, Cuttack, and Vedvyas College,
Rourkela). They are still running undergraduate library
science courses, both pass and honours. However,
Pandit Nilakantha College of Library and Information
Science, Bhubaneswar, affiliated to Utkal University is
offering BLIS course.

near Berhampur City, by late Shri Brundaban Nayak, a
philanthropist and former Cabinet Minister, Govt. of
Orissa.

2.2.1 Sambalpur University

North Orissa University established its Department
of LIS in 2001 and started offering one-year BLIS course.
But this system continued for two years only. Since
2003, semester-based two-year integrated MLIS
programme was introduced on self-financing basis with
an intake of 20 students. BLIS course is being offered
through distance mode since 2008. Students receive
regular counselling from the faculty regarding their
academic advancement and placement in various
institutions and organizations21.

The PG Department of Library Science of the
Sambalpur University has been the first of its kind in
Orissa. It introduced one-year BLibSc from the
academic session 1976-77 having total intake limited to
16 students including 8 seats for deputed candidates.
Three years after its inception, the nomenclature of this
department was changed to Department of Library and
Information Science in 1979, changing the course name
from BLibSc to BLIS. Since 1985, the department is
offering MLIS, with the sanctioned intake of 8 students.
The department introduced MPhil course in 1994 which
is the first of its kind in eastern India. In 1995, the
department shifted to its own new building. This is the
only department to have a separate building of its own in
the eastern India18. The department introduced two-year
integrated course in 2000. At present, intake for MLIS
and MPhil is 20 and 5, respectively. The department has
credit of getting UGC-DSR-SAP.

2.2.2 Utkal University
The Department of Library Science of Utkal
University was established in 1981 and started offering
one-year BLIS. Library professionals from the central
library used to look after the departmental activities. In
1984 the department was regularised through the
appointment of permanent faculty members. One-year
MLIS was also introduced in 1984. The name of the
department was changed to Department of Library and
Information Science in 1991 subsequently changing the
nomenclature of the courses also as BLIS and MLIS. In
1997, these were replaced by two-year integrated MLIS
course19. Semester system was introduced in 2007.

2.2.3 SMIT College
Sanjaya Memorial Institute of Technology (SMIT),
Berhampur, Orissa, was started in 1983 at Ankushpur
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

This institute also started to cater LIS education
among the people of South Orissa. The college is run by
a private management under a registered society SMIT.
The college is recognised by Govt of Orissa and is
affiliated to Berhampur University, recognised and
approved by UGC u/s 2(f) & 12(B) of 1956. It is a ISO
9001:2000 certified institution, contributing knowledge,
research and development in LIS education and
profession in India. Number of seats in BLIS amd MLIS
is 48 and 24, respectively. Duration of both the courses
is one-year each20.

2.2.4 North Orissa University

2.3 Assam
2.3.1 Gauhati University
One-year BLIS was introduced by the University
Library in 1966. Initially it was started as an evening
course, headed by the then University Librarian
Jogeswar Sarama. . The University introduced MLIS
since 1979. University’s Department of LIS started
independent functioning since 1 August 1983. The name
of the department was changed as the Department of
Library and Information Science on 1 January 1985 and
it started functioning as a full-time day department. Both
BLIS and MLIS became full-time day courses changing
their nomenclature to BLIS and MLIS. In 1987, PhD
programme was also introduced. From 2001-02, twoyear (four semester) integrated MLIS, programme has
also been introduced22.

2.3.2 Dibrugarh University
The Centre for Library and Information Science
Studies (CLISS), Dibrugarh University was established in
January 2005 with a view to impart education and
practical training in library and information services. A
one-year BLIS programme also introduced with intake of
24 (20+4 endowment) students. In 2007, one-year (two
semester) MLIS programme was introduced with intake
of 20 (15+2 endowment+3 deputation) students23.
35

2.3.3 Assam University
Assam University established Department of Library
Science’ in 2009. But recently it has been renamed as
the Department of Library and Information Science. The
department has introduced MLIS course. This is a PG
full-time day course of two-year consisting of four
semesters with intake of 25 students24.

2.4 Manipur
Manipur University was established on 5 June 1980
at the old historic Langthabal Palace of Canchipur,
Imphal, the capital city of Manipur. It was converted into
a Central University on 13 October 2005. It is the only
University in the state which has library science training
programme. The Department of Library and Information
Science was established on 2 April 1986 and started
offering one-year PG programme in BLIS in response to
the demand for training human resources in the field
particularly for the state of Manipur. Intake was limited to
40. Subsequently, MLIS was introduced in 2004 with an
intake of 6. Since academic session 2006-07, these two
have been replaced by a two-year integrated MLIS
programme with 20 seats with the provision for 5 seats
against lateral entry at the 3rd Semester25. In addition, it
has introduced PhD programme since 1987.

2.5 Meghalaya
Meghalaya was created as an autonomous state
within the state of Assam on 2nd April 1970 and got fullfledged statehood on 21 January 1972. The Northeastern Hill University is the only University of the state
to promote higher education in this hill region. The
Department of LIS was established in 1985 with a new
approach to Library and Information Science education
in the country. The Department introduced for the first
time in the country a two-year integrated programme
leading to MLIS. There are 25 seats of which 20 seats
are reserved for the students from Meghalaya. In
addition, Department also has PhD programme26, 27.

2.6 Mizoram
Mizoram is a new name given to the mountainous
region earlier known as the Lushai hills, a district of
Assam. In 1972 it became a Union Territory. In 1987, it
got full-fledged statehood. Soon after this, Mizoram
witnessed revolution in library activities. These include
establishment and development of number of libraries28.
Due to high literacy rate and reading habits of the
masses, the libraries are constantly getting recognition
from all walks of life. Since its inception, Mizoram
University introduced BLlSc in 2002. In 2003, MLIS of
one-year duration was introduced29. However, these two
courses have been replaced by two-year integrated
MLlSc since July 2005. The Department has also
36

introduced PhD since 2005. In 2007, MPhil was
introduced which is the first of its kind in NE states30.

2.7 Sikkim
DS College, Gangtok, started BLIS in 2004. Earlier
this college was affiliated the North Bengal University,
West Bengal. But with the establishment of the Sikkim
University, the College was automatically affiliated to
Sikkim University, which is a Central University31.

2.8 Tripura
Tripura was integrated with Indian Union in October
1949 and became a Union Territory in November 1956. In
1972 it was elevated to the status of a full-fledged state.
A full-fledged University namely Tripura University started
functioning in 1987. The University has recently started
(2010-11 session) a BLIS course in Ramthakur College,
one of its affiliate. Total intake is limited to 30. Minimum
qualification is graduation with honours in any
discipline32. LIS Education has not started yet in
Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.

3. LIS DEPARTMENTS IN EAST AND NORTHEAST INDIA: PRESENT SCENARIO
Two states of the eastern part of India (West Bengal
and Orissa) and eight states of North-eastern part of
India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya,
Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim) have been
covered in this discussion. As it is found, there does not
exist any training programme imparting LIS education in
the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. Library
professionals of these states are trained generally in
neighbouring states. Tripura is planning to start one-year
BLIS (Semester) programme in Ramthakur Govt College
affiliated to Tripura University in 2010 whereas Sikkim
has already started one-year BLIS (semester)
programme in DS College, Gangtok, affiliated to Sikkim
University since 2008.
Prior to that this college was offering the same
course since 2004 with the approval of North Bengal
University, West Bengal. These two states do not have
any MLIS programme or any of its equivalents. Three
states (Manipur, Meghalaya, and Mizoram) of this region
have one central university in each; Manipur University
(MU), North-eastern Hill University (NEHU), and
Mizoram University (MZU). At this moment all of them
are offering 2-year (4 semester) integrated MLIS and
PhD programmes. In addition, Mizoram University has
MPhil programme. However, they do not have any BLIS
programme; neither have they any kind of diploma/
certificate courses.
Being bigger in area in this region, Assam has
extended scope of LIS education to provide opportunities
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

training for more students in comparison to other states
of the N-E India. Two state universities (Gauhati and
Dibrugarh) and one central university (Assam University)
are offering LIS Education. Assam University is the new
entrants in this list, which is going to offer 2-year (4
semesters) integrated MLIS course from 2010. Gauhati
University is the oldest one to impart LIS education for
entire N-E region. It is offering 2-year (4 semesters)
integrated MLIS and PhD programme. But Dibrugarh
University is offering truncated one-year BLIS and one
year MLIS programmes. None of these 3 universities are
having MPhil course in LIS.
In Orissa, varieties of courses are being offered.
There is (university level) a one-year BLIS, both in
regular and distance mode, 1-year MLIS, 2-year
integarated MLIS course and (undergraduate level) Pass
and Hons courses. Three state universities (Sambalpur,
Utkal and North Orissa universities) are offering
semester-based 2-year integrated MLIS course.
SMIT affiliated to Berhampur University has
truncated BLIS and MLIS course of 1-year duration
each. Sambalpur University is offering MPhil Course.
North Orissa University and Sambalpur University are
offering BLIS and PGDLAN in distance mode. Except
North Orissa University, other three are having PhD
programme. As reported, this is the only state in
Eastern and NE India having undergraduate library
science course.
Scope of LIS education in West Bengal is
comparatively larger than others. Seven state
universities are imparting LIS education here on a
regular basis. All of these are offering truncated BLIS
and MLIS courses. Universities mostly have adopted
semester system while a few of them (marked ‘X’ under
the respective column in the Table 1) are yet to accept
it. Netaji Subhas Open University is offering BLIS and
MLIS in distance mode.

3.1 Level of Courses Offered by Different
Universities/Institutions
Table 2 shows the level of courses of LIS offered by
different universities/institutions. These are: Certificate in
LIS (CLIS), Diploma Course, BLIS, MLIS, MLIS (DL),
MPhil, PhD. As far as employability is concerned, these
degrees are considered as required qualifications for
different level of library workers. DLit program has not
been yet started by any of these universities 33, 34.

3.2 Admission Requirements
Table 3 gives details about the minimum
qualifications required for different levels of LIS education
offered by the universities of east and north-east India.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

Some universities are conducting admission test, some
are depending purely on merit, and a few of these are
adopting both for selecting students for BLIS course.
Admission to MLIS course, depends mostly on the
basis of the marks obtained in BLIS. However, a few of
these are adopting admission test for selecting
candidates. Universities are also adopting new
regulations of UGC for admission to MPhil course.

3.3 Course Contents and Curricular Structure
LIS departments have adopted a regular syllabus
revision policy. Most of the departments revise their
syllabi within a period of five years. They try to adopt the
course contents from the CDC-UGC module to fit
suitably with their curricular structure. Except NEHU
and Utkal University, none of the Universities had 2-year
Integrated MLIS course structure, but after the
recommendations of the CDC, Sambalpur University,
North Orissa University, Manipur University, Mizoram
University, Gauhati University and Assam University
have also adopted this structure along with proposed
modules.
Universities of West Bengal, Sikkim, and Tripura
have decided to continue with the truncated 1-year BLIS
and 1-year MLIS course structure but have adopted
course contents from CDC module. Though 80-90 per
cent course contents have been adopted from CDC
curriculum module, most of the universities follow course
contents depending on local variations. However, there
are variations in distribution of marks in theory and
practice among universities. Weightage to practicals
varies from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, which has gone
up to 50 per cent. While CDC suggested making the LIS
curriculum more practical oriented, much variation is
undesirable.

3.4 Human Resources and Manpower
Development
There is a direct relationship between manpower
development and human resources (faculty members) of
the department. Table 4 shows the distribution of faculty
positions including vacant post at present. Table shows
permanent positions only and Guest teachers/Part-time
teachers have not been included here. Figures in the
table do not represent the sanctioned positions against
the particular category because many faculty members
have been promoted to his/her present positions under
the career advancement scheme. For example, CU does
not have any Professor post but three Readers have
been promoted to Professor. However, the table reveals
that CU is having highest number of faculty positions
whereas DU is having the lowest. When critically
analysed, it is found that many universities are yet to
follow the CDC recommendations in this respect.

3.5 Students’ Intake
Table 5 shows the intake capacity for different level
of courses or programmes offered by universities. None
of these universities under study are offering CLIS. But
in West Bengal, BLA is offering CLIS (one of the most
reputed courses) since last 72 years. Two courses
(Summer and week-end) are also offered with the total
intake of 130 (65 for Summer course and 65 for weekend course). For PhD column, number of students
awarded the degree during last 5 years is given. SET is
conducted in West Bengal, other states under the study
do not have this test. So the number of students cleared
NET/SET during past 5 years is shown in the respective
column. Data was not available for courses offered under
distance mode except the one.
Table 5 shows that West Bengal is producing
maximum number of trained library professionals
through regular courses because CU has the highest
intake capacity. Intake of students in LIS courses by
NSOU in distance mode was 1061 in BLIS and 180 in
MLIS in 2007, 5160 in BLIS and 225 in MLIS in 2008;
and 2750 in BLIS and 278 in MLIS in 2009. In addition to
this, IGNOU also has a good number of study centres in
different states in this region.

3.6 Teaching Methods
Chalk and Talk is the main method used in
teaching. Besides, OHP/LCDs are also being used as
teaching tool. Theoretical discussions, practical classes
and demonstrations, tutorials, are the other modes.

Reader

15+3

1P, 3R, 14L

Extension lectures, special lectures are also held by
inviting professional experts.
As per the recommendations and suggestions of
the UGC-CDC (2001) all the universities are taking
special care to provide a considerable amount of handson practice on latest tools and techniques. Study tours
and visits, field survey works, etc. are part of their
syllabi. Project works, sessional tests, assignments,
dissertations on various topics also make part of the
course content. But due to lack of infrastructural
facilities these are not sometimes implemented.

3.7 Infrastructural Facility
Being a professional course, LIS education is
practice-oriented and based on special tools and
techniques. Besides, traditional tools, ICT tools are also
being used now-a-days in large scale to develop skills
and competencies for best practices in libraries. Table 6
gives a list of traditional tools (Classification schemes
and Cataloging codes, Subject Headings (SH) lists) and
ICT tools available with the universities. Table 6 shows
that many departments are still using DDC19th edition
and a few are using 22nd edition of DDC. In addition, the
ratio 1:2 (at least one schedule/code for two students) is
not been implemented in many cases. Such variations
affect the quality training. However, ICT infrastructure is
bit better than the traditional one. But it can not be said
that it is sufficient in terms of number and use.
Infrastructure facilities in study centres of NSOU are in
very bad shape.

3.8 Evaluation
Usual policy of attendance is being used as the first
screening criteria for appearing in the final examinations.
In the syllabi projects, survey reports, dissertations are
added by the universities as per the recommendations of
the CDC. Hence submission of assignments, survey
reports, project works, dissertations, etc. and their
evaluation is done separately.
There are annual evaluation systems along with
sessional tests, submission of project works,
assignments, dissertations, etc., during the session.
Guidance to all students is given on a regular basis.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

But, there is a scope for review of post publication of
results as per university rules. Some universities are
arranging class seminars, colloquia as a method of
evaluation.

3.9 Seminars/Conferences/Workshops
Table 7 gives an overview on seminars, conferences,
refreshers courses, workshops conducted during last
five years by the individual departments. Most of the
departments are active to some extend in this regard.
but outcome of these seminars and how far these have
been practicable to implement is not known. Analysis of
themes/subthemes, discussions, recommendations,

3.10 Role of Associations
History of LIS education in India says that Library
Associations have taken important initiatives for growth
and development of LIS education as well as LIS
profession16. These associations vary in scope and
coverage depending. In north-east India, some state
level associations are also there in addition to two/three
national level associations. In Arunachal Pradesh and
Sikkim, there is no library association. In Assam, there
are a few library associations, viz., Assam Library
Association, Assam Public Library Service Association,

and their implementation can be a separate study which
is not within the scope of this paper.UGC Refresher
Courses have been organised by the Academic Staff
College of the Universities to train teachers on LIS and
Librarians to keep them uptodate. But it has been
realised that such Refresher Courses need to be
restructured.

Assam College Librarian’s Association, Guwahati
Library Association, Rural Library Association, and
Government Library Association. Of these, Assam
Library Association is at present working actively.
In Manipur, two associations, viz., All Manipur
College Library Association (AMCOLA) and Manipur
Library Association (MALA) are functioning. MALA is
organising certificate courses. Meghalaya Library
Association was formed in 1994 and is conducting
certificate courses in collaboration with NEHU. In
Nagaland, the Nagaland Library Association (NLA) was
established in 1996. Mizoram Library Association (MILA)
is the only library association in the state.
One of its objectives is to conduct training on library
technologies. YMA (Young Mizo Association) is also
playing a vital role for the public library service and
movement in Mizoram. In Tripura, there are two Tripura
Library Association (TLA) and Nikhil Tripura Granthagar

Parishad. TLA conducts certificate course35. In Orissa,
Utkal Library Association used to offer certificate course.
In West Bengal, BLA is efficiently conducting certificate
courses. There are two more, West Bengal Public
Library Employees’ Association (WBPLEA) and West
Bengal College Librarians’ Association, in West Bengal
who are sometimes conducting continuing education
programmes.
As far as national level associations are concerned,
Indian Association of Special Libraries and Information
Centres (IASLIC), Indian Association of Teachers of
Library and Information Science (IATLIS), and Indian
Library Association are performing well. In mid-sixties
when none of the univer-sities in eastern India offered a
masters level programme in LIS, IASLIC conducted a 1year evening course in Special Librarianship and
Documentation. After a couple of years when advanced
courses were started at other centres, the course was
ter-minated and stress was laid on other continuing
education programmes36. IASLIC has created one
Education Division to organise short-term training
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

courses/workshops/round-table meetings on various
topics to improve professional competencies. These
programmes are also organised in NE region. IASLIC
conducts seminar/conferences/SIG meetings on “LIS
Education”. Their outcomes/recommendations have
been either adopted by the UGC review committee37 or
have been used as guiding factors for UGC-CDC38.

4. MAJOR OBSERVATIONS
For the purpose of this study, the departmental
teahers of these universities helped to provide
information related to their respective departments.
Websites of these universities were also consulted for
the same. In addition to these, comments of many
leading professionals and faculty members were
collected through personal contact. On the basis of
these the following observations have been made:


Out of these 20 institutes under study, nine have
adopted 2-year Integrated MLIS course merging 1year BLIS and 1-year MLIS, and 11 have opted to
continue truncated BLIS and MLIS. West Bengal,
43

Sikkim, and Tripura are in favour of continuing this
truncated system fully as on today. According to
them, they desire to produce professionals for
different level of jobs in libraries. In Assam and
Orissa, though majority of the Universities are
running 2-year Integrated MLIS course, at least one
in each of these two states are running truncated
courses with the same objective. In West Bengal,
duration of MLIS (in truncated system) is of two
years in CU and JU. Are all of them equivalent?
Other than library professionals, other may raise
this question any time. This question must be
addressed with justification.






44

Orissa started offering library science in
undergraduate level leading to Pass or Hons degree
in Library Science for the first time in this region.
Govt of Orissa decided to open such courses in 30
degree colleges. But at present only two are in
existence. These perhaps could ensuring
employability among students.
Recently there is a move to start 5-year Integrated
MLIS Course in CU for +2 pass outs. It has started
a debate among library professionals in West
Bengal. It is to be noted here that Guru Ghasidas
University, Bilaspur have started the same course
last year closing their regular BLIS and MLIS
course. But they are thinking to revert it from this
session. Hence, again issues of equivalence and
employability are serious in this case.
Analysis of course contents and syllabus gave
satisfactory results. Syllabus is updated to a certain
level following UGC-CDC model curriculum.
Similarities in core subjects were seen up to 80-90
per cent. Rest of the 10-20 per cent variation is
acceptable considering the local need. But as far as
practice papers are concerned in comparison with
theories, the scenario in not satisfactory. There are
variations among universities. As it is a professional
subject, skills and competencies development
among students should be given importance. There
are variations in ratio of theories and practices in
syllabi. For example, in case of BLIS of RBU in
practice 25 per cent and in theory 75 per cent
weightage is given, and for MLIS in practice 30 per
cent and in theory 70 per cent weightage is given.
Whereas in case of BLIS of CU in practice 40 per
cent and in theory 60 per cent weightage is given
and for MLIS in practice 36 per cent and in theory
64 per cent weightage is given. Sometimes this
ratio goes up to 50:50. Of these 10 universities, as
shown in their syllabi, such variations were
observed30.



As far as tools and equipment are concerned, there
are two categories–traditional and ICT tools. It was
observed that universities are using old tools. For
example, for teaching mostly DDC 19th edition is
being used while 22nd edition is used rarely. Again
in comparison with number of students number of
tools available has no parity. So is the case for
other traditional tools. However, computers, though
less in numbers, are available with the departments
to cover ICT components.



While analysing human resources (faculty
members), it was found that some universities have
not filled their sanctioned post. Faculty is required
for quality education. When the semester system is
adopted, requirement of teachers is increased.
Otherwise the system will run at the cost teaching.



Professional courses develop competent and skilled
manpower. Balancing between manpower need and
manpower production is required. A careful study
and decision thereon is essential.



Except one, none of these 20 universities/colleges
has separate building for the department. Only
Sambalpur University has its own building.
Obviously others are facing space problem.



While interacting with library professionals, about
78 per cent of them expressed that the new PhD
rules will be useful to maintain the quality of
research but at the same time they felt that a good
number of potential researchers who are in job will
not be able to do research on part-time basis.

5. SUGGESTIONS
LIS Education is aimed to train students with
adequate knowledge and skills relating to the tools and
techniques of information handling. On completion of
their studies, students must acquire knowledge,
understanding, and experience to apply these in
libraries.
For this purpose LIS education must be well
planned and should be developed with a more realistic
manner. LIS education should not only meet the
immediate needs but the future needs. The scope and
coverage of LIS education should be at par with national
and global standard. The following suggestions are
made:


Designing the syllabus and course structure is
essential for LIS field. To meet the demand of
different level cadres at different sectors, a market
survey is required. This will help to know the market

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

demands which help in designing the need-based
curriculum. A need-based curriculum should balance
between traditional librarianship and scope of
including modern technology like library automation,
networking and Internet. Depending on the different
level of courses, student should acquire knowledge.
To make students capable of working in the digital
environment, digital library, library website, content
development, use and evaluation of web resources,
knowledge management, e-publishing should be
included.


The departments should try to make course more
practice-oriented. CDC suggested a ratio 50:50
among theory and practice components. But it has
hardly been adopted. As it is a professional course,
emphasis on hands-on practice is required to
develop skills and competencies among students.
This must be thought of seriously.



The study found that there are variations in level of
courses. In addition, some institutes may think to
open some new courses with new nomenclature. So
an accreditation council is essential like BCI (Bar
Council of India), MCI (Medical council of India),
NCTE (National Council of Teachers’ Education),
etc. This Accreditation Council has to maintain the
quality and standard of the courses. The Ministry of
Human Resource Development, UGC, and NAAC
should come forward in establishing a national
accreditation council exclusively for LIS to ensure
qualitative development of LIS education.



University should give special care towards
developing up-to-date infrastructural facilities.
Instead of having schedule of old editions they
should buy latest editions.

6. CONCLUSIONS
In India, LIS Education is approaching its centenary.
For the purpose of revamping LIS education, it is
required to reevaluate it. It is found in this study that
many LIS departments have been established over the
period of time but no attention has been paid towards
infrastructure and manpower development. For the
purpose of rendering better services, the library
professionals need to acquire specialised knowledge
and skills relating to its professional tools and
techniques for handling information. Quality LIS
education can make library professionals fully equipped
with the specialised knowledge and skills. Quality LIS
education can not be operative unless proper
infrastructure is developed, skilled teachers are engaged
and so on. However, this study reveals that there are

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

many constraints and problems faced by the LIS
Schools to impart proper education in India.
Many LIS schools are lagging behind in terms of
infrastructure, human resources, and sufficient financial
support. Many schools are using 19th edition of DDC till
today. Though ICT components have been included in
the syllabus, proper hands on is not sufficient due to
lack of infrastructure. To develop need-based curriculum,
interaction with different sectors like agricultural,
industrial, etc is required. It is also equally important to
make the teachers of LIS up-to-date which will have an
impact on teaching and learning. Though UGC has
career oriented courses like Refresher Course,
Orientation Programmes organised by Academic Staff
Colleges, but these needs revamping. It has been
experienced that much emphasis is given to develop ICT
skills of teachers; it is required but not at the cost of
acquiring skills related to professional tools and
techniques. It is painful to remind some of our fellow
professionals that ICT is merely a tool.
Researches on its application over library and
information services, as is done in DRTC and some
other institutes, is always welcome. But apathy in
teaching traditional tools and techniques should not be
encouraged. A close link and coordination is very much
essential among the LIS educators, practitioners, and
researchers. Departments should undertake different
types of training programmes with training modules to
familiarise and develop hands-on experience on the
different components of ICT.
There is a serious need of having standardisation in
LIS education system in India. There should be an
accreditation council exclusively for LIS education.
NAAC does accreditation for the institutes of higher
learning as a whole39, 40. So in India, BCI (Bar Council of
India), MCI (Medical Council of India), NCTE (National
Council of Teachers’ Education), etc. have been
established to maintain quality and to save the interests
of the respective profession/subjects. Unfortunately, LIS
does no have any council of this kind; neither any library
association has been given such responsibilities like
abroad.
Rather in contrast universities/institutions are having
their own autonomy to experiment with. So it is felt that
the Ministry of Human Resource Development in close
coordination with UGC and NAAC should think of
establishing a National Accreditation Council exclusively
in library and information science to ensure qualitative
development of library and information science
education. Library associations like ILA, IASLIC, IATLIS
should start serious movement demanding this.
