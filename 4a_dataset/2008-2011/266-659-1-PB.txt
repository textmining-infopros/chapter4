ABSTRACT
Consortium for e-Resources in Agriculture is a e-Consortium of Agricultural Libraries under the Indian
Council of Agricultural Research for National Agricultural Research System libraries. The National Agricultural
Research System of India comprises Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Central/State Agricultural
Universities under Department of Agricultural Research and Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Govt of India.
The paper discusses the background, main features, and advantages of the consortium for e-resources in
Agriculture.
Keywords: Consortium in agriculture, indian council of agricultural research, national agriculture research
system, information and communication technology

INTRODUCTION

National Agriculture Research System (NARS)
comprises 41 State Agricultural Universities, one Central
University, and Indian Council of Agricultural Research
(ICAR), which again comprises 49 ICARs Central
Research Institutes including ICAR headquarter, five
Deemed Universities, five National Bureaus, 12 Project
Directorates, 30 National Research Centres, 77 All India
Coordinated Research Projects and Networks, eight
Trainers Training Centres, and 562 Krishi Vigyan Kendras
(KVKs) [1].
Indian Council of Agricultural Research is a major
agricultural scientific autonomous organisation in the
country and unique in having concurrent responsibility for
research, education, and extension. Formerly known as
Imperial Council of Agricultural Research It was
established on 16 July 1929 as a registered society under
the Societies Registration Act 1860 in pursuance of the
Report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture. The ICAR
has its headquarters at Krishi Bhavan, New Delhi and is
an apex body for coordinating, guiding, and managing
research and education in agriculture including
horticulture, fisheries, dairy, and animal sciences in the
entire country [2]. ICAR has played a pioneering role in
ushering Green Revolution and subsequent developments
in agriculture in India through its research and technology
development that has enabled the country to increase the
production of food grains by four times, horticultural crops
24

by 6 times, fisheries by 9 times (marine 5 times and
inland 17 times), milk 6 times, and eggs 27 times since
1950-51, thus making a visible impact on the national food
and nutritional security. It has played a major role in
promoting excellence in higher education in
agriculture [2].

2. AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES
An agricultural library is the special library, which
primarily renders service to the policy makers,
specialists, scientists, teachers, students, researchers,
and farmers in agriculture and allied subjects. It is the
nerve centre of all educational, research, trainings and
extension activities in agriculture. Its collection and the
clientele are discrete and pertaining to agriculture and
allied subjects only. Agricultural libraries have now
become highly complex centre with multiplicity of
functions catering to a wide variety of clientele having
divergent interests.
Every agricultural institute/university has got its own
independent library with self-contained budget and
resources to serve their users. Nowadays information
explosion, diversity of user needs, multidisciplinary
research, duplicity of resources, escalation in cost of
foreign journals, and financial crunch have made selfsufficiency which lead libraries to opt for resource sharing.
But advent of Internet, advancement of ICT facilities, easy
and 24x7 accessibility have made the libraries to opt for
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

consortium of e-journals to get maximum coverage of
journals to larger number of users with minimum amount
of budget. To maximise discipline-wise coverage,
relevance of journals to users, number of users relevant to
publishers, economics of pricing models given by
publishers for using additional advantages like unlimited
access, unlimited downloads, easy accessibility, any
where at any time accessbility, full-text downloads, etc.,
made the authorities of ICAR to think about formation of eConsortium under the Project of NAIP Component I: ICAR
as the Catalysing Agent for Management of Change in the
Indian NARS, Sub-component I: Information, Communication and Dissemination System (ICDS), Module I:
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the
name of CeRA (Consortium for e-Resources in
Agriculture) [3].
Sufficient infrastructure like hardware, software,
networking, bandwidth to download full-text of article with
images etc., are prerequisite of any e-Consortium. Since
these facilities are already provided by ICAR to all its
Institutes, Deemed Universities, State Agricultural
Universities and Central University in the first phase of
World Bank project National Agricultural Technological
Project (NATP 1998-2005) the ICAR straight away
considered to form e-Consortium under next phase of
World Bank project National Agricultural Innovation
Programme (NAIP 2006-2012). NAIP is the World Bank
assisted agriculture project being executed by National
Agricultural Research System (NARS) with lifespan of six
years, starting from 24 July 2006 to 2012.

3. FORMATION OF CONSORTIUM FOR
E-RESOURCES IN AGRICULTURE
CeRA was launched successfully on 30 April 2008 at
its headquarters at IARI with the following objectives [4]:
v

To develop the existing R & D information resource
base of ICAR institutes/agricultural universities, etc.,
comparable to that existing in world leading
institutions/organisations.

v

To create an e-access culture among scientists/
teachers in ICAR institutes/SAU.

v

To develop a Science Citation Index (SCI) facility at
IARI for evaluation of scientific publications.

v

To assess the impact of CeRA on the level of
research publications measured through SCI (Fig.1).

CeRA is being hosted at Unit of Simulation and
Informatics, A-0 Block, Lal Bahdur Shastri Building, IARI,
New Delhi-110 012. Its functioning is being monitored by
the following Committees:
Steering Committee
v

Advisory in nature.

v

Policy issues.

Negotiation and Monitoring Committee
v

Negotiate with publishers.
