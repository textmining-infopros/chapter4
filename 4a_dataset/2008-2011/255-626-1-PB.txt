ABSTRACT
This paper attempts to highlight quantitatively the growth and development of world literature on Bhabha
Scattering in terms of publication output as per International Nuclear Information System (INIS) (1970-2008),
Science Citation Index (1982-2008), and INSPEC (1969-2008) databases. During 1969-2008 a total of 1305
papers were published by the scientists in the field Bhabha Scattering. The average number of papers
published per year was 32.62. The highest numbers of papers 66, were published in 1988 and 1997,
respectively. There were 47 countries involved in the research in this field. Germany is the top producing
country with 421 papers followed by USA with 420 papers, Italy with 293 papers, and Switzerland with 263
papers. Authorship and collaboration trends were towards multi-authored papers. There were 888 (68.05 per
cent) collaborative papers. Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Italy, topped the list with 256 papers
followed by European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), Switzerland, with 243 papers. The most
preferred journals by the scientists were: Physics Letters-B with 188 papers, Nuclear Physics-B with 91
papers, and Physical Review-D with 90 papers. The high frequency keywords were: Bhabha scattering (731),
radiative corrections (215), annihilation (214), electrons (208), positrons (205), and pair production (202).
Keywords: Bhabha scattering, electron-positron scattering, scientometrics, bibliometrics, Homi Jehangir Bhabha,
publicationproductivity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Homi Jehangir Bhabha, the architect of Indian
Nuclear Science and Technology was born on 30th
October 1909 in Mumbai. He had his early education at
Cathedral and John Connon Schools, Elphinston College
and Institute of Science, Mumbai. Bhabha joined Caius
College, Cambridge, in 1927 and was a scholar of the
college during 1929-1930. Bhabha obtained Mechanical
Sciences Tripos in First Class in June 1930 and thereafter
went on to work as a research student in theoretical
physics. When the Second World War broke out in 1939,
Bhabha came to India on holidays and remained in India
thereafter. He spent nearly five years at Indian Institute of
Science, Bangalore, where he came in contact with the
Nobel Laureate Sir C.V. Raman.
Dr Bhabha established Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research (TIFR) and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
(BARC) (formerly Atomic Energy Establishment
Trombay), and other DAE establishments in India. He
held many positions in different capacities and received
many awards/honours including Padma Bhushan in
Received on 12 March 2009

recognition of his outstanding contribution in the field of
Nuclear Science and Technology. Bhabha was also an
institution builder, painter, musician, educationist and
administrator. He died in a tragic air crash in Mont Blanc
on 24th January 19661-5.
Bhabha was a distinguished theoretical physicist. He
worked in the field of elementary particles, high-energy
physics for a period of about two decades (1933-1954),
and made many significant contributions. His name, in
this field, is associated with Bhabha Scattering, BhabhaHeitler Cascade theory of Cosmic-Ray Showers, BhabhaCorben theory of Relativistic Spinning Point Particles,
Relativistic Bhabha Equations, etc. Bhabha was the first
person to calculate the cross-section for electron-positron
scattering known as Bhabha Scattering6. There are two
leading-order Feynman diagrams contributing to this
interaction—an annihilation process and a scattering
process. The Bhabha Scattering rate is used as a
luminosity monitor in electron-positron colliders. This
paper is a tribute to Homi Jehangir Bhabha on his birth
centenary year (30 October 2008-30 October 2009) to
highlight the research activities carried out so far by other

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

researchers across the globe in the field Bhabha
Scattering. Research papers are one of the quantitative
measures for the basic research activity in a country. It
must be added, however, that what excites the common
man, as well as the scientific community, are the peaks of
scientific and technological achievement, not just the
statistics on papers. There are also other kinds of
research and technology developments—missionoriented, industry-oriented, country-specific, etc.
Progress in these cannot be obviously measured by
counting only the number of papers7. Many scientometric
studies have appeared in the literature to focus on the
performance of nuclear science in various domains8-10.

4.1 Year-wise Growth of Papers and
Authorship Pattern
During 1969-2008, about 1305 papers were published
on Bhabha Scattering by various countries. The average
number of papers produced per year was 32.62. The
highest numbers of papers (66) were published in the
years 1988 and 1997, respectively. Figure 1 gives yearwise papers published, and authorship trend on Bhabha
Scattering. Figure 1 shows that growth of the literature
was low during 1969-1972 but peaked in 1988 and 1997. It
can also be seen from Fig. 1 that collaboration pattern is
towards multi-authored papers.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the study is to present the
growth of world literature on Bhabha Scattering and make
the quantitative assessment of the research in terms of
year-wise research output, geographical distribution of
research output, nature of collaboration, highly productive
researchers in the field, characteristics of highly
productive institutions, channels of communications used
by the scientists, and the high frequency keywords
appeared in the keywords field in the databases.

4.2 Geographical Distribution of Research
Output
There were as many as 47 countries where research
is being carried out in the field of Bhabha Scattering.
Table 1 lists these countries with their share of research
output. Germany and USA are the top research paper
producing countries with 421and 420 papers,
respectively. Italy with 293 papers, Switzerland with 263
papers, France with 178 papers, England with 155
papers, and Russia with 150 papers are the other
countries doing significant research in the field.

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data was collected from the INIS (1970-2008), SCI
(1982-2008), and INSPEC (1969-2008) databases. The
search string Bhabha Scattering in title, abstract and
keywords field was used to download the records on the
subject. Duplicate records from these three databases
were removed. About 1305 records were analysed using
the spreadsheet application.

4.3 Co-authorship Index
Co-authorship Index (CAI) has been elaborated by
Schubert and Brown11 and is obtained by calculating
proportionally the papers by single-, two-, multi- and
mega-authored papers for different five year blocks. This

Frame12. To find out CAI, papers were divided into four
categories according to the number of authors. These
are: single-authored, two-authored, multi-authored papers
(with three to four authors), and mega-authored papers
with five and more authors.
The CAI was calculated for different five year blocks
(Table 2) for the study. It was found that single-authored

indicates that solo research activity prevailed during 19691993, whereas the group (five or more authors)
collaborative research activity was high during 1994-2008.

4.7 Preference of Journals for
Communication by Scientists

Germany, with 124 papers; and Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, England, with 116 papers. In India Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research is the most productive
institute with 54 papers.

The distribution of papers were spread over 106
journals. The leading journals preferred by the scientists
were Physics Letters-B with 188 papers followed by
Nuclear Physics-B with 91 papers, and Physical Review-D
with 90 papers. Table 6 shows journal-wise publishing of
papers. Out of 910 articles published in various journals,
about 82 per cent were published in the journals with
impact factors ranging from 0.17 to 38.40. This indicates
the publication behaviour of scientists; they preferred to
publish their papers in high impact journals. Remaining 18
per cent of the papers were published in the journals not
covered by SCI database.

4.6 Preference of Channels of
Communication by Scientists
Scientists communicated their papers through
variety of communications channels. Table 5 depicts the
percentage of literature published in different document
types. Journal articles constituted 66.44 per cent of the
total papers followed by reports (18.47 per cent),
conference papers (5.67 per cent), and books (5.52 per
cent).

4.8 Distribution of Keywords

5. CONCLUSION

Keywords are one of the best scientometric
indicators to understand and grasp instantaneously the
thought content of the papers and to find out the growth in
the subject field. Analyses of the keywords, appeared
either in the title or assigned by the indexer or the author
himself, help in knowing in which direction the knowledge
is growing. The high frequency keywords enable us to
understand the various aspects that have been studied. In
the current study the high frequency keywords were:
Bhabha Scattering (731), Radiative Corrections (215),
Annihilation (214), Electrons (208), Positrons (205), and
Pair Production (202). Table 7 lists the keywords
appeared in the keywords field of the databases.

Bhabha communicated his paper to Proceedings of
the Royal Society of London on 20th October 1935, which
was subsequently published in 1936 to calculate crosssection for electron–positron scattering, which later
became an eponym as ‘Bhabha Scattering’. This theory
(still being used by many scientists across the world)
shows the relevance of Bhabha’s theory even after 75
years of his work. The highest numbers of papers (66)
were published in 1988 and 1997, respectively. The
average numbers of papers published per year were
32.62. There were 47 countries involved in the research in
this field. Germany and USA were the top countries which
produced 421 and 420 papers, respectively. Authorship

and collaboration trends were towards multi-authored
papers. There were 888 (68.05 per cent) collaborative
papers. Solo research activity was predominant during
1969-1993, whereas the group collaborative research
activity was high during 1994-2008. The most preferred
journals by the scientists were: Physics Letters-B with
188 papers, Nuclear Physics-B with 91 papers and
Physical Review-D with 90 papers. It will be quite
interesting if one attempts to carryout citation analysis on
this subject.
