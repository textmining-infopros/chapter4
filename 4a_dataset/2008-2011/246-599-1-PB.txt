1. INTRODUCTION
India plays an important role as leader of the
developing countries along with China and Brazil. This
position is reflected on many levels (that is economic,
military, political, etc). It is also reflected in its scientific
and technological level. Over the years, India has invested
heavily in developing infrastructure for R&D in different
fields of S&T, as well as in the frontier areas, such as
atomic
energy,
space
sciences,
electronics,
telecommunications, and more recently in biotechnology.
India’s current R&D spending is around 0.8 per cent of the
Gross Domestic Product, which is likely to increase to 2
per cent in the next five years. As for Germany, its
position in G-7 is clearly reflected in its S&T potential and
research output. A few studies have been conducted in
the past on the profile of Indian science, using
publications output from Web of Science database, and
recently based on Scopus database1-7.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of this paper are to: (i) analyse
the publication share and growth of India and Germany in
terms of world publications output in S&T during 19962006, (ii) compare the similarities in the research profiles
of India and Germany with the top 15 countries of the
world, (iii) analyse the strengths of India and Germany in

terms of publication output and the share of international
collaborative publications in different fields of S&T, (iv)
analyse the collaborative research activity between India
and Germany, as reflected in the co-authored papers
between the scientists of the two countries, the areas of
their focus, and the quality of their output.

3. METHODOLOGY AND DATABASES USED
The publications data on India and Germany and the
other select countries leading in S&T derived from Scopus
database forms the basis of this study. Scopus is an
international multidisciplinary database indexing over
15,000 international peer-reviewed journals in S&T. The
paper analyses 11 years of publications data from 1996 to
2006 of India and top 15 productive countries for
developing S&T indicators. Larger time coverage of data
has been used to ensure accurate and reliable results. A
number of absolute publications, citations and
collaborative measures have been deployed for developing
indicators as needed for depicting India’s status in S&T
from 1996 to 2006.
The Scopus database classifies each item covered
under 20 subject categories of S&T and four broad subject
categories such as physical sciences, engineering
sciences, life sciences, and health sciences. For
classification of papers, we have used the classification
3

used in Scopus. The Scopus database classifies each
paper on the basis of source subject title of the journal or
conference/seminar proceedings. In this analysis, all
types of items covered in Scopus database are covered in
the present analysis. It predominately covers different
types of items presented in journals such as papers,
reviews, short notes, editorials, etc., and articles
presented in conference/seminar proceedings.

4. ANALYSES
4.1 Publication Share, Rank, and Growth Rate
The global publication share of top 15 countries in
S&T in world output ranges from 1.41 per cent to 25.32
per cent during 1996-06. The United States tops the list
with global publication share of 25.32 per cent, followed
by Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, and China (their
global publication share ranged from 5.64 per cent to 7.31
per cent). France, Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Australia,
and India ranked at 6th to 12th positions (their global
publication share ranged from 2.04 per cent to 4.59 per
cent). The other three countries that rank at 13th to 15th
positions are the Netherlands, South Korea, and Sweden,
with their global publication share ranging from 1.41 per
cent to 1.91 per cent during 1996-06 (Table 1).
Germany and India contributed 6.36 per cent and
2.04 per cent global publication share, with 4th and 12th
world publication ranks during 1996-06. Amongst these
two countries, the Germany’s global publication share
and rank has decreased from 6.32 per cent (with 4th world
rank) in 1996 to 5.85 per cent (with 5th global rank) in 2006.

India’s global publication share and rank on the other
hand has increased from 1.84 per cent (with 13th world
rank) in 1996 to 2.37 per cent (with 10th world rank) in 2006
(Table 1). India and Germany differ in their annual average
publication growth rates in science and technology. India
achieved a comparatively faster annual average growth
rate of 7.2 per cent (compared to 3.69 per cent in
Germany) during 1996-2006, rising to 10.94 per cent
(compared to 4.69 per cent in Germany) during 2002-2006
(Table 2).

4.2 Subject Priorities of Top 15 Countries in
S&T
The subject priorities of top 15 countries in science
and technology have been determined by computing their
national publication share in physical, engineering, and
life and health sciences during 1996-2006 (Table 3). The
magnitude of national publication share of a country in the
broad subject reflects its research priority in the field. For
example, India’s national publication share by subject in
its total output has been the highest (41.23 per cent) in
physical sciences followed by life sciences (30.34 per
cent), engineering sciences (29.52 per cent) and health
sciences (21.6 per cent). In contrast, Germany’s national
publication share by subject in its total output has been
the highest (37.36 per cent) in physical sciences followed
by health sciences (30.13 per cent), life sciences (29.98
per cent), and engineering sciences (23.72 per cent)
(Table 3).
In the world context, India’s national publication
share in physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering

sciences has been above the global average in each
broad discipline. But in health sciences, its share has
been below the global average. In comparison, Germany’s
national publication share in physical, life and health
sciences has been above the global average, but its
national publication share in engineering sciences has
been below the global average. To understand similarities
in research profiles of top 15 productive countries, the
research profiles of these top 15 countries were
categorised into the following four groups. The select
countries were later grouped and sub-grouped based on
the degree of similarity between their national publication
share in the following select broad subjects and the world
average publications share in the same broad subject:
(i)

Strong countries having national publication share
in the broad subject above the world average by 5 per
cent or more;

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(3)

(ii) Moderately strong countries having national
publication share in the broad subject above the world
average by 0.1 per cent to 4.99 per cent;
(iii) Moderately weak countries having national
publication share in the broad subject below the world
average below the world average by 0.1 per cent to
4.99 per cent;
(iv) Weak countries having national publication share in
the broad subject below the world average by 5.0 per
cent.
Seven countries—United States, United Kingdom,
Italy, Spain, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands share
strong-to-moderately strong similarities in life sciences
and health sciences, but they are weak in engineering
sciences. These countries were further categorised into
five sub-groups depending upon similarities in their
research profiles under the select subjects (Table 4).

Three countries—Japan, Germany and France, share
strong-to-moderately strong similarities in life sciences
and physical sciences, but these are weak in engineering
sciences. These countries were further categorised into
four sub-groups depending upon similarities in their
research profiles under the select subjects (Table 5).
Five countries—Russia, China, India, South Korea,
and Taiwan, share strong-to-moderately strong
similarities in physical sciences and engineering
sciences, but they are weak in health sciences. These
countries were further categorised into three sub-groups
depending upon similarities in their research profiles
under the select subjects (Table 6).

4.3 Subject-wise Profile of India and Germany
India and Germany differ in their subject priorities for
research as seen from national share of each in broad
disciplines—life sciences, health sciences, physical
sciences, and engineering sciences. For India, physical
science is the top priority area of research (41.23 per
cent), followed by life sciences (30.34 per cent),
engineering sciences (29.52 per cent), and health
sciences (21.6 per cent). For Germany, physical
sciences is the also top priority area of research (37.36

per cent), but unlike India it accords second priority to
health sciences (30.13 per cent), followed by life sciences
(29.98 per cent), and engineering sciences (23.72 per
cent).

4.3.1 Physical Sciences
Both India and Germany accord top priority to
physical sciences but individually, differ in terms of their
strengths in individual subject areas under physical
sciences (Table 7).
Physics and chemistry are the leading areas of
research in both India and Germany. The national shares
of India and Germany in these two leading subject areas
individually is two-to-three times greater than the output in
the other disciplines under physical sciences. However,
Germany is stronger compared to India in terms of global
publications share, international publications share, and
in the national publication share, and this applies to all the
subject areas under physical sciences—chemistry,
physics, environmental sciences, earth and planetary
sciences, and mathematics. Also, international
collaborative research activity of Germany in all
disciplines of physical sciences is growing at faster pace
than India’s.

4.3.2 Life Sciences
While India accords second priority to research in
life sciences, Germany accords it the third priority.
Individually India and Germany differ in terms of their
strengths in individual subject areas under life sciences
(Table 8).
Biochemistry, and genetics and molecular biology
are the leading areas of research in both India and
Germany in life sciences. In addition to biochemistry,
genetics and molecular biology, agricultural and biological
sciences are another leading area of research in India and
Germany. The national share of India and Germany in
these disciplines is at least two to three times greater
than in the other disciplines under life sciences. However,
Germany is stronger compared to India in terms of global

publications share, international publications share and in
the national publication share and it applies to all subject
areas in life sciences—agriculture and biological
sciences, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology,
pharmacy, toxicology and pharmaceutics, immunology
and microbiology, and neurology. Also, international
collaborative research activity of Germany in all the
disciplines of life sciences is growing at a faster pace
than India’s.

4.3.3 Engineering Sciences
While India accords third priority to research in
engineering sciences, Germany accords it the fourth and
last priority. Individually India and Germany differ in terms
of their strengths in individual subject areas under
engineering sciences (Table 9).

Engineering and materials science are the leading
areas of research in both India and Germany in
engineering sciences. The national share of India and
Germany individually in these disciplines is at least two to
three times greater than in the other disciplines under
engineering sciences. However, Germany is stronger
compared to India in terms of global publications share,
international publications share, and in the national
publication share, and it applies to all subject areas in
engineering—engineering, materials science, chemical
engineering, computer science, and energy. Also,
international collaborative research activity of Germany in
all engineering sciences disciplines is growing at a faster
pace than India’s.

4.3.4 Health Sciences
While India accords fourth and last priority to
research in health sciences, Germany accords it the
second priority. Individually, India and Germany differ in
terms of their strengths in individual subject areas under
engineering sciences (Table 10).
Medicine is the largest area of research in both India
and Germany in health sciences. India’s national share in
this subject area is at least nine times greater than in the
other disciplines under health sciences. However,
Germany is stronger compared to India in terms of global
publications share, international publications share and in
the national publication share and this applies to all
subject areas in health sciences—medicine, veterinary
science, health science, dentistry, and nursing.
Secondly, international collaborative research activity of
Germany in all engineering sciences disciplines is
growing at faster pace than India’s.
From the above analysis, it is clear that major fields
of national priority in India and Germany are medicine,
chemistry, physics, biochemistry, genetics and

molecular biology, engineering, and materials science. In
addition, agricultural and biological sciences are an area
of strength in India but not of Germany.

4.4 India and Germany: Strength and
Weakness
Although the raw number of papers provide a potent
indicator of scientific strength, it is often insightful to
analyse the country’s degree of specialisation in different
fields. Specialisation index was used to indicate that
when a country has a more important share of the world
scientific production in one field relative to its overall share
of world scientific production. The Table 11 presents the
specialisation index for India and Germany by field.
The important fields in which India has shown higher
specialisation are veterinary sciences (259.42),

specialisation, it is possible to immediately see that there
is a potential for collaboration between India and Germany
in physics, chemistry, materials sciences, earth and
planetary sciences, and mathematics—all fields where
both countries are specialised (Table 11).

4.5 SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION BETWEEN
INDIA AND GERMANY
Germany and India have a growing number of
scientific collaborations, which is reflected in the
Table 12. The average annual growth rate in international
collaborative papers between India and Germany is 10.75
per cent. The overall quality of the collaborative papers
was measured in terms of citation received in the first
three years after the publication. It was observed that the
overall quality of the collaborative papers between India
and Germany has increased from 4.49 during 1996-98 to
6.59 during 2004-06. Over 11 year period (1996-06)
covered by this study, the largest field of collaborations
between India and Germany was physics (with 2660
papers) followed by materials science (1061 papers),
chemistry (1005 papers), biochemistry, genetics and
molecular biology (818 papers), engineering (571 papers),
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(3)

agricultural and biological sciences (521 papers), etc. If
we normalise the collaborative research output data for
1996-98 and 2004-06 period, we find that the collaborative
output between India and Germany has increased to
maximum in medicine, followed by materials science,
chemical
engineering,
environmental
sciences,
biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology,
mathematics, chemistry, and engineering. As against
this, there was a decrease in collaboration activity in
public health, energy, earth and planetary science,
computer science, agricultural and biological sciences,
and physics (Table 12).

5. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
As seen from publications data on India and
Germany in the global context, both India and Germany
rank among top 15 productive countries in the world in

S&T. However, Germany leads India in terms of global
publications share even though India was able to achieve
faster publications growth rate of 7.2 per cent compared
to 3.96 per cent by Germany. Germany is stronger
compared to India in terms of global publications share in
all subject areas under physical sciences, life sciences,
engineering sciences, and health sciences. Germany
also leads India in its share of international publications in
all subject areas of science and technology. In addition,
international collaborative research activity is growing at a
faster pace in Germany than India.

medicine, chemistry, physics, biochemistry, genetics
and molecular biology, engineering, and materials
science. In addition, agricultural and biological science is
another area of strength in India but not Germany.
Both countries can plan fresh collaborative
programmes to strengthen research and development
especially in the subject areas of their strength and even
in other areas of mutual interest.

REFERENCES

Both, India and Germany, differ in terms of the
subject priorities for research except in physical
sciences. India accords top priority to physical sciences
followed by life sciences, engineering sciences, and
health sciences. For Germany, physical science is also
top priority area of research, but unlike India it accords
second priority to health sciences, life sciences, and
engineering sciences.
