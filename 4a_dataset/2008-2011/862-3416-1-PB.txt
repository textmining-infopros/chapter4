ABSTRACT
A disease-treatment ontology is being developed to model and represent treatment information found
in medical abstracts. Treatment information extracted from medical abstracts and medical articles can
then be encoded in this ontology and used for information retrieval, question-answering, summarisation
and knowledge discovery. This paper explains the initial version of the ontology developed based on an
analysis of 50 medical abstracts on colon cancer therapy retrieved from the Medline database. The
ontology divides disease-treatment information into five classes—disease, treatment, condition, effect,
and evidence. The sub-classes, properties and instances of these main classes are discussed with
examples.
Keywords: Medical ontology, disease-treatment ontology, ontology class

1. INTRODUCTION
A disease-treatment ontology is being developed to
model and represent treatment information found in the
abstracts of medical articles. This is part of a bigger
project to develop an automatic extraction system to
extract treatment information from medical abstracts
retrieved from the Medline database, to support
information retrieval, question-answering, summarisation,
and knowledge discovery. The purpose of the ontology is
to serve as a knowledge base to store the extracted
information and support these functions.
The ontology is also expected to be useful in
supporting synthesis of information extracted from
different publications, and inferencing of potentially new
relations between chemical substances and effects on
diseases, such as envisaged by Swanson1,2 and others.
Information stored in an ontology can also support
evidence-based medicine3,4—to alert doctors to the
range and quality of clinical data available to make
informed treatment decisions. A disease-treatment
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

ontology is potentially important for use in medical digital
libraries/portals and medical information systems.
The disease-treatment ontology is being constructed
as an enhancement to existing medical taxonomies and
ontologies. We adopted the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) semantic network5,6, the Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH)7, and the NCI (National Cancer
Institute) thesaurus (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/
ontologies/39478 & http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser)
as the base medical ontology and enriched with relations
to link potential medical treatments with diseases. The
following URI was assigned to the disease-treatment
ontology: http://dis.sci.ntu.edu.sg/medical/disease-treat
ment.v1#. The initial disease-treatment ontology was
developed based on analyses of 40 medical abstracts on
colon cancer therapy, and evaluation of additional 10
abstracts. Many definitions of ontologies have been
proposed in the literature from different perspectives.
Perhaps the most often quoted definition is by Gruber8:
“A body of formally represented knowledge is based on a
conceptualisation: the objects, concepts, and other
103

entities that are assumed to exist in some area of interest
and the relationships that hold among them9. A
conceptualisation is an abstract, simplified view of the
world that we wish to represent for some purpose. An
ontology
is
an
explicit
specification
of
a
conceptualisation.” In practice, an ontology is a set of
concepts or classes, represented by terms, linked with
semantic relations or properties. The most common
semantic relation is the isa or subclass-of relation that
organises the concepts into taxonomies with a
hierarchical structure. Additional semantic relations
enhance the ontology by specifying relations between
concepts in different taxonomies. More complex rules,
called axioms, specify constraints and relationships
among two or more concepts. The XML-based
representation formalism for ontologies adopted by the
World Wide Web Consortium is the Web Ontology
Language10. OWL offers three sub-languages of
increasing expressiveness: OWL Lite, OWL DL
(Description Logics) and OWL Full. In this study, we
adopted OWL DL as the knowledge representation
formalism and encoding scheme for the ontology. OWL
DL is said to provide “maximum expressiveness while
retainig computational completeness and decidability”10.
An ontology represented in OWL can be divided into two
parts: (i) the set of classes and properties (i.e. semantic
relations), and (ii) the set of instances (objects) of the
classes and instances of properties.
This paper describes the set of classes and
properties in the ontology. The instances would be
constructed from the information extracted from the
medical abstracts. However, some of the classes are
expected to be “closed classes” with a limited number of
instances. We are attempting to construct a
comprehensive list of instances for these closed classes.

2. CURRENT MEDICAL ONTOLOGIES
The majority of the literature on biomedical ontology
development and use is focused on gene ontologies,
particularly the Gene Ontology Project11,12, to annotate
genes, sequences, and gene expressions and functions.
Ontologies on other biomedical domains have been
developed for the following purposes:


For modelling biological systems. For example,
Antezana, et al.13 developed a cell-cycle ontology to
represent the cell cycle process and to support
analysis of cell cycle-related molecular network
components. Similarly, Matos14, et al. developed a
cell component ontology to support modelling of the
cell structure and properties of functional
components.



For supporting data or information management.
Min15, et al. developed a prostate cancer ontology to

104

support the management and integration of prostate
cancer clinical data. Stenzhorn16, et al. developed
an ontology of concepts related to cancer care and
research, to manage and integrate clinical trials
data. The ontology was used to support a clinical trial
management system.


For supporting a clinical decision support system.
Khoo and Na17 developed an ontology to represent
the knowledge-base for a clinical decision support
system for wound management. Kawazoe and Ohe18
developed an ontology for a clinical decision support
system that alerted doctors to adverse drug events.
The ontology was used to map clinical data to
domain concepts.



For supporting database searching. Mabotuwana
and Warren19 developed an ontology to support
identification of hypertension patients from an
electronic medical records system that matched
certain profiles indicating that their clinical
management could be improved. Bratsas20, et al.
developed an ontology to support fuzzy query
expansion in an information retrieval system for
medical computational problem solutions.



For specifying healthcare processes. Ye21, et al.
developed a clinical pathway ontology to support the
modelling and computerisation of clinical pathways
for patient care. Din, Abidi and Jafarpour22
developed a nursing care plan ontology to support
modelling of clinical practice guidelines and patientspecific care plans that can be computerised to
provide recommendations to nurses.



For mapping the concepts and knowledge in a
particular medical area. Haghighi23, et al. developed
a mood disorder ontology to survey the medical and
psychological approaches to mood disorders based
on an analysis of 5000 articles. Rosse and Mejino24
developed. The foundational model of anatomy
ontology—a spatial-structural ontology of the entities
and relations, which represent the structure of the
human body at different levels of granularity.

A search of the literature did not locate any generalpurpose disease-treatment ontology, especially one that
can represent information found in published medical
papers. However, some treatment-related semantic
relations are defined in the UMLS semantic network25 and
the NCI thesaurus (http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser).
The UMLS semantic network includes the following
semantic relations that can be used to indicate various
types of treatment effects: Affects, manages, treats,
disrupts,
complicates,
interacts_with,
prevents,
brings_about, produces, causes and result_of. The NCI
thesaurus also has several relations that indicate the
effect of drugs/treatment on diseases, including:

There are also relations linking type of surgery or



Procedure_Has_Excised_Anatomy



Procedure_Has_Completely_Excised_Anatomy



Procedure_Has_Partially_Excised_Anatomy



Procedure_May_Have_Excised_Anatomy

Some of the relations incorporate modality
indicators (e.g. “may have” and “partially”). However, the
NCI and UMLS relations are binary valued and relate a
treatment to a disease, but cannot model related details
of the treatment, disease, effect and research evidence.
Our focus is to develop an ontological structure that will
link related aspects of treatment and disease together.
Since the completion of this study, we have come across
the PhD thesis of Williams26 which reported the
development of a breast cancer ontology based on a set
of medical papers dealing with the treatment of invasive
breast cancer with Tamoxifen. Willims’ ontology focused
on the chracteristics of the disease and patient, and the
changes in various types of risks from the treatment. The
treatment regimes themselves were not modelled in
detail.

3. ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
METHODOLOGIES
Our disease-treatment ontology builds on existing
medical taxonomies and ontologies—the UMLS semantic
network, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the
NCI Thesaurus. The additional concepts and semantic
relations specified in the ontology will enrich the existing
medical ontologies by linking diseases with potential
medical treatments and representing additional details
related to the treatment administration and dosage, the
types of effects and the supporting research evidence.
Several methodologies have been proposed in the
literature for developing ontologies27, such as the Cyc
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

method28 Methontology29 and the On-To-Knowledge
method30 . However, most of these were designed for
solving particular difficulties in developing large-scale
ontologies, such as managing geographically distant
cooperative teams, easing enormous knowledge
acquisition, and merging/alignment of heterogeneous
ontologies27. These methods were not adopted for
developing our disease-treatment ontology, which is a
small-scale ontology. Ontology design remains partly an
art, regardless of the method used31.
The ontology was developed based on the saturation
principle32 . The basic idea is that a training set of
documents is used to build the ontology. Then a test set
is used to evaluate whether the ontology covers most of
the relevant concepts and relations in the domain. If new
concepts are found in the test set, the test set documents
is added to the training set and the new classes and
properties are added to the ontology. A second test set is
used to assess the ontology again, and the process
iterated until no new concepts are found.
For the current disease-treatment ontology, 40
abstracts were used as the training set, where important
concepts related to treatment were identified by manual
analysis. The specific concepts were then generalised to
derive broad classes and relations, which were likely to be
applicable across different medical domains. An
additional 10 abstracts as the test set were analysed in a
similar way to identify new treatment-related concepts
and relations not covered by the ontology. No new
concepts were found in the test set. However, additional
“instances” of concepts (e.g. particular drugs or
procedures) were found. Therefore, the 40 abstracts were
considered sufficient for developing a high-level diseasetreatment ontology for colon cancer. As an extension of
the current study, sample abstracts from the breast
cancer and heart disease domains are being analysed to
find out if the current ontology is sufficient.
The ontology development process was carried out
by the authors. Twenty-five abstracts were first analysed
jointly by all the authors, with the last 15 abstracts
analysed by one of the authors. All the classes and
properties were reviewed by the authors to ensure logical
consistency. Evaluation using the test set of 10 abstracts
was carried out by two of the authors. Admittedly, there is
some amount of subjectivity involved in developing an
ontology, and some design decisions were made.
Identification of challenges in developing such an ontology
and the design decisions that had to be made are
reported later.
The focus of the effort is to ensure that the ontology
covers most of the treatment concepts and relations
found in the abstracts, and is logical and principled (i.e.
follows certain design principles decided by the team).

4. TOP-LEVEL OF DISEASE-TREATMENT
ONTOLOGY
The top-level of the disease-treatment ontology is
shown in Fig. 1. Each square or node represents a class
or concept. Each directed arc or arrow represents a
property or relation. The top-class in the ontology is
Disease-Treatment which represents specific treatments
that are considered for a particular disease, as described
in medical articles. An instance of a Disease-Treatment is
not a specific treatment customised for a particular
patient’s condition, but a generic treatment that is
applicable to a group of patients with a similar disease
instance and condition.

hasDisease-> Disease

hasTreatment-> Treatment



hasEffect-> Effect

hasEvidence-> Evidence



name-> <character string>



rdfs:comment-> <character string>

hasPrimaryTreatment

hasSecondaryTreatment.

Currently no constraints are imposed on the number
of times each component can occur for a DiseaseTreatment. So a treatment may comprise a combination
of treatments (e.g. two drugs, or a drug and surgery) and
may be applied to a combination of diseases in a patient,
with multiple effects. There may also be multiple studies
(evidence) for this disease-treatment.
We now take a closer look at each of the top-level
classes of Disease-Treatment.

Information related to a Disease-Treatment is divided
into five aspects, represented by the following properties
and top-level classes:




5. THE DISEASE CLASS
The Disease class is specified as equivalentClass
to the Diseases class in MeSH. An instance of Disease
will be an instance of one of the sub-classes of MeSH
Diseases. Alternatively, we can import the Disease,
Disorder or Finding taxonomy from the NCI Thesaurus.
Instances of a Disease would have several properties,
depending on the type of disease. The list of properties of
the Disease class is given in Fig. 2. We have specified
some general properties that are applicable to many
types of diseases:

Condition refers to additional conditions or attributes
of the patient that may affect the efficacy of the treatment.
This includes the age and gender of the patient, medical
history, and other diseases the patient has. Evidence
refers to the research design and data reported in the
medical article that supports the Effect.

hasLocation->Anatomy– equivalent to the Anatomy
class in MeSH and the Anatomic Structure, System
or Substance class in the NCI Thesaurus



hasPhysicalFeature->Feature



hasDuration->TemporalQuantity



hasDiseaseModifier-> DiseaseModifier

The property hasPhysicalFeatures that can be subdivided into sub-properties to represent various types of
physical features, including hasSize-> Quantity. A list of
common physical features encountered in medical
abstracts is being constructed. It is expected that each
disease domain will have its own peculiar set of physical

In the OWL language, properties (i.e. relations) can
have sub-properties (sub-relations) to form a relation
hierarchy. We define two sub-properties for the
hasTreatment property to handle more complex
treatments:

features, as exemplified by the following text describing
colon polyps: “Polyps presented as sitting on a wide
pedicle (25), sprawling (19) or spreading flat (7) in rectum
(24), sigmoid (18) or colon (9). Polyp diameter ranged 1.01.9 cm (12 adenomas), 2-2.9 (18) or 3-5 cm (21).”
The Quantity class is used for all kinds of measures,
and have the properties quantityValue and quantityUnit,
e.g.
<Quantity>
<quantityValue rdf:datatype=”&xsd;float”>
59.5</quantityValue>

hasDiseaseModifier is adapted from the NCI
Thesaurus to indicate the severity and other nonphysical characteristics of the disease. We have defined
the
sub-properties
hasDiseaseStage
and
hasDiseaseSeverity. The NCI Thesaurus lists various
groups of disease modifiers including disease stage (e.g.
Stage III), disease morphology (e.g. malignant, invasive),
disease grade (e.g. low grade, poorly differentiated),
disease clinical (e.g. acute, secondary, recurrent,
chronic), disease gross finding (e.g. metastatic,
palpable), and disease treatment (e.g. resected,
unresectable), most of which have implications regarding
the severity of the disease.

<quantityUnit rdf:resource=”#Kilogram”/>

Specialised properties for specific types of diseases
need to be developed.

6. THE TREATMENT CLASS

TemporalQuantity is a specialised type of quantity
defined as a subclass of Quantity.

Figure 3 shows the properties defined for the
Treatment class. The Treatment class has the sub-

107

classes Therapeutics and SurgicalProcedures taken from
MeSH or from NCI Thesaurus—”Chemotherapy Regimen
or Agent Combination”, “Drug, Food, Chemical or
Biomedical Material”, “Gene”, and “Intervention or
Procedure”.
The Treatment class is associated with a property
that we call AdministrationScheme which is divided into
two components (i.e. properties):


hasFrequency->AdministrationFrequency–indicating
how often the treatment is administered, e.g. 3 times
a day, every 4 hours, exactly once, or whenever
needed).



hasDuration->AdministrationDuration–indicating
how many times or for how long the treatment is
administered, e.g. 10 days, or exactly once.



AdministrationScheme has two subclasses:



AdministrationCourse refers to one course of
treatment



AdministrationCycle refers to more complex
treatments where a course of treatment has to be
repeated for several cycles at regular intervals.

Thus AdministrationCourse refers to a local cycle
whereas AdministrationCycle refers to a global or higherlevel cycle. For example, in the text “one of the adjuvant
treatment schemes: 5-FU 450 mg/m2 and leucovorin 100
mg/m2 x 5 days every 4 weeks; six cycles” indicates an
AdministrationCourse once a day lasting 5 days, with an
AdministrationCycle of one course every 4 weeks lasting
6 cycles.
Additional properties are also specified for specific
sub-classes of Treatment. Two sub-classes of cancer
treatment are of particular interest:



SurgicalProcedure–equivalent to the Surgical
Procedures, Operative class in MeSH, or the
Surgical Procedure class in the NCI Thesaurus.



Drug, Food, Chemicals–equivalent to the Drug, Food,
Chemical or Biomedical Material class in the NCI
Thesaurus.



Additional properties defined for Drug, Food,
Chemicals are:



hasDosage->Dosage



hasAdministrationMethod->AdministrationMethod.

SurgicalProcedure
has
the
property:
hasMedicalDevice->MedicalDevices. The NCI Thesaurus
has a similar relation, Technique_Uses_Equipment, to
link an equipment to a technique
The example text “UFT 400 mg/day to be taken
orally”
indicates
a
Dosage
of
“400
mg”,
AdministrationFrequency of once a day, and
AdministrationMethod of “oral”. A list of 111 routes of
administration can be found in the CDER DATA
STANDARDS MANUAL (U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 2006).

7. THE EFFECT CLASS
The properties of the Effect class are shown in Fig.
4. The properties are:


hasMeasurementMethod->MeasurementMethod–
the method used for measuring the effect.



hasModality->Modality–the degree of confidence or
the truth value of the occurrence of the effect, i.e.
“possible”, “probable”, “unlikely”, “true”, and
“negation”.

Figure 4. Properties of the effect class.
108

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)



hasEffectObject->Object–the object that is affected.



hasObjectAttribute->ObjectAttribute–the
attribute of the object affected.

specific

The Effect class is also divided into a taxonomy of
sub-classes:


Effect



hasEffectType->EffectType–for example, “reduce”,
“inhibit”, “prevent”, and “remove”.



ComparisonEffect compares the effect of one
treatment with that of another



hasEffectValue->EffectValue–the direction and
extent of the effect. EffectValue has the properties
value, comparisonValue differenceValue and
percentDifference, which are linked to some
Quantity.



PatientEffect–the effect is expressed holistically
from the perspective of the patient, e.g. mortality, 5year survival rate, quality of life in the first
postoperative month, mental health, and minimal
follow-up period.



atTime->TemporalObject–to indicate when or how
long after treatment the effect occurs.





hasEvidence->Evidence to link to details of the
research study and research results.

DiseaseEffect–specifies the effect on the disease,
e.g. “the colon polyps were removed completely
through polypectomies.”



SideEffect–a secondary and usually adverse effect/
reaction/complication, e.g. “The majority of our
complications were bacterial infections, followed by
rejections and relaparotomies.”



AbsoluteTime refers to an absolute time point or a

examination (ReferenceEvent).



hasComparisonAspect->ComparisonAspect–
specifies the criterion on which the treatments are

Examples
(i.e.
instances)
of
ComparisonAspect includes safety, operating time,
hospital length of stay, and economic and
technological feasibility.

For example, in an article that compares
laparoscopic surgery with open surgery for rectal cancer,
the text “the mean operative time was significantly
increased in the laparoscopic group; however, this group
showed faster recovery of bowel function. Although
anastomotic leakage was comparable between 2 groups,
surgical wound infection was significantly higher in open
surgery group” indicates evaluation criteria of “operative
time”, “recovery” rate, “anastomotic leakage” and
“infection” during the comparison.

8. THE CONDITION CLASS
The Condition class has three sub-classes and one
property (Fig. 6):


PatientCondition refers to information on age, gender
and other personal attributes, and the patient’s
medical history. Personal attributes is equivalent to
the Personal Attributes class in the NCI thesaurus.



DiseaseCondition specifies other co-existing
diseases, e.g. “accompanied with colon ileus” and
“the neighbouring organs are affected.”
109

Figure 6. Properties of the condition class.




TreatmentCondition indicates the supportive/
optional/recommended medical environment prior to
or during the treatment, including treatment history,
e.g. “treatment applied after resection surgery” and
“in combination with surgery and chemotherapy.”

(5'-DFUR) therapy was performed as second-line
chemotherapy.” The following conditions are specified:

hasModality->Modality refers to modal modifiers such
as negation and possibility.

TreatmentCondition: TreatmentHistory “cecostomy” and
“chemotherapy with TS-1/cisplatin(CDDP)”.

For instance, the text “laparoscopic approach is only
contraindicated if the neighbouring organs are affected”
could be represented as an instance of DiseaseCondition,
i.e. “the neighbouring organs are affected” with Modality
“negation”. The following text serves as an example for
three kinds of conditions: “A 50-year-old man was
diagnosed with non-resectable scirrhous gastric cancer of
antrum accompanied with colon ileus due to direct
invasion of the transverse colon. As the ileus improved
after
cecostomy,

response, 4 cycles of paclitaxel (PTX)/doxifluridine

PatientCondition: Age “50 years”, gender “male”
DiseaseCondition: Co-existing disease “colon ileus”

The Evidence class has the following properties (Fig. 7):




hasResearchLocation->Location



hasResearchType->ResearchType e.g. systematic

10. CONCLUSION
We have described the initial version of the diseasetreatment ontology that we are developing to encode
treatment information reported in medical abstracts in the
Medline database. The ontology was developed from an
analysis of 40 abstract in the domain of colon cancer
therapy. A further 10 abstracts were used to verify that the
ontology is reasonably complete and can represent most
of the information related to colon cancer therapy. We
found that the ontology can cover all the types of
information (classes) associated with colon cancer
therapy in the 10 test abstracts. An example of a diseasetreatment instance extracted from a medical abstract and
represented using the ontology is given in the Appendix 1.
The ontology instance is presented in a template format,
rather than in OWL, for readability. Current work is
focused on constructing a comprehensive list of the
subclasses of the main classes and instances of the
closed classes. Closed classes are classes that have a
limited number of instances that can be enumerated
completely, e.g. Modality and EffectType.
The ontology is being extended to cover treatment of
two other domains—breast cancer and heart disease. It
was found that these two domains have different kinds of
treatments and the following additional treatment
concepts need to be added to the ontology: Radiation
Therapy (a subclass of cancer treatment and equivalent to
the Radiation Therapy class in the NCI Thesaurus),
hasProtein & gene expression status-> Protein & gene
expression status (a sub-property of hasDiseaseModifier).

Example of Disease-Treatment Information Extracted
from a Medical Abstract
PubMed Record No.: PMID-16367907
Citation: Inamine, M., et al. (2005). Inhibitory effect of dietary monoglucosylceramide 1-O-beta-glucosyl-N-2'hydroxyarachidoyl-4,8-sphingadienine on two different categories of colon preneoplastic lesions induced by 1,2dimethylhydrazine in F344 rats. Cancer Science, 96(12), 876-881.

Abstract: we evaluated the preventive efficacy of enriched dietary monoglucosylceramide 1-O-beta-glucosyl-N-2'hydroxyarachidoyl-4,8-sphingadienine (G(1)CM) on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and
beta-catenin-accumulated crypt (BCAC) formation in F344 rats during initiation stage. ... Pure G(1)CM was isolated from
rice bran. … Forty-two rats were divided randomly into five experimental groups. ... One week before the first injection of
DMH, rats in groups 2 and 3 were fed a diet containing 200 and 1,000 p.p.m. G(1)CM, respectively, for 5 weeks. … The
experiment was terminated 5 weeks after the start. Dietary G(1)CM at both doses (groups 2 and 3) significantly inhibited
the induction of ACF and BCAC (P<0.001) when compared to group 1 treated with DMH alone. In groups 2 and 3, the
proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling indices of epithelial cells in ACF and BCAC were also lower than in group 1
(P<0.0001 for ACF, P<0.05 for BCAC). These results, that dietary G(1)CM has possible chemopreventive effects in the
present short-term colon carcinogenesis bioassays, suggest that longer exposure may cause suppression of tumor
development.
Notes:
1. Two types of colon lesions are mentioned in the abstract. Each lesion would be represented as a separate diseasetreatment instance. However, they are placed together in this example for easy reading.
