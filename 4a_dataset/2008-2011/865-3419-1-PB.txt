1. INTRODUCTION
The PEC University of Technology (PEC) was
originally established as Mugalpura Engineering College
at Lahore (now in Pakistan) on 9 November 1921. The
name of the college was later changed to Maclogan
Engineering College and it started functioning under this
name from 19 March 1924. In 1931, the college migrated
to Punjab University, Lahore. After partition in 1947, the
college was shifted to Roorkee (India) and was renamed
as East Punjab College of Engineering. In 1950 the word
east was dropped and it came to be known by its present
name Punjab Engineering College. In December 1953, the
college shifted to its present campus in Chandigarh and
started functioning here from January 1954. In October
2003, the Government of India notified the Punjab
Engineering College as a deemed to be university.
Deemed to be university is a status of autonomy granted
to high performing institutes by University Grants
Commission (UGC). These are institutions, which are not
established as universities through legislations, but are
declared as deemed to be universities by the UGC, a
statutory body of the Government of India for the
coordination, determination and maintenance of
standards of university education in India. These
institutions enjoy the same academic status and
privileges as a university yet their organisational set-up
need not be the replica of a university. A Board of
136

Governors now manages the college. The college, in its
new set up, has introduced policies and programmes,
which are at par with those at IITs and other best
institutions in the world. Recently in June 2009, the
Institute switched over to its present name as PEC
University of Technology. PEC offers graduate,
postgraduate, and doctoral programmes in nine branches
of sciences and engineering. It is ranked at 19th position
amongst the top engineering institutions (both
government and private) in India for the year 2010-11
(Outlook India Survey) and at 6th position amongst the top
engineering colleges/institutions by CSR-GHRDC
Engineering College Survey 2010.
Published academic research outputs have for a long
time been used to appraise the credibility of faculty of any
institution and also have a profound impact on its ability to
deliver quality education. Present study focuses on
academic output of PEC faculty and research scholars,
consisting of the scholarly publications in the form of
technical articles published in various technical journals,
proceedings of the conferences/symposium ,etc. Few
earlier studies have been undertaken on the evaluation of
the research output of different institutions, both in India
(including of IIT, Kharagpur1-2, IIT, Roorkee3, University of
Mysore4, and Government Medical College and Hospital,
Chandigarh5). Studies had also been conducted at the
broader level, which includes evaluation of research at the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

group of institutes’ level6-7. Still broader studies are
available, which deals with evaluation of scientific activity,
including institutional activities8.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the present study are: (i) to
analyse the broad characteristics of PEC University of
Technology, Chandigarh publications, (ii) to study the
publication growth characteristics, format and media of
communication of PEC, (iii) to analyse the national and
international collaboration profile and major collaborating
institutions and countries, (iv) to analyse the overall
citation impact and the characters tics of highly cited
papers; (v) to study the distribution of its research output
and impact under broad subjects and under different
subject departments, (vi) to analyse the contribution and
impact of its most productive authors, and (vii) to compare
its contribution and impact with select similar
neighbouring engineering institutions.

3. METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCE
The present study analyses publications data from
1996 to 2009 for understanding the broad characteristics
and impact of research of PEC. The study derives
publications data for the study from Scopus international
multidisciplinary bibliographical database. For analysing
the subject scope, the total research output of PEC under
eleven subjects as defined by Scopus and under nine
subject departments.
For assessing the impact and quality of publications
output of PEC, three-year citation window was used. For
calculating the total international collaborative papers, a
separate search strategy, which combines India’s
collaboration with 140 major countries (Appendix I), was
prepared. For analysing authors and journals output, the
separate search strategies for generating institutional,
author and journal outputs were developed.

growth rate of 131.85 per cent. Growth in the academic
research output is seen after the PEC has acquired the
deemed university status. Contribution to engineering and
technology literature from this institute is steadily
increasing since then. It was 3 articles in 1996 and 27 in
2009. But the international collaborative research activity
in the university is still very small, accounting for just 6.21
per cent share. Also as compared to the neighboring NITs/
engineering institutions, the research output of PEC
needs to be substantially improved. There is intense
requirement to develop suitable research environment and
upgrading infrastructural facilities.
Some of the suggestions to develop appropriate
management strategies to attain the objective of increasing
the impact of PEC academic research output are:


There is need to explore new opportunities for
collaborative research with all the countries from the

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

developed and developing world especially in the
emerging areas of research in engineering and
technology.


Faculty should be encouraged to do research
projects in collaboration of institutions of higher
learning and industrial research laboratories in India,
which will give them the vital exposure to the workculture and state-of-the-art facilities available with
such institutions.



Channelising and attracting research support from
external faculty and to develop multi-disciplinary
research departments.



Draw short term and long term plans for future
research endeavours.
