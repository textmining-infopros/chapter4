ABSTRACT
Ministries of Government of India have hosted their own websites across the World Wide Web so as
to provide the world a view of the functioning of the Indian Government. It is essential these have to be up
to the mark to represent the nation in an appropriate manner. But, despite this scale of involvement, there has
been relatively little analysis of contents and visibility of these websites. This study highlights the importance
of online government information in India and shows how far these websites have been able to make an impact
on the society. The paper aims to examine the websites for their linking and content presence, and also to
find out their web impact factor. The research methodology adopted for the study is investigative in nature.
It includes observation of the selected websites from different points of view like number of webpages, web
impact factor, and number of rich files. Data analyses and interpretation show that for each of the indicator
used in this study, there were a different set of websites which achieved the topmost ranks. The findings
of this study highlights the standing of these websites against the average values and show that different
ministries excelled from different points of view.
Keywords: Government of India, websites, webometrics, web impact factor

1. INTRODUCTION
Information is required at national level to give support
to the nation in economic development, in social
development as well as in management and decision
making. Information is considered to be vital for the
development of individual, society and as such of nation.
Information is important to obtain, store, process, retrieve
and display the right information for the right decision.
With the advent of Internet and Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), it has become
essential for every government body to host a website. By
having a website, a government body can have maximum
impact over a large number of people employing minimum
resources and time. Therefore, it is indispensible for the
government to host an impactful website of their own.
Apart from this, a website allows a government body to
bring all its information together, even if its sub-bodies are
placed at geographically dispersed places. Thus,
inclusion of ICT within government bodies can bring about
development of government itself.
The government acquires and disseminates
information in practically every field of governance and for
understanding of the national issues.1 Though the

government publications perform these duties with
extensive coverage, yet these remain unidentified by
users, for whom they are majorly created. The
Government of India has gone in for hosting its information
on the web so that it becomes more accessible to users.
As the government activities have increased
tremendously, so has the volume and diversity of
information generated by it. The Government of India has
emerged as a vital group engaged in generating,
collecting, and disseminating information in the country.

2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The Government of India consists of three major
organs. These are: Legislative (Parliament including Lok
Sabha and Rajya Sabha), Executive (Central Ministries
and Departments), and Judiciary (Supreme Court, High
Court, and District Courts). The ministries, being an
integral part of the government, have to be such that they
represent the nation in an upright manner. Many
ministries have their own websites to provide a view of
functioning of the government. But, despite the scale of
involvement, there has been relatively little analysis of
contents and visibility of their websites. This brings us to
an unavoidable stand wherein an analysis of the linking
3

and visibility of these websites has become extremely
vital. The present study was carried out to examine the
linking on websites of Central Ministries under the
Government of India and to find out their web impact factor
(WIF) and amount of information present on these
websites in the form of rich files.

3. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
The executive organ of the Government of India
presently consists of 48 ministries, but only 41 have their
own website2. Remaining seven are depicted via websites
of their departments. Websites of ministries only were
considered for this study and not those of their
departments. These were excluded due to the
comprehensiveness of the already selected Central
Ministries. The 41 websites selected for this study were.

4. METHODOLOGY
The methods, used to assess information content
provided on the Internet, utilise various criteria to review
the information presented on the websites. These criteria
range from accuracy to availability of the content and its
quality to quantity. The research methodology adopted for
present study was investigative in nature. It included
observation of selected websites from different points of
view like number of webpages, WIF and number of rich
files. This methodology included:


Online searching.



Calculation of WIF.



Finding number of rich files.



Data analyses and interpretation.

5. WEBOMETRICS
Being a global information network, initially
developed for scholarly use as mentioned and now
inhabited by a diversity of users, the web constitutes an
obvious research field for bibliometrics, scientometrics,
and informetrics. Webometrics is the quantitative
analysis of web phenomena, drawing upon informetric
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(4)

methods, and typically addressing problems related to
bibliometrics. Webometrics was triggered by the
realisation that the web is an enormous information
repository The web has its own citation indexes in the
form of commercial search engines useful for
researchers to exploit. One of the most visible outputs of
webometrics is the ranking of world universities based
upon their websites and online impact.
Björneborn and Ingwersen3 used an information
science-related definition of webometrics as “the study of
the quantitative aspects of the construction and use of
information resources, structures and technologies on the
WWW drawing on bibliometric and informetric
approaches”.
This definition thus covers quantitative aspects of both
the construction and usage sides of the web embracing
the four main areas of webometric research and also
encompasses hybrid forms like webpage content
analysis, link structure analysis, usage analysis, etc.

6. INDICATORS USED
The indicators used in this study comply with the
quantitative aspect of the links and information being
provided on a website. These indicators4 are:
(i)

Size (Number of webpages): This includes webpages
coming under a domain, and being indexed by the
search engine. A strong web presence attracts new
links and citations worldwide. This data, however, only
provides an insight into quantitative aspect of
information on the website and not the quality. Thus,
for more rigorous results, other indicators have been
used.

(ii) Visibility (Total number of inlinks): The number of
unique inlinks received by a domain is a measure that
represents visibility and impact of the published
material, and although there is a great diversity of
motivations for linking, a significant fraction works in a
similar way as bibliographic citation.
(iii) Web Impact Factor (Number of inlinks/Number of
webpages)5: WIF was proposed by Almind and
Ingwersen6 and was inspired by the Journal Impact
Factor as its acceptable implication in web-based
environment. WIF is a measure of the frequency with
which a webpage of a website is linked at a given point
in time. A higher WIF represents greater reputation of
a website.
(iv) Rich Files: Number of webpages supporting different
file formats, like Portable Document Format (.pdf),
Microsoft Word (.doc), and Microsoft PowerPoint
(.ppt). The success of self-archiving and other
repositories related initiatives can be roughly
represented by this data.

7. DATA ANALYSIS
Analysis of data was related to information provided
by ministries of Government of India on their websites. A
comparative analysis of data with regard to the presence
of information was studied, and its visibility on web was
calculated. The number of webpages along with rich files
was also examined. Thereafter, interpretations were made
based on the analyses.

7.1 Weblink Analysis
The web is a dynamic platform to host information.
This is thus a snapshot study conducted in the time
window of three months, for the purpose of webometric
analysis. The data was collected month-wise over a
period of three months (i.e., March-May 2009) so as to
generalise the reliability of the data during this time. Also,
if the data is collected over a large period of time, it results
in extremities in the behaviour of a website which makes it
difficult to generalise it.
Table 1 gives number of webpages and number of
inlinks for websites in alphabetical listing of the selected
ministries. It shows that among all ministries, EA had the
highest number of webpages while PR had the lowest
number of webpages. From ‘inlink’ columns in Table 1, it
was seen that in the first month of data collection FIN had
highest number of inlinks followed by EA in April and RAIL
in May. ES had the lowest number inlinks for the first two
months of data collection followed by H&UD, which
replaced it in the third month. Table 1 also shows that in
some of the ministries the number of webpages is
decreasing. This may be ascertained by the fact that
along with addition of information on a website, it is
extremely essential to remove the webpages having
obsolete and thus trivial information to maintain the
worthiness of a website. This also helps in efficient
searching for updated information on the website.

7.2

Web Impact Factor

The calculation of WIF requires number of webpages
and number of inlinks to a website (given in Table 1).
Table 2 shows the WIF for selected ministries. The last
column in Table 2 gives average of three months for ease
of ranking. It shows that YA&S had the highest impact on
web with far more the number of inlinks as compared to
the number of webpages on its website. It was followed by
HA while RAIL came next, which also exceeded WIF
value of YA&S in the last month.

7.3 Rich Files
The rich files require corresponding softwares for
viewing. These readers are mostly the ones who are
widely used all across the world, or can be downloaded
from the link given alongside the links to the file itself.

Also, many of the files were provided in different formats
so that the user can access the file in desired format. The
comprehensive file-type-wise data regarding the number
of rich files has been displayed in Table 3 in a month-wise
manner for March, April and May 2009.
Health and Family Welfare ranked first in all months of
data collection. Ministry of Railways came second but
only in the first month. The second place was taken by
RD in the later two months. In the last two months of data
collection, RAIL came at number three. Thus, H&FW
hosted highest number of rich files on its website. It
bypassed, by a large margin, the RAIL, which was
followed by the RD at the third place on average. Also,
number of .pdf files exceeded the number of .doc and .ppt
files which were not adequate for almost all the ministries.

8.2 Web Impact Factor
Ministry of Youth Affairs &Sports ranked number one
in its impact on web with far more number of inlinks as
compared to number of webpages on its website. It leads
with a WIF of 5.70 followed by HA at the second position
with a WIF of 4.6 and RAIL with a WIF of 3.3. WIF
accounts for the visibility of a website on the web.

8. FINDINGS
For the each indicator used in this study, there were a
clearly different set of websites of the ministries, which
achieved the topmost ranks. Thus, different ministries
excelled from different point of view. There was a ministry
with as high as 21916 webpages, and a ministry with a
WIF as strong as 6.84. On the other hand there was a
ministry with lowest number of webpages at 35 only, and
a WIF of 0.06. Then, there was a ministry with a total of
11500 rich files, and contrastingly there was one with only
15 files. Thus, the websites of the selected ministries
proved to be a bag of mixed beans where all variety,
ranging from highest to the lowest, can be found.

8.1 Webpages and Inlinks
On average, EA hosted the highest number of webpages
on the web followed by HRD and H&FW. Also, FIN ranked
second followed closely by FPI, where as RAIL took the
first position with an average number of 22279 inlinks.
Figure 1 depicts that only a quarter or 10 selected
ministries have above average number of webpages on its
website. With the total average of 3309 number of
webpages per website, majority of miniseries fall below
even that average.

on the

A total average WIF was 1.30, which is not considered
satisfactory. Considering the importance of websites, this
value should have been high. But, due to lack of internetworking among government websites themselves, this
value is not yet agreeable. Figure 2 shows that in meeting
average value, WIF is better than the number of
webpages. Around 32 per cent of the ministries had above
average WIF while 68 per cent still remain below it.

8.3 Rich Files
Health and Family Welfare hosts the highest average of
rich files on its website, i.e., 10589. It is separated by a
huge margin from RAIL which is then closely followed by
RD with an average of 4936 files. Figure 3 shows that only
a small percentage of websites meet the required average
of hosting rich files on websites. This was also not
satisfactory with a whooping 78 per cent of websites
coming below average.

(iv) The ministries also have to do a lot in field of
publicising themselves on web, to attain a greater
number of hits from its users.
(v) If website is visited more often, it would lead to
fulfilling of the third law of library science, i.e. “Every
book, its reader” or rather “All information, its user”.

10. CONCLUSION

Figure 4.

Category-wise distribution of ministry websites
of rich files.

Figure 4 shows that a chief portion of the rich files
hosted by the websites consist of .pdf files. While, .doc
files have its share with 11 per cent .ppt staggers behind
with a measly 1 per cent. Also, none of the ministries host
an equal number of all types of rich files.

9. SUGGESTIONS
On the basis of findings, the following suggestions are
recommended for improvement of the websites of the
ministries covered in this study:

From the study, it can be concluded that EA ranked in
the first position with respect to number of webpages
among the various selected ministries. EA also lead all
the ministries with maximum webpages in a single month
which no other ministry could achieve during the course of
this study. YA&S lead WIF ranking. The ministry had
highest number of inlinks with respect to its webpages.
This ministry also managed to grab a second highest WIF
in a single month from all the WIF values analysed in this
study, the first being RAIL for the same month. H&FW
was ranked on the top for presence of rich files. It also
boasted the fact that no other ministry was able to match
even its lowest value during the 3 months of data
collection.

The websites of some ministries like PR and YA&S
with minimum number of webpages should increase
webpages indexed by the search engines, so that it
becomes easier for the surfer to get access to the
