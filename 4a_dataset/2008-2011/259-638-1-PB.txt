ABSTRACT
This study aims to focus on growth pattern as well as overall trend in literature output on retina during
2002-2007. Secondary data collection from a set of retrieved bibliographic records from the literature output
in the field of retina from the CD-ROM sources of MEDLINE was studied. The results indicate variability in the
authorship pattern, and English language as the major medium in literature output for retina. The contribution
of the USA is higher in this subject also in comparison of other countries of the world. The paper also highlights
the need of more research in retina-related research.
Keywords: Scientometrics, MEDLINE, retina, retina information sources, retina disorders, retina publication
productivity, MEDLINE database

1. INTRODUCTION



Retinal detachment

The scientometric analysis gained momentum in the
recent years due to proliferation in science literature1.
Scientrometri is the measurement that helps in identifying
the progress of a particular science subject2. This paper
highlights the growth pattern of literature on retina over a
period of six years (2002-2007) to testify the current
developments in the subject and to focus on its structure.
Studies like this will be helpful to understand the complex
nature of the research in a particular subject, and to
provide adequate facilities and guidance in which direction
the future research has to be carried out3.

3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY


To identify the authorship pattern of the literature



To study the structures/forms such as monographs,
journal articles, newsletters and other types of the
literature



To identify the journals and their countries of origin
where the literature on retina has been published



To study the language-wise distribution of the
literature

2. THE RETINA
The retina forms a thin neural sheet at the back of the
eye. It is approximately 100-200 µm thick and represents
a triumph of miniaturisation4. Light coming into the eye
passes through the clear cornea, lens, and vitreous gel
before reaching the retina, which helps us to see things
and living organisms. Diseases of the retina5 include many
disorders affecting the body as a whole, and others
limited only to the eye. Some of the common disorders of
retina include:


Diabetic retinopathy



Retinal tears



Age-related muscular degeneration

4. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The MEDLARS database for 2002-2007 was
analysed for this study. About 150 records on retina were
downloaded from MEDLARS for the study. Though the
database comprises about 36 fields, the following fields
were downloaded for each record on retina literature:
33

5.2 Country-wise Distribution of Authors

(i) title; (ii) author; (iii) address; (iv) source and pages of
occurrence; (v) year of publication; (vi) language;
(vii) country of publication; and (viii) publication type.

The analysis of country-wise distribution of authors is
an essential phenomenon to understand the progress of
research on a particular field of study in a country7, 8.
Table 2 indicates that the United States ranked first with
33 records followed by China and Japan with 17 records
each, and Germany and Australia with 15 and 13 records,
respectively. India, England, and France have an equal
output of 12 records each; Pakistan and Omen four; and
Thailand seven records, respectively. Other courtiers like
Philippines and Kuwait contributed three and one record,
respectively.

5. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATIONS
5.1 Authorship Pattern
The characteristics of any literature include not only
the basic publishing patterns but also that of the
authorship pattern6. Table 1 shows the authorship pattern
on retina conducted during this study. The analysis
reveals that authorship pattern on retina ranges from
single (10 papers) to 17 authors (2 papers). Maximum
numbers of papers (26) were authored by three persons.

5.3 Language-wise Distribution of the
Literature

Table 1 shows that the research on retina is being
pursued as a group collaborative activity rather than the
solo research activity.

Table 3 presents language-wise distribution of the
literature. It is clear from the Table 3 that the English is the

predominant medium for the authors for publishing their
research. Chinese language found three records over the
period of study followed by French, Japanese, Spanish,
and German with single record. Contributions in
languages form many tropical and sub-tropical regions
were confusing by their absence.

Table 4 presents the different forms of retina
literature. Out of 150 records 118 were published in the
form of Journal articles followed by report (25). Reviews
and letter constituted a total of six and one items,
respectively.

5.5 Major Sources for Retina Literature
Publications
Table 5 presents major sources for retina literature
output. American J. Medicine and Ophthalmologe covered
12 articles each. Table 5 shows that only two Indian
journals, Indian J. Med. Res. and Indian J. Pediatr.
published one article each during the period under study.

6. CONCLUSION
It is to note that Indian research productivityon retina
literature is less though UNESCO has identified India as
the country which may have most retinal disorders. The
reasons for low contributions by the Indian authors may
be due to lack of well-developed laboratory environment in
many hospitals for ophthalmology research. Study also
found that according to major health database
MEDLARS, over a period of six years only 150 records on

36

retina were published worldwide. This warrants more
developments/research in this field.
