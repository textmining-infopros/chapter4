ABSTRACT
Information technology (IT) has thrown a new challenge to the libraries. The technology has shown a
great impact on the services of the libraries. Libraries use IT for better services and satisfying diverse user
needs. Libraries have transformed into digital and virtual libraries where books, journals, and magazines have
changed into e-books, e-journals, and e-zines. This has increased the global dissemination of information.
Electronic resources (e-resources) are easily accessible in the remote areas. The e-resources solve storage
problems and control the flood of information. Print sources are being digitised. There is a great need to study
the use of e-resources and investigate the factors that are a hindrance to their use. The present study is
an attempt to examine the usage of electronic resources at Dr T.P.M. Library, Madurai Kamaraj University. Study
revealed that MPhil students respondents took the first position in their overall methods of searching eresources, postgraduate student respondents the second position, PhD Scholar respondents the last position.
The study confirmed that respondents were aware of the e-resources and various types of e-resources,
e-database, and e-journals. The study recommended the improvement in the access facilities with high internet
speed and subscription to more e-resources at Dr T.P.M. Library, Madurai Kamaraj University.
Keywords: Internet, e-resources, CD-ROM, e-journals, e-books, search engines, library portals, UGC-Infonet

1. INTRODUCTION
The internet provides access to unlimited sources of
information and search engines are continuously being
advanced to provide efficient ways to help users to find
what they want. The internet eases and increases access
to a large amount of data, saves time and money, and
provides an opportunity to consult several experts with a
single request (via discussion groups), and more
independence from specific times and places for
information seeking. Technology has penetrated all areas
of life. Libraries use information technology (IT) for better
services and satisfying diverse users’ needs. Libraries
have transformed into digital and virtual libraries where
books, journals, and magazines have changed into
e-books, e-journals, and e-zines. This has increased the
global dissemination of information. Electronic resources
(e-resources) are easily accessible in the remote areas.
The e-resources solve storage problems and thus control
the flood of information.
Today we are living in the age of information. The
information is a dynamic and unending resource that
Received on 10 February 2011; Revised on 15 April 2011

affects all disciplines and walks of life. Over the last
decade, electronic resources have become increasingly
substantial components of academic library collection.
This is due to the continuous development of IT and its
impact on library collection development policies due to
changing demand of users for the pin-pointed and
exhaustive information within a short time. With the
growing popularity of e-resources, the traditional libraries
are gradually migrating from print documents to
e-resources where providing access to information is
considered more important than owning it. This has
compelled libraries to rethink about their collection
development functioning.
Applications
of
information
communication
technology (ICT) in libraries have provided enough
opportunities for e-resource development and
disseminate it in the manner that their users preferred.
Among e-resources, the e-journals and e-books are more
in demand by the users.
The quality of higher education in India requires
ongoing changes and developments in the teaching437

learning process. Faculty members in universities need to
let go the concept of merely text-book-oriented lecturing
system in the changing higher education environment.
The countries with advanced education systems
developed extensive teaching/learning strategies,
planned to train their students for a wider market place,
through lectures, seminars, workshops, handouts, and
web-based tutorials. The faculty in India must identify and
use new teaching strategies designed to support the
teaching, learning, and research goals of the university.
The further inducements for such a change have been the
explosion and proliferation of information in various
formats, changing patterns of information seeking and
retrieving, hence the need for investigating internet usage
in this changing higher education environment. This is the
first attempt to study the use of internet and e-resources
by the university student and research scholars. Its
findings should help the University in drawing its plans
and programmes related to e-learning and strengthen
pertinent resources and services of its libraries.
The present study is an attempt to analyse the use of
e-resources by the PhD scholars, MPhil and
Postgraduate (PG) students of Madurai Kamaraj
University and to find out the problems and constraints
faced by the users in accessing the e-resources with
some purposeful suggestions for their development.

2. HISTORY OF DR T.P.M. LIBRARY, MADURAI
KAMARAJ UNIVERSITY

growing needs of the new born university, the authorities
decided to shift to a new venue named Palkalainagar near
Vadapalanji village, on the Theni Main Road. The new
building was declared open on 20 November 1973 by Thiru
V.R. Nedunchezhiyan, the then Pro-chancellor of the
University. The total cost of the building and furniture
came up approx. to Rs. 14,04,251. The library was
constructed with the financial assistance of the UGC and
the Government of Tamil Nadu. The University Library was
shifted from the old campus at Tallakulam to
Palkalainagar and it started functioning in the new
building from 3 April 1974. It is called Dr T.P.
Meenakshisundaran Library.

3. OBJECTIVES
Availability and access of e-resources (both online
and offline) have become an integral part of any modern
library. The basic objectives of the present study are to:

•

Analyse the purpose of using e-resources by
respondents

•

Examine the respondents’ duration and quantum of
time utilisation in search of information

•

Know different types of e-resources commonly used
by respondents

•

Analyse the methods used by respondents in
accessing e-resources

•

Find out the preference of respondents in using
various categories of e-resources

•

Identify the problems faced by respondents in using
the e-resources

Until 1967, there was only the University of Madras,
Tamil Nadu, besides the Annamalai University - a privately
funded one. It was Dr A. Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar who
thought of a Postgraduate Centre of the University of
Madras, down south. The Postgraduate Centre of the
University of Madras was started on 15th December 1957
in the premises of American College at Madurai. Dr S.J.
Savarirayan, Principal of the American College was
Incharge of this Centre. The occasion was marked with
the establishment of a small library with Prof S.
Gnanamuthu as the Librarian, who later became the first
University Librarian. On 2nd February 1957, Dr C.P.
Ramaswamy Aiyar laid the foundation stone for a new
library building at the N.M.R. Subbaraman Park. The
building was inaugurated by Dr C.D. Deshmukh, the then
Chairman of the University Grants Commission on 16th
October 1961.

To review the literature, search was conducted with
combination of various key terms such as ‘e-resources’,
‘e-journals’ and ‘e-journals consortia’ in Library and
Information Science Abstracts (LISA), Emerald
database, EBSCO database, Science Direct and other
databases, including search on the e-journals websites
and search engines. In addition searches, bibliographies
journals were also reviewed for more sources, as well as
website of UGC-Infonet digital library consortium and
many eminent experts were consulted in the field of
e-journals.

In view of the growing number of colleges in the
southern districts encircling Madurai as an academic
pivotal point, the Government of Tamil Nadu pronounced
the opening of a University, bifurcating from the University
of Madras. That was the Madurai University that came
into being on 1st February 1966. The University of Madras
Extension Centre Library was renamed as the Madurai
University Library. The city complex could not cater to the

The e-resources are invaluable research tools which
complement print-based resources in any traditional
library. The e-resources provide access to information that
might be restricted to the users because of geographical
locations or finances. These also provide access to
current information as these are often updated frequently.
Through their various search techniques, e-resources
provide extensive links to explore additional resources or

related content. In addition, e-resources are convenient to
use since users are able to access information from the
library, cyber cafes or in the comfort of their homes during
any time of the day.
Aldojan1 investigated the internet use among
education faculty members in Jordanian public
universities. The population of this study included the
entire education faculty members (309) in seven
Jordanian public universities, ranking instructors/
lecturers, assistants, associates, and full professors. The
study explored about no. of times types of internet tools
used on a daily basis, and the degree of satisfaction of
education faculty members in Jordanian public
universities using the internet in their academic work. The
purpose of this study was to collect and analyse the data
to determine the patterns of internet use and to identify
the faculty’s concerns and its overall degree of
satisfaction of its services.
Ali2 highlighted the use of electronic information
services (EIS) among the users of Indian Institute of
Technology (IIT) Delhi library. Data was collected from 300
IIT Delhi library users. Results revealed that 95 per cent of
the users had awareness about EIS provided by the
library.
Biradar3, et al. reported the results of a study
exploring university students’ and teachers’ use of search
engines for retrieval of scholarly information. The main
objectives were to examine the use of search engines,
use of popular search engines, factors influencing for
search engines’ use, use of search strategy for
information retrieval and also to know the methods of
learning search strategy by students and faculty in the
university environment. Results of the study showed that
100 per cent of the students and 97.91 per cent of the
faculty used search engines for retrieval of information on
the internet. Google and Yahoo received the highest
overall ratings. The study revealed that majority of the
respondents took help from their friends and used help
messages of search engines to learn the search strategy.
Dadzie4 investigated the use of e-resources by
students and faculty of Asheshi University, Ghana, to
determine the level of use, the type of information
accessed and the effectiveness of the library’s
communication tools for information research and
problems faced in using e-resources. Results indicate
that 85 per cent of respondents used the internet to
access information, and that respondents mainly
accessed information in the library by browsing books on
the shelves.
A doctoral study by Fortin5 explored faculty members’
use and their information seeking behaviours and
activities on the internet at Angelo State University. Using
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)

both quantitative and qualitative methodologies,
differences were found between tenured and tenure-track
faculty members on the perceived value of the internet to
meet their research and classroom information needs.
Similar differences were also found among faculty
members in the broad discipline areas of the humanities,
social sciences, and sciences. Tenure-track faculty
members reported a higher average internet use per week
than tenured faculty members.
Adika6 analysed internet use among faculty members
of universities in Ghana. Research results showed that in
spite of the benefits of the internet, its use among faculty
was still very low. The main reasons for this were the lack
of access to the internet and the need for training. It was
suggested that university authorities must take
immediate steps to provide general access points to
faculty through computer laboratories. Here, librarians,
information professionals, and computer scientists have
vital roles to play in organising training and refresher
sessions for faculty in getting up-to-date information via
Internet for teaching and research.
Al-Ansari7 conducted a study on internet use by the
faculty members of Kuwait University. This study was
designed to investigate the patterns of internet use by
faculty including purposes of use, its impact on teaching
and research, internet resources used, and the problems
faced while using the internet. A structured questionnaire
was used to collect data from the faculty of four colleges
of Kuwait University, i.e., arts, social sciences, sciences,
and engineering. The study revealed that the internet was
mostly used for communication, research, and
publication for saving time, to find up-to-date information,
and to cooperate with their colleagues. Slow speed, lack
of time, and lack of access from home were some of the
major problems.
Majid & Abazova8 explored the use of e-resources
relevant to computer literacy among academic staff of the
International Islamic University, Malaysia. Nearly all
respondents considered themselves to have good or very
good computer skills.
Madusudhan9 focused on the use of e-resources by
research scholars of Kurukshetra University. The main
aim was to determine the use of e-resources, users’ skills
in handling e-resources, and the purposes of their use.
Further, the paper aimed to highlight the problems faced
by research scholars in accessing e-resources, their
opinions on features of e-resources and their views on
usefulness of e-resources compared to those of
conventional sources. The findings showed that
e-resources have become an integral part of the
information needs of research scholars at Kurukshetra
University. Further, it was found that e-resources could be
good substitutes for conventional resources, if the access
becomes fast and more computer terminals could be
439

installed to provide fast access to e-resources. Google
wasthe most widely used search engine for locating
information electronically.
Rehman & Ramzy10 investigated the awareness and
use of electronic information resources among health
academics. Results shosw that libraries were extensively
used for research needs, preparation of lectures, and for
obtaining current knowledge. Lack of time was the main
reason given for not using electronic resources (37 %).
Unfamiliarity with computerised searching came next
(22.6 %).
Chirra & Madhusudhan11 analysed use of e-journals by
doctoral research scholars of Goa University, India. The
e-journals have become vital part of information for
research work. This study could help in knowing the
importance and use of e-journals in comparison to printed
journals, particularly by the research community. Most of
the respondents were accessing e-journals from the
department computer labs for their research work and ejournals could meet the instant desire of users to have an
access to information.
Springer and Kluwer is the leading publisher. Boolean
Search is the most popular advance search technique.
The study showed that there was a need for user
orientation for efficient searching of e-journals. The most
common problem faced by the respondents was that
there was difficulty in accessing full text and many of the
respondents were not satisfied with the internet facilities
available in Goa University and they had provided some
constructive suggestions for improving the accessing of ejournals.
Shuling12 analysed the use of e-resources in Shaanxi
University of Science and Technology. The sample
consisted of 909 respondents of all types of library users.
The study found that nearly 80 per cent of respondents
knew little about e-resources. Nearly half of the
respondents use both printed and electronic resources,
followed by print periodicals.
Agarwal & Dave13 have studied the use of internet by
the scientists and research fellows of Central Arid Zone
Research Institute, Jodhpur (Rajasthan). Assessment
was done on the basis of the results of a questionnaire
survey in CAZRI, Jodhpur. Further, they also attempted to
assess the frequency of use, location, search engine,
purpose of use, etc. The study revealed that the
respondents accessed Google search frequently (100 %)
followed by Yahoo (85.29 %).
It was also observed that equally (97.06 %)
respondents used the internet for education and research.
The respondents strongly desired that the library should
initiate various functions and services like e-portals,
online information, abstracts retrieval along with providing
access to internet.

5. METHODOLOGY
To fulfill the objectives of the study, a structured
questionnaire covering relevant aspects of the study was
distributed among the PhD scholars, MPhil and PG
students of Madurai Kamaraj University of 2009 batch.
Further, random sampling techniques were used for
distribution of questionnaire as it was not possible to
collect data from all the target respondents under the
scope of the study. Besides in some cases, personal
interactions, verifications of records were made to get first
hand information. The questionnaire was prepared in such
a way that the respondents could easily understand the
items. Total 300 questionnaires were distributed randomly
among the PhD scholars, MPhil and PG students. The
investigator could collect questionnaires from only 260
out of 300 respondents. This constitutes 86.66 per cent
(260/300) of the total response.

6. DATA ANALYSIS
Analysis of data is the ultimate step in a research
process. It is the link between raw data and significant
results, leading to conclusions. This process of analysis
has to be result-oriented.

6.1 Population Study
The attitude and use of library resources of users
varies among them. Realising the importance of this, the
respondents of the present study have been grouped into
different categories for the convenience of the study. The
analysis of data in Table 1 shows that out of 260
respondents, maximum numbers of respondents, i.e.,
152 representing 58.46 per cent of total respondents,
were PG students. It was followed by 62 respondents
(23.85 %) were MPhil students, and 46 respondents
(17.69 %) are PhD scholars.

Realising the importance of computer knowledge to
access e-resources, data revealed that all respondents
were computer literate and had possess basic knowledge
on computers and other IT tools. Further attempts were
made to know about the degree of knowledge of
respondents which has been tabulated in Table 3 which
depicts that according to their own assessment one-third
of the respondents in all the categories (29.23 %) had
excellent knowledge of computer and IT tools. It was
followed by average knowledge (27.69 %), good
knowledge (23.84 %) and poor knowledge (19.24 %) by
respondents.

6.3 Frequency of Library Visits
The frequency of library visits by the users is usually
influenced by factors such as collection, organisation,
and maintenance of the library resources along with the
library resources, facilities and the library services.
To ascertain the frequency and purpose of library visit
by respondents, data were collected and has been
presented in Table 4. The analysis of data in Table 4
shows that, amongst PhD scholars, one-third of the
respondents visit library almost daily, i.e., 16 (34.79 %),
followed by 12 (26.08 %) twice a week, 10 (21.74 %) once
a week and 8 (17.39 %) thrice a week. Among the MPhil
students, one-third of the respondents visits library almost
daily 19 (30.64 %), followed by thrice a week 18

(29.05 %), once in a week 15(24.19 %) and twice a week
10 (16.14 %). Among PG students, maximum
respondents visited library almost daily 52 (34.21 %),
followed by thrice a week 48 (31.57 %), twice a week 30
(19.74 %) and once a week 22 (14.48 %). However,
irrespective of categories, one-third of the respondents 87
(33.46 %) visited library almost daily.

6.4 Preference in Using Print over E-resources
The use of e-resources is increasing day-by-day due
to the advantages associated with it such as copying,
storing, multiple search facilities, etc. To find out if
preference of respondents in using e-resources over print
resources, collected data have been tabulated in Table 5.
The analysis of data 5 showed that all the three
categories of respondents preferrd e-resources than print
resources. Further among the respondents, in the PhD
category, the preference was more, i.e., 16 (34.78 %)
and 14 (30.44 %) for e-resources and print resources
respectively, whereas among MPhil respondents, it was
12 (19.36 %) and 24 (38.70 %) and among PG students
it was 48 (31.57 %) and 62 (40.79 %). Also as per
analysis of data, 16 (34.78 %) of PhD respondents, 26
(41.94 %) of MPhil students and 42 (27.64 %) of PG
students preferred both print and e-resources. However,
irrespective of categories, maximum respondents 100
(38.47 %) preferred e-resources.

6.5 Purpose of Using E-resources
The e-resources are used for various purposes, such
as for study, research, publication, e-journals, e-books,
career information, entertainment, etc., which also differs
from user to user. The data collected also have been
summarised in Table 6. A study of data in Table 6
indicates the category-wise respondents’ purposes of
using e-resources. The category-wise analysis examined
the following:
•

•

•

The PhD scholar respondents occupied the first
position with respect to their overall purpose of using
e-resources as their secured mean score was 3.35 on
a 5 point rating scale.
The MPhil student respondents took the second
position in their overall purpose of using e-resources
as their secured mean score was 3.16 on a 5-point
rating scale.
The PG student respondents ranked the last position
in their overall purpose of using e-resources as their
secured mean score was 2.99 on a 5-point rating
scale.

6.6 Sources of E-resources Used
The e-resources available in the library are basically
the subscribed online resources through UGC-Infonet

consortium, online resources freely available on internet
and open access journals/books and the offline
e-resources in the form of CDs/DVDs. A study of data in
Table 7 indicates the category-wise respondents’ sources
of e-resources used. The category-wise analysis
examined the following:

•

The PhD scholar respondents occupied the first
position w.r.t their overall sources of e-resources used
as their secured mean score was 3.39 on a 5 point
rating scale.

•

The MPhil student respondents took the second
position in their overall sources of e-resources used
as their secured mean score was 3.32 on a 5-point
rating scale.

•

The PG student respondents ranked in the last
position with mean score was 3.18 on a 5-point rating
scale.

6.7 Methods of Searching E-resources
The e-resources can be searched in different ways,
such as through websites of online databases/journals/
publishers, search engines, subject gateways, library
portals, etc. The study made an attempt to know the
methods adopt by the respondents to search e-resources
and the result has been analysed in Table 8. Table 8

6.8 Frequency of E-resources Used
The frequency of e-resources used by the respondents
as revealed from the analysis of Table 9 is mostly daily 72
(27.69 %) followed by once a month 67 (25.77 %), once a
week 63 (24.24 %) and when they desire 58 (22.30 %).
However, irrespective of categories, maximum respondents
72 (27.69%) used e-resources daily.

6.9 Problems Faced in Accessing E-resources
There are various problems associated with the
access of e-resources by users. Realising its importance,
the study attempted to collect data on this and data as
presented in Table 10 which indicates the category-wise
respondents’ problems in accessing e-resources. It can
be assessed with the help of 7 factors on a 5-point rating
scale. These includes power failure, slow accessibility,
lack of IT knowledge, limited access to computers, lack of
time, virus problem and poor personal assistance. The

maximum respondents were highly satisfied on the
access of e-resources in library, i.e., 102 (39.23 %). It
was followed by other responses such as moderately
satisfied 58 (22.30 %), satisfied 56 (21.54 %), dissatisfied
26 (10.00 %) and highly dissatisfied 18 (6.93 %). However,
irrespective of categories, nearly half of the respondents
102 (39.23 %) were highly satisfied on the access of eresources.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings of the study, the following
recommendations are made for the effective use of eresources by the users of Dr T.P.M. Library, Madurai
Kamaraj University.

•

The LIS professionals of the Central Library have to
spread more awareness on e-resources. In this
context the website of library, and newsletter of the
Institution should highlight the available e-resources
in the library regularly.

•

Higher speeds Wi-Fi campus needs to be developed
by Central Library, so that users can use online eresources and internet within the campus according
to their convenience.

•

Besides e-journals and e-database, e-books and
other e-resources (both online and offline) should be
acquired by the Central Library.

•

The speed of internet needs to be increased for quick
access to the available e-resources.

•

Qualified IT experts should be made available to solve
the problems of networking and hardware.

•

Besides UGC-Infonet consortium, e-resources as per
the need of the users need to be subscribed from
publishers, vendors, etc. Accordingly more funds
should be diverted from the library budget towards eresources.

•

The Central Library needs to arrange various
users’orientation and training programmes for faculty
members for the optimum use of available eresources, and also subscribe database. Also,
product trials of various e-resources for specific user
groups need to be introduced.

•

444

Basic training in hardware and software such as MS
Office, internet searching, and use of e-resources should
be included in the curriculum of each department.

8. CONCLUSIONS
The e-resources are the best means of getting current
and up-to-date information. The library environment has
currently undergone drastic changes in terms of
collections and services. The proliferation of e-resources
has had a significant impact on the way the academic
community uses, stores, and preserves information. The
advantages of e-resources have drawn attention of the
library users to a great extent. Accordingly, these
resources have occupied a significant place in the
collection and budget of almost all libraries. Research
scholars’ attitude seem to be very positive towards eresources for their study and research and the role of
libraries as gateways to provide assistance in accessing
these resources. The study shows that e-resources have
radical impact on the changing higher education
environment. It is interesting that e-resources usage
among postgraduate students, MPhil students and PhD
research scholars at the Dr T.P.M. Library, Madurai
Kamaraj University is much more than expected. It is
broadly used for teaching and research purposes.
This study has highlighted that MPhil student
respondents tare at first position in their overall methods
of searching e-resources, PG student respondents at the
second position, PhD scholar respondents the last
position. This study also indicates that PG student
respondents took the first position in their overall
problems in accessing e-resources, MPhil student
respondents the second, PhD scholar respondents, the
last position.
The use of electronic information sources for study
and research purposes must be encouraged and proper
training should be organised from time to time. This is the
first comprehensive study of the use of e-resources by the
students and research scholars. It is hoped that its
findings would help the University and its libraries in
framing its policies and programmes related to
e-resources to facilitate teaching and research.
