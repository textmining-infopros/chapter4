1. INTRODUCTION
The Indian information industry is undoubtdly
acknowledged as an important player in world. The
availability of technical human capital, proficiency in
English, cost competitiveness, quality-training institutes,
and favourable government reforms have laid solid
foundations of the information industry and well-sought
destination of global companies to outsource their
businesses. India’s most priced resource is its readily
available technical workforce. It is estimated that India
has over 4 million technical workers and over 1832
educational institutes and polytechnics, which train
more than 67,785 computer software professionals every
year1.
The Indian information technology (IT) industry has
played a key role in putting India on the global map.
Thanks to the success of the IT industry, India is now a
power to reckon with. The IT industry may be subdivided into: (i) IT services, (ii) ITES services (ITES-BPO
services), and (iii) e-commerce. According to the
Department of Information Technology, (DIT),
Government of India (GoI), the overall revenue from
Indian software and service industry is estimated to have
grown from US$10.2 billion during 2001-02 to US$58.7
billion during 2008-09, translating to a CAGR of 26.9 per

cent. The export intensity (the share of IT-ITES revenue)
of Indian software and services industry has grown from
74.5 per cent during 2001-02 to 78.9 per cent in 200809.The total software and services exports are estimated
to have grown from US$7.6 billion to US$46.3 billion
during 2008-09, a CAGR of 28.6 per cent2.

1.1 Government Initiatives
A number of infrastructures and other policy
initiatives had been taken by the GoI to develop and
promote IT as an important engine of economic growth.
The National Informatics Centre (NIC) was established in
1975, followed by Computer Maintenance Corporation
(CMC) Ltd in October 1976.
During 1986-1997, the GoI embarked upon the
creation of the following wide-area networks schemes:
(i)

INDONET (intended to serve IBM mainframes in
India).

(ii) NICNET (the network for India’s National Informatics
Centre).
(iii) ERNET (the academic research oriented network
education and research network).

In 1991, the Department of Electronics created a
corporation called Software Technology Parks of India
(STPI) to provide VSAT communication without
breaching its monopoly. STPI set up software
development parks in different cities to provide satellite
links to firms. The Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL)
introduced Gateway Electronic Mail Services in 1991,
64 kbit/s leased line service and a commercial Internet
access on a visible scale in 1992. A new ministry,
namely, Ministry of Information Technology, was
established in October 1999, which was re-christened
as Ministry of Communication and Information
Technology in September 2001 given the increasing
convergence between communication technology and
information technology3.
The government under Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee
placed the development of information technology among
its top five priorities, and formed the National Taskforce
on Information Technology and Software Development,
under the Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission in
May 1998 with the objective of framing a long-term
National IT Policy for the country. Within 90 days of its
establishment, the taskforce produced an extensive
report, in three parts, on the state of technology in India
and its IT action plan with 108 recommendations. The
reports finally become a solid base for the present policy
development to built India’s infotech industry to
proliferate the use of IT in the country. The New Telecom
Policy, 1999 (NTP, 1999) helped further liberalise India’s
telecommunication sector3.
The GoI enacted the Information Technology Act in
2000, which provides a legal framework to facilitate ecommerce and electronic transactions. The government
approved the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)
comprising 27 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) and eight
components on 18 May 2006, which played an important
role in increasing Internet penetration in rural India. The
State governments are also enunciating their IT policies.
Many States are now vying with each other to develop
their own brands of Silicon Valleys as hubs of IT
activities.

1.2 R&D Efforts
The R&D in computer science is undertaken by
academic institutions, government-sponsored R&D
institutions, and industry-sponsored institutions4. Among
the academic institutions, the major role has been
played by Indian Institute of Science; Bengaluru; Indian
Institute of Technology (IITs); Indian Statistical Institute,
Kolkata; National Institute of Technology (NITs); Indian
Institute of Information Technology (IIITs); engineering
colleges with deemed university status; universities with
engineering and technology faculty; and government and
40

private engineering colleges. The R&D work is
undertaken in several R&D institutions under various
research departments and agencies of Ministry of
Information and Communication Technology (MoICT),
Department of Electronics (DoE), Department of Atomic
Energy (DAE), Department of Space (DoS), Defence
Research and Development Organisation (DRDO),
Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR),
Department of Science and Technology (DST), etc. In
addition extra-mural funding has been provided to
academic and research institutions in computer science
by agencies such as Ministry of Human Resource
Development (MHRD), All Indian Council of Technical
Education (AICTE), University Grants Commission
(UGC), MICT, DoE, DAE, DoS, DRDO, DST, CSIR, etc.
from time to time. Among the industry-sponsored
research, the major R&D work in computer science in
India is undertaken by Indian companies such as Tata
Consultancy
Services
(TCS),
Tata
Research
Development Design Centre, Infosys Technologies,
Wipro Technologies, HCL, etc., and foreign companies,
such as Texas Instruments, IBM Research Centre, GE
Research Centre, Motorla Inc., Oracle, Intell
Corporation, Mocrosoft, Dell, and CISCO Systems Inc.,
etc.

1.3 Professional Bodies
Few professional associations and bodies such as
National Association for Software and Service
Companies (NASSCOM), Manufacturer’s Association of
Information Technology (MAIT), the Institution of
Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers (IETE),
Computer Society of India (CSI) and Indian Association
for Research in Computing Science (IARCS) have come
up in the country for promotion of education, research
and business promotion activities in IT.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Among the few quantitative studies on computer
science carried out in India, Das and Kranzai5 analysed
the major Indian institutions publications on computer
science as covered in Science Citation Index (SCI)
database during 1991-2000. Gupta and Dhawan6 studied
computer science publications authored by Indian
scholars as covered in INSPEC Database during 19942001, with a focus on publication output and impact
factor quality, areas of strength and weakness, and
contribution of leading institutions and individual
scholars. Suresh and Garg7 analysed Indian computer
science publications of Indian and Chinese scholars as
covered in specialised bibliographies during 1971-2000,
in terms of local and international journals, impact factor
range and coverage in SCI versus non-SCI covered
journals, the extent of collaboration, etc.

3. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this study was to analyse the
research performance of India in computer science
research across 11 major sub-fields, as reflected in their
publication output during 1999-2008. In particular, the
study focuses on the publication growth, international
collaboration share, publication productivity and impact
of leading institutions and authors, the patterns of
research communication and the characteristics of highcited papers.

4. METHODOLOGIES AND SOURCE OF DATA
This study is based on the Indian publication data in
computer science retrieved from the Scopus Citation
Database for 10 years (1999-2008). Three-year citations
window was used for counting the citations received and
to access the impact of Indian research output, Indian
institutions and authors, and international-collaborative
publications.
The Scopus classified the entire S&T literature
under four broad fields (physical, life, engineering and
health sciences) and 20 narrow fields including
computer science. The study is limited to the literature
covered under computer science. There is an
overlapping of journal coverage under the 20 narrow
subject fields. The authors have identified 11 sub-fields
using a keyword strategy (Appendix 1).
The process used for keywords selection was as
follows. First a general query on Indian computer
science research during 1999-2008 using the following
search strategy was made: “affil (india) and pubyear aft
1998 and pubyear bef 2009 and [limit-to (subjarea,
“comp”)]”. This query additionally generated a set of 160
leading keywords with the frequency of their occurrence
varying from 133 to 2195.
Then the Indian computer science experts were
consulted for choosing the most important keywords
relevant to the 11 sub-fields defined. The list of keywords
generated from the database was sent to 50 Indian
experts with a request to relate these keywords to these
11 sub-fields and to suggest new keywords not existing
in the list of keywords sent. On the basis of experts’
advice, the keywords relevant to the 11 sub-fields were
finalised.

as 1592. The cumulative publications output of India
increased from 3315 publications to 12609 publications
from 1999-03 to 2004-08 witnessing a growth of 280.36
per cent. India’s annual average publication growth rate
during 1999-2008 was 28.68 per cent. In terms of impact
and quality, the average citations per paper registered by
India’s publications output during 1999-06 were 2.10.

cent share), computer theory (504 publications, 3.17 per
cent share), Internet and multi-media (499 publications,
3.13 per cent share), computer architecture (284
publications, 1.78 per cent share), and operating
systems (169 publications, 1.06 per cent share). Out of
11 sub-fields identified above, only 3 sub-fields
witnessed increase in their activities from 1999-03 to
2004-08 as reflected in their activity index: computer
networks (from 72.65 to 107.19), software engineering
(from 89.37 to 102.79), and operating systems (93.80 to
101.63). While in the remaining, there is a relative
decline in publication activity.
In terms of growth from 1999-03 to 2004-08, the
maximum growth rate (783.33 per cent) was registered
by cryptology, followed by Internet and multimedia
(557.07 per cent), computer networks (461.17 per cent),
software engineering (337.5 per cent), operating
systems (312.12 per cent), computer theory (266.67 per

during 1999-08, the maximum (52) was registered by
computer software, followed by computer networks (43),
artificial intelligence (40.5), Internet and multimedia (31),
database management system (23), computer hardware
(18), computer theory (17), software engineering (16),
computer architecture (15), operating systems (10), and
cryptology (9.5). In terms of share of international
collaborative publications during 1999-08, the maximum
(29.22 per cent) wasregistered by computer
architecture, followed by artificial intelligence (23.94 per
cent), operating systems (23.08 per cent), database
management system (23.08 per cent), computer
hardware (22.75 per cent), computer theory (19.84 per
cent), computer software (19.33 per cent), software
engineering (18.80 per cent), and cryptology (14.12
per cent).
The impact and quality of research output under
various sub-fields was also studied in terms of citations
received on the three-year citations window during 199908. The maximum impact (4.41) was made by Internet
and multimedia, followed by computer hardware (2.54),
artificial intelligence (2.07), computer software (2.06),
database management system (1.90), computer

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(6)

architecture (1.76), computer theory (1.45), computer
networks (1.39), cryptology (1.33), software engineering
(1.24), and operating systems (1.08). In terms of change
in citation impact from 1999-03 to 2004-08, the subfields, which have improved their impact were: Internet
and multimedia (from 3.99 to 4.68) and computer
architecture (from 1.70 to 1.83). In all other fields, the
impact has gone down from 1999-03 to 2004-08:
computer theory (from 1.89 to 1.34), software
engineering (from 2.04 to 1.06), database management
(from 2.86 to 1.59), artificial intelligence (from 3.09 to
1.79), computer networks (from 3.12 to 1.08), computer
software (from 3.08 to 1.77), operating system (from 2.0
to 0.85), computer hardware (from 3.35 to 2.27), and
cryptology (from 2.11 to 1.24). India’s strength and
weakness as reflected in the analysis of 11 sub-fields of
computer science gives valuable clues to Indian policy
makers to plan for future research strategies, and to
funding agencies to plan resource allocation in specific
areas of national and global interests, which may be
more crucial for future development of IT industry in
India.
