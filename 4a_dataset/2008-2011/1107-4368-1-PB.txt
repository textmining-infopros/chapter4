ABSTRACT
The study aims to test content-based document recommender system (CODORS) with sample data to
retrieve most relevant technical documents without necessarily matching title terms and closely related to particular
search term(s). The CODORS system was put open for users to search and obtain recommendations with weighted
relevance ranking and also allowed to compare the results obtained through general OPAC search engine for the
same keywords. Based on the findings of the experimental testing and evaluation, some conclusions have been
drawn:The results exhibited that the CODORS search provided many more relevant documents and increased the
recall value as compared to general OPAC search and also revealed documents that were retrieved for a given
query through OPAC search appeared at different places-top, middle or end of the ranked list of documents generated through the CODORS search for the same query.
Keywords:

Recommender systems, content-based
information retrieval, document retrieval

1. THE RESEARCH PROBLEM
The need for enhancing the recall value of the
results retrieved motivated the researcher to search for a
technique that would retrieve more documents for a given
query, particularly grey literature on aerospace. Some
retrieval models generally rank retrieved documents as
relevant to the query according to some criteria and such
models are called as ranking models1. The study of
advances made in IR systems, more particularly retrieval
models such as Boolean model, vector space model, and
probabilistic retrieval models, showed not only the
possibility of retrieving more relevant documents for a
given query, but also ranking of these documents so as to
facilitate the user to select the relevant documents based
on the objectivity. It also provided a cut-off point in case if
large number of relevant documents were retrieved. With
this aim in mind, the authors chose the research problem
entitled,
"Designing
Content-based
Document
Recommender System for aerospace grey literature".
The authors, hence, developed a test-bed database
of grey literature on aerospace engineering using 'Dialog
OnDisc Aerospace Database' brought out by American

Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) for this
purpose. Further, the authors developed a recommender
system
known
as
Content-based
Document
Recommender System (CODORS)2 using Boolean
operators. The recommender system so developed was
put to test using the above database and results of
CODORS searches were compared with the retrieved
output of the normal OPAC searches. The major issues of
concern in designing this recommender system were: to
increase the search capability and to get ranked list of
documents retrieved by automatically assigning
weightage to each document retrieved.

2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The objectives of the study are:


To understand and to assess the capability of general
OPAC to retrieve grey literature relevant to scientists
working in the field of aerospace engineering and
allied sciences.



To design CODORS using first order descriptors in
aerospace engineering and allied sciences based
275

on individual user search words (profiles) to
facilitate easy access to and optimum utilisation of
relevant information in the form of grey literature.

S7: Calculation of "Boosting Factor" with the help of
highest ranked document from CODORS results and
adding to every document in the results.

3. HYPOTHESIS

S8: Displaying the documents retrieved at Step S7 on the
basis of decreasing order of relevance.

Although the objectives of the study are clear, there
were chances that the study may deviate from the track
as the research progresses. Hence, it was necessary to
have a hypothesis running through the objectives. For the
present study, the following hypothesis was formulated:

5. SYSTEM TESTING WITH SAMPLE SEARCH
QUERIES

H+: Use of CODORS as compared to general OPAC
searches results in retrieving comprehensive, highly
relevant and ranked documents in the field of aerospace
engineering and allied sciences.

4. METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY
The study adopted was the experimental testing and
user opinion surveys. It began with the development of
bibliographic database of papers of conference
proceedings relevant in the field of aerospace
engineering and allied sciences. Titles of the conference
papers and associated descriptors were considered
essential for the study. As the efficiency and accuracy of
the system to be developed depended solely on the
suitable descriptors representing the thought content of
the documents, the descriptors assigned in the source,
i.e., Dialog OnDisc Aerospace Database were used as
these descriptors were assigned using NASA thesaurus.
The next step was the development of CODORS using
‘first-order descriptors’. The steps involved in the
development of CODORS are described.

Exercising formal testing of information retrieval
systems was carried out initially in Cranfield experiments
in early 1960s. The aim of Cranfield research was to find
ways to improve the retrieval effectiveness of IR systems
through better indexing languages and methods3. For
performance comparisons, quantitative measures used in
the Cranfield II experiments were recall and precision,
which are the derivative of the concept of relevance4. A
series of IR experiments were conducted on the SMART
system by Gerald Salton5,6. A series of experiments,
known as TREC (Text TEtrieval Conference), were started
in 1992 and were considered as real experimental
approach to information retrieval evaluation.
Having designed the CODORS recommender
system, it was put to test. As many as 124 search tests
were conducted using different key terms ranging from
broader to narrower subject fields in the area of aerospace
engineering. The hit results of general OPAC searches
and CODORS searches were studied, tabulated, and
compared to assess the usefulness of CODORS.
Detailed search queries and results obtained using
normal OPAC and CODORS are shown in Appendix 1.

S1: Extraction of individual search words (terms)
entered by the users.

6. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS WITH SAMPLE
SEARCH QUERIES

S2: Retrieval of titles of all documents having all the
search words (terms) entered by the users.

The findings of the experiments conducted on the
test database using CODORS recommender system in
actual environment are summarised here under:

S3: Retrieval of all descriptors that are assigned to all
documents retrieved at step S2.

(i)

S4: Formulation of weighted vector of descriptors as it is
the base of user profile. The elements of the vector
are termed as 'first-order descriptors'. Weights for
the descriptors are calculated based on number of
occurrences of individual descriptors with reference
to total number of descriptors retrieved at step S3.

General OPAC search could retrieve documents
ranging between 2 to 10 for a given query. The search
under CODORS system retrieved 10-500 documents
and even more for a given query. It, however, depends
on the subject area of the query. That means the
recall value of the searches under CODORS is found
to be much greater compared to that of general
OPAC searches.

S5: Mining of all documents titles from the database,
which are having at least any one of the 'First Order
Descriptors' retrieved at step S3.

(ii) The CODORS searches provided ranking of all the
documents retrieved and this ranking is based on the
weightages of the document relevance for a given
query.

S6: With the help of matching descriptors, calculation of
the percentage weightage of each document retrived
at step S5.

(iii) In the ranking order, majority of the documents
retrieved from the general OPAC are normally placed

either somewhere in the top, middle or in the end of
the ranked list of documents which means many
more relevant documents are left un-retrieved, in case
of simple OPAC search.

7. OPINION SURVEY OF USERS ON CODORS
The questionnaire is an importa survey technique for
gathering data from users during recommender system
evaluation experiments. Questionnaire is structured
research instrument which is used to collect research
data in a face-to-face interview, self-completion survey,
telephone interview or Web survey. It consists of a series
of questions, which may be in form, on interview schedule
on paper, or on a webpage7.
The system was thrown open to the users to enable
them to use CODORS searches and thereby test the
usability of this recommender system in actual
environment. The scientists were provided URLs of both
general OPAC and CODORS on Intranet of Defence
Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) and
requested to search their required information relating to
grey literature. To assess and confirm the usability of the
recommender system-CODORS-in actual environment an
opinion survey of users was conducted through structured
questionnaire. As many as 27 questions relating to
various aspects of information search including use of
OPAC and CODORS were provided in the questionnaire
(Appendix 2).
The questionnaire comprised closed questions that
provide a fixed set of responses with which users must
respond such as more relevant, most relevant and not
relevant, etc. The questionnaire was distributed to 150
scientists and technocrats who are the regular users of
the library. All the 150 users responded to the
questionnaire. These questionnaires have been tabulated,
analysed and results have been reported in succeeding
sections.

respondents mentioned that they are familiar with
OPACs, 71 (47.33per cent) respondents said that they
are very familiar with OPACs and 1 (00.67per cent)
respondent stated that he is not very familiar with OPACs.

8.2 Relevance of Documents Retrieved Using
Simple OPAC
Opinions of users about the relevance of documents
retrieved through OPAC searches were collected under 5
options as shown in Table 2. Table 2 depicts that 86
(57.33 per cent) respondents mentioned that the results
are relevant between 50-74 per cent, 60 (40 per cent)

cent) respondents the hit results were as expected
by them.

(vi) For 72 respondents representing 48 per cent of the
total, the retrieved documents were relevant between
51-75 per cent, for 66 (44 per cent) users the
relevancy of documents ranging between 76-99 per
cent, for 11 (7.33 per cent) users the relevancy was
between 26-50 per cent and for 1 (0.67 per cent) user
the relevancy of documents retrieved was 100 per

(ix) All (100 per cent) users have been convinced with
display of percentage relevance ranking of the results
of CODORS search.
(x) All (100 per cent) users expressed that CODORS is
useful for finding relevant documents on the subject
of their interest.
(xi) All (100 per cent) users opined that CODORS results
on the subject of their interest were comprehensive.

cent of the total experienced that they could get hit
results from CODORS search through the key terms
they used which did not match with terms in the titles
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(4)

(xiv) All users (100 per cent) searched information using
CODORS keeping in mind its highest relevance. In all
such cases all (100 per cent) users experienced
search output of not only those documents in mind
but also additional documents.
(xv) One hundred forty-eight out of 150, representing
98.67 per cent of the total respondents expressed
that they obtained documents ranked higher than
that of the one they had considered more relevant.
Among these 148 users who obtained higher ranking
documents, 89 (59.33 per cent) expressed that such
documents were more relevant, 59 (39.33 per cent)
said they were most relevant and only 2 (1.33 per
cent) expressed that there was not much difference
in the relevance between the documents ranked
higher and the document they considered most
relevant.

10. CONCLUSIONS
Designed CODORS converts the terms expressed
by the user in natural language automatically into subject
descriptors, carry on search, rank documents and
retrieve. The document ranking is automatically done by
the system on the basis of weightages calculated based
on the occurrences of number of subject descriptors,
which are assigned to each title of the document in the
collection. The results are sorted on relative relevance
ranking and are presented to the user for maximum
utilization of technical resources that are otherwise
hidden in the database collection.
The CODORS was put to test by conducting
repeated searches using variety of descriptors/key terms
relating to general and specialized subject areas in the
field of aerospace engineering. The results exhibited that
the CODORS search provided many more relevant
documents and increased the recall value as compared
to general OPAC search. It also revealed those
documents that were retrieved for a given query through
OPAC search appeared at different places - top, middle,
or end of the ranked list of documents generated through
the CODORS search for the same query. The system
having put for use in the actual environment revealed the
encouraging results. The results of the opinion survey
covering 150 regular users of DRDL library correlated
with the results of the experimental test and found highest
281

usability as it provided not only expected relevant
documents but also more relevant documents giving
