ABSTRACT
The electronic resources (e-resources) available in a library play a prominent role in facilitating access
to required information to the users in an easy and expeditious manner. The e-resources, like CD-ROM databases,
online journals, online books, OPACs, and the internet, are slowly replacing the importance and usage of print
media. A study of 11 degree colleges in Chandigarh, which have students and teachers strength of over
30000, was conducted. For the purpose of the study, a sample selected was 770 which included 60 students
and 10 teachers from each of the colleges, respectively. The objectives of this study was to know the usage
of e-resources and services by the users of degree college libraries in Chandigarh; find out the impediments
encountered by the users while accessing and using the e-resources; and suggest measures to take full
advantage of IT to make degree college libraries more digitally resourceful and for providing information
services data from the usersteachers and studentsto know the impact of e-resources. The data collected
was analysed using simple percentage technique.
Keywords: Electronic resources, bibliometric study, accessing e-resources

1. INTRODUCTION
Information and communication technology (ICT) has
revolutionised every walk of human society. Large scale
computerisation, invention of the internet and influx of
world wide web has made extensive and fast
dissemination of information and turned the world into a
global village. Academic libraries have a long history,
starting with the chained and closed-access libraries of
earlier times to the present-day hybrid, digital, and virtual
libraries that use the latest technology for provision of
information through various services. Today, these
libraries are surrounded by networked data that is
connected to vast ocean of the internet-based services to
make desired information sources accessible to the
academic communitystudents and the faculty alike.
The electronic resources (e-resources) available in a
library play a prominent role in facilitating access to
required information to the users in an easy and
expeditious manner. The e-resources, like CD-ROM
databases, online journals, online books, OPACs, and
the internet, are slowly replacing the importance and
usage of print media. It is imperative that one should be
familiar with the use and exploitation of e-resources for

their quick and effective usage for promotion of academic
excellence and research.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
A number of sources have been consulted and the
content was gone through to identify the related studies
on the present topic of research. Some of the studies
relevant to the present survey are:
Dillon1 discussed that understanding the factors that
influence user acceptance of information technology (IT)
was of interest both to researchers in a variety of fields as
well as procurers of technology for large organisations. It
was concluded that current research offers insights that
could support the derivation of reliable predictions of user
acceptance.
Hiller2 discussed that the University of Washington
libraries has conducted triennial faculty and student
library surveys since 1992. The results revealed
significant variation within and between user groups
concerning library satisfaction, use, priorities, and
importance. These large-scale surveys had proven costly
and time-consuming to design, administer, and analyse.

Sivaraj & Esmail3 demonstrated and elaborated the
various aspects of the internet use, such as frequency of
the Internet use, methods used for accessing the internet
resources, the frequently-used places for the internet
access, purposes for the internet search and use of the
internet services, ways to browse the internet, problems
faced and satisfaction level of the students, faculty
members, and research scholars with the internet
facilities provided at the Bannari Amman Institute of
Technology.
Doraswamy made an attempt to determine the
present status of knowledge and use of digital resources.
It was observed that use of digital resources is still
inadequate among the engineering faculty of the
universities in the developing countries.

Kanniyappan5, et al. conducted a survey at Anna
University Library, Chennai to find out the use of different
types of e-resources and services and the impact of these
resources on the academic development of faculty
members. The study also highlighted the problems faced
in using the e-resources and success rate of satisfaction
in getting the required information on e-resources/
services.
Sujatha & Mudhol6 in their study demonstrated and
elaborated the various aspects of electronic information
sources (EIS) use such as frequency and purpose of EIS
use, frequently used EIS, methods of learning to use EIS,
benefits of EIS use, constrained faced in the use of EIS,
and the satisfaction level of users in the use of EIS.
Rajput7, et al. in their study made an attempt to know
the use of online access catalogue by the users. The
study revealed that the tool is useful and at the same time
respondents felt that there must be someone near the
OPAC to help in retrieving the required documents. They
also examined the utilisation and satisfaction of users
about OPAC and highlighted the suggestions made by the
users for the further improvement.
Koovakkai8 reported the user satisfaction scale
developed by him for measuring the user satisfaction of
academic libraries. The scale can be adapted and used
for measuring user satisfaction in other types of libraries
as well. Satisfying the users was prime concern of every
modern library as it was mandatory part of the libraries to
measure the satisfaction of the users in order to provide
better services.
Joteen Singh9, et al. undertook a survey on the use of
the electronic information focusing on the internet
services by the users of Manipur University Library and
examined the utilisation, purpose, difficulties and
satisfaction level of users about the internet-based
e-resources services provided by the library.

Chowdappa10, et al. depicted the extent of
dependency of users of educational and research
institutions of Mysore city on the electronic/digital media.
The responses of 1000 users and the critical evaluation of
24 subject experts under Delphi study have been
gathered to render valid findings and suggestions. The
attempt clearly showed the degree of the use of digital
information resources vis-à-vis the conventional print
media.
Patil & Parameshwar11 in their paper explained about
the e-resources and their use by the faculty members and
research scholars in the Gulbarga University, Gulbarga.
The paper revealed that the e-resources available in the
Gulbarga University Library were helpful in fulfilling their
information needs. There was need to train the faculty
members and research scholars in using the e-resources.
Natarajan12, et al. conducted a survey of 117 faculty
members and research scholars on the use and user
perception of e-resources in Annamalai University, which
revealed that despite the availability of wide range of
e-resources, the frequency of their use was low. The
reasons identified for this were lack of time, lack of
awareness, lack of subject coverage, and slow
downloading.

3. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
The scope of the study was limited to the knowledge
and usage of e-resources by the users of degree college
libraries in Chandigarh. It focused on the e-resources and
services available in these libraries.

3.1 Objectives


users of degree college libraries in Chandigarh



To find out the impediments encountered by the users
while accessing and using the e-resources



To suggest measures to take full advantage of IT to
make degree college libraries more digitally
resourceful and for providing information services

4. METHODOLOGY
As part of the study, a structured questionnaire was
designed to elicit data from the usersteachers and
studentsto know the impact of e-resources. There are 11
degree colleges in Chandigarh, which have students and
teachers strength of over 30000. For the purpose of the
study in hand, a sample selected was 770 which included
60 students and 10 teachers from each of the colleges,
respectively. The questionnaires were randomly
distributed and the filled in questionnaires were collected
from the students and teachers from each of the 11

The users were asked to indicate the problems they
encountered for accessing e-resources as shown in
Table 7. The majority of the users, 445 (57.79 %) agreed
that lack of IT knowledge and skills to make use of
e-resources followed by 389 (50.52 %) users who thought
that limited access to computers was the major problem
for not able to use the e-resources. While 252 (32.72 %)
users agreed that with using e-resources often distracts
from work being the problem, the majority of them 518
(67.27 %) disagreed with this and 321 (41.69 %) felt that
too much information was the problem they faced while
accessing the e-resources.

users to access the e-resources. 550 (71.43 %), the
majority of the users, indicated that they required training
for learning more about the internet and search engines in
order to access and make use of e-resources. Training in
information retrieval skills got the attention of 169
(21.95 %), while 162 (21.03 %) users wanted to improve
their OPAC searching. Overall, majority of the users
indicated that they should be trained for accessing

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The users of the college in particular the students, are
loaded with assignments and learning on their own in the
present day competitive academic environment.
Information seeking and gathering could be a challenging
task to these users with limited resources and services
available in a college library. The internet has attracted the
attention of the users as an easy source for accessing
information and e-resources as is evident from the study.
Yet, only a sizeable number of users could frequently
seek information from e-resources. Most of the users
access e-resources for updating their knowledge on their
respective subjects and for academic assignments.
A majority of the users found that limited access to
computers being the problem to use e-resources and
indicated their willingness to get trained to learn more
about using the internet and e-resources.
The college library should play a pivotal role in
facilitating the students and the teachers alike in the use
of the internet and e-resources and other library and
information services. The college library should organise
awareness and training programmes and seminars to
educate the users on seeking information from eresources and to maximize the use of library resources
and services. As there will be growing dependence on the
internet by the users for their information needs, the
college library should strive to have the facilities and
resources required.
