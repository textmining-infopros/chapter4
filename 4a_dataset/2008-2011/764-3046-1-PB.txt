ABSTRACT
The Web has evolved from mere HTML static pages to dynamic pages and providing information to users
in interactive and engaging ways. One of the most revolutionary tools that has changed the online experience
of Internet users is the Macromedia Flash. Nowadays, Web designers are providing both the HTML and Flash
interfaces to users. However, the users are still not sure about which interface style, i.e., hypertext-based
HTML interface or animated-based Flash interface, is better to use in terms of usability and effectiveness. This
paper compares the strengths and weaknesses of both animated and hypertext Web interfaces in terms of
their usability and also users’ attitudes and perceptions about these interfaces. To conduct the comparative
study, an animated user interface was developed using Flash for the Division of Information Studies website
of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. This interface was compared with the existing hypertext user
interface of the same website. It was found that animated user interface was preferred for its text readability,
appropriate use of colours and buttons, visual consistency and sequencing of screens, attractiveness of
design, pleasantness and user-friendliness of interface, ease of use, content coverage, organisation of
information, navigation, and usability. The hypertext user interface was preferred for its speed of downloading
and its navigational capability that complemented the Web browser navigation.
Keywords: User interfaces, HTML interface, animated interface, flash interface

1. INTRODUCTION
The Web has come a long way from mere static
HTML pages to highly interactive and engaging ones. It
is now home to many multimedia applications featuring
text, sound, images, and videos that allows interactive
data access, data input and links to other sites1. One of
the most revolutionary multimedia technologies to take
the Web design community by storm in recent years
has been Macromedia’s Flash. When it first premiered
in 1996, Flash was an unknown program and plug-in
called FutureSplash that enabled designers to add
simple animated graphics to websites. Today, renamed
and improved, Flash has evolved into a powerful Web
authoring tool and application, which is not only
redefining the art of interface design, but also
dynamically changing the online experience worldwide.
Flash-enabled websites require user browsers to have
the Flash player or plug-in installed on their computers
before the Flash movies can be viewed. This plug-in can

be freely downloaded from Macromedia’s website.
Macromedia claims that Flash player is the most widely
viewable rich client technology in the world, providing a
consistent deployment experience across desktops and
device platforms, and has a reach of over 436 million
people2.
Flash, unlike other multimedia authoring tools is a
vector-based authoring program. It works with vector
data instead of bitmaps or raster graphics like GIF and
JPEG. Vector-based contents and applications download
faster over all types of connections, and programs like
Flash provide engaging and interactive contents with a
multi-sensory experience that includes interactive
streaming video, animation, audio, and vector and
bitmap graphics3. From its earliest version FutureSplash
to the latest version, Flash has come a long way from
being a tool purely used for adding gimmicks and
excitement to a website to being one that can be used
to create an entire website without the knowledge of
49

HTML code4. Website’s whether designed in HTML or
Flash, are searched for certain information. The ease of
getting this information from a website is the one that is
going to determine whether the user will come back or
recommend the website to others. Designers often give
a lot of importance in making their websites impressive
and overwhelming using attractive animations, graphics,
sounds and videos5. But the only thing that really
matters is whether the message the site is carrying
reaches to the user, and how quickly and effectively this
message reaches the user is what that often determines
the success of a site.
However, animation used judiciously often helps to
enhance the look and feel of an interface in explaining
and communicating a concept clearer than just text
alone6. Several researchers have studied the comparison
of HTML and animated user interfaces for webpages
design in various contexts and noticed their strengths
and weaknesses7-11. On the Web we often come across
websites designed in HTML and Flash interfaces
existing concurrently. The user is given the option to surf
the HTML or the Flash interface. With its growing
prevalence on the Web and the possibility of Flash being
an alternative to HTML for website design, the question
arises which interface style, i.e., hypertext-based HTML
interface or animation-based Flash interface, is better in
terms of usability and effectiveness.
In this study an animated interface was developed
to compare against the existing hypertext interface of
the website of the Division of Information Studies,
Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The aim of
this study was to develop and evaluate concurrent HTML
and Flash interfaces of similar content and compare
them in terms of usability and effectiveness.

2. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this study are:


To examine how animation has been used in Web
user interfaces.



To examine the reasons for dual interfaces on the
Web (HTML and Flash).



To identify strengths and weaknesses of both
animated and hypertext Web user interfaces.



To compare the usability of an animated interface
against a hypertext interface in terms of interface
design, navigation, system capabilities, and
usability.



To find out users’ attitudes and perception of an
animated user interface against an equivalent
hypertext user interface.

3. REVIEW OF SELECTED FLASH/HTML
WEBSITES
For the purpose of the research, several sites using
both Flash and HTML were reviewed. In the review, sites
presenting content in both Flash and HTML were
chosen. Some sites were using Flash only for ‘intro
movies’ and for adding interactivity to certain elements in
the webpage. These sites were left out as Flash was
used as one of the many effects included in the
webpage. The selection of these sites was based on the
categories as mentioned by Calongne12, which includes,
sites selling product or services, educational/information
sites, entertainment sites, and ego-based sites. Egobased sites mainly deal about art, information or ego
including e-commerce, catalogues, and online shopping.
These categories were used as a guideline to review
how and why different websites have their sites both in
HTML and Flash versions. The websites reviewed were:

3.1 Within Reach Concepts
Within Reach Concepts (http://www.wreach.com/
flash.htm?welcome)
is a website of a company
specialised in designing Flash-based applications. The
website have both Macromedia Flash 6 and an HTML
version. Both the versions have their own look and feel.
The Flash version begans with an ‘intro movie’. The ‘skip
intro’ link takes the user to the full Flash version of the
website. Flash as well as HTML version of the website
used simultaneously. A link to the Flash plug-in
download has also been provided to get the latest Flash
player.
Besides usability problems, user may also
encounter problems with different versions. However,
user has the freedom to switch to the other design at
any point of time. Unlike the Flash site where the
contents were compactly packed within a screen, the
HTML interface has information spread over on the
screen, which requires to scroll up and down.

3.2 Go 2 Graphics
Go 2 Graphics (http://www.2ginc.com/) is another
premium website development company. The company’s
website has both Flash 6 and HTML versions. The user
has been informed that the HTML option is meant for low
bandwidth users and the Flash option is for high
bandwidth users. The user has also been provided with a
link to download the latest Flash player. The Flash
version begins with an ‘intro movie’. The ‘skip intro’ link
takes the user to the full Flash version of the website.
The look and feel of both versions are very similar, but
the navigation style used is different. In the HTML
version, the navigation links are presented at the bottom
of the screen. In the Flash version, the user has to take
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(1)

some time to figure out where the navigation links are.
The HTML version also has a useful slide out menu on
the left. This menu provides main menu links as well as
sub-menu links. The links in the HTML version loads
almost immediately, while the Flash version takes some
time to load. In either version the user is given the
choice to switch from one to another at any point of
time. In the HTML version there is a link to go to the
Flash version without the ‘intro movie’.

3.3 Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (http://www.
erau.edu/Universe/indexflash.HTML) is an aviation and
aerospace education centre. Its website is available both
in Flash and HTML versions. Though the look and feel of
both versions is similar, their navigation styles differs.
While the HTML version has conventional navigation
links on the left hand side of the screen, in the Flash
version links have been presented in the form of a spider
web. It needs sometime to understand this structure
before clicking on the links. The website’s Flash version
is available for the first two layers (i.e. navigation layers)
as subsequent layers lead to HTML pages. This was
probably due to the fact that being an academic website
the information pages were heavy in content and were
more relevant to the users as simple text pages done in
HTML.
In both versions, the choice has been given to
switch from one to the other interface. The Flash
homepage version looks very compact as all information
is presented within the screen unlike the HTML
homepage where the user needs to scroll up and down.
At this site, all information pages have been enabled as
HTML pages even in the Flash version. This helped in
the Flash version of the website searchable though the
results were displayed in a HTML pages with the search
results as links to the specific HTML page.

3.4 Algonquin Collage
Algonquin College is in Ottawa, Canada. The Flash
version of its website (http://www.algonquinc.on.ca/
highband/swf/index.htm) took sometime to download
unlike the HTML version, which came on instantly. Both
the versions were very similar in terms of navigation
style, layout, and design. In the Flash version users can
also access HTML version and vice versa in the HTML
version. While in the Flash site, the contents were
compactly packed within a screen, in the HTML version,
these can be scrolled up and down. However, in the
Flash version screen size is small and therefore divided
into many portions with directional arrows that help in
navigating easily. A lot of links in the Flash interface
opened up in new windows that displayed information on
a hypertext interface. This was also there in the HTML
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(1)

version. Sound effects were present in the Flash
interface for mouse clicks on navigational links. The
search feature is available in the HTML version and
presents the results in a HTML page.

3.5 Kreativ InfoTech
Kreativ InfoTech (http://www.kreativindia.com/) is an
e-business solutions development company. The look
and feel and layout of its websites is similar on both the
HTML and the Flash versions. The navigation structure
is similar too, thus no problems in using either of these
sites. Both the HTML version and Flash version are
presented within a screen and therefore do not require
the use of scrollbar. However, when pages are clicked,
both versions
displayed information in fixed size
windows. These windows come with their own vertical
scrollbars. The size of these windows is relatively small
compared to the area used in presenting graphics on
both versions. The font size of text used in the
information area of the fixed size window within the
Flash version is rather small for an average user to make
out. The browser ‘Back’ button in the Flash version does
not bring the user back to the previous state unlike the
HTML version. The user is given options, to switch in
both versions at any point of time.

3.6 Perceptron
Perceptron (http://www.perceptron.com) produces
information-based process improvement solutions for
industries. The look and feel, layout and the navigation
style of its websites are similar in both Flash and HTML
versions. Users of both sites would have no problems in
using either site because the designs are very similar in
both the sites. Users do not have to re-learn anything
when they switch from one version to the other. Links
are provided in both the versions to switch in between
Flash and HTML versions. This makes it easy for the
user to toggle between the two versions. As seen in
other Flash sites, the browser ‘Back’ button in the Flash
version does not bring the user back to the previous
state unlike in the HTML version. However, the
navigation elements used in the Flash version are very
clear making the movement between previous and next
states easier.

3.7 We’ve Got Your Logo
We’ve Got Your Logo (http://www.wevegotyourlogo.
com/HTML/index.HTML; http://www.wevegotyourlogo.com/
flash/evegotyourlogo.com/flash/) is an information website
provided by IP in Australia. The design is almost similar
in both the versions. Users do not have to re-learn much
when they switch from one version to the other. There
are also options given in both versions to switch to the
other version at any point of time. The Flash version
51

presents information within a screen and user do not
require to scroll up and down. However, information is
presented in small parts and users have to click on the
next arrow link to view the next screen. In the HTML
version most of the information is presented in one page.
This feature enables the user to print the page with all
the information in it. As with most Flash enabled sites,
including this site, the browser ‘Back’ button was not
able to bring the user to the previous state of navigation
unlike the HTML version, which was able to do so. In the
Flash version, user had to rely on the arrow buttons to
move in between previous and next screens.

3.8 Escaflowne
Escaflowne (http://www. escamovie.com) is a movie
website in both HTML and Flash versions. The designer
of this site has strived for similarity in the look and feel
of both versions. In both versions, user is able to switch
in between the two versions at any point of time. Though
the Flash version took some time to load, the effective
use of a status indicator tells how much percentage of
the page has been loaded. Navigation buttons in both
versions were very similar therefore user need not relearn the navigation style in the other version. Being a
movie website there was extensive use of graphics in
both the HTML and the Flash versions.

3.9 Brave
Brave (http://www. bravemusic.com/) is a music
band group. The look and feel and the navigation links of
its website are very similar in both HTML and Flash
versions. From the main site, users can access either of
the HTML or Flash versions. Both versions open up in
separate smaller windows, which are not maximisable.
In the HTML site, the user has to scroll up and down, if
information presented is not within the screen. The
Flash version presents information within the screen.
However, there are custom built scrollbars, which enable
the user to view portions of information at a time. The
font size used in Flash version is too small. On the
whole, both versions have an aesthetically pleasing look
and give the feel of being at a music site. However, once
the user is inside in one version there is no option to
switch to the other version unless the user goes back to
the main page and access the other version.

3.10 Sarolta’s Webpage
Sarolta’s (http://www3.sympatico.ca/sgyoker/) is a
personal website enabled in both HTML and Flash
versions. The Flash version took some time to load
unlike the HTML version, which downloaded quite fast.
The look and feel, layout design, and navigation style

52

used in both versions were very different, but pretty easy
to use and learn. However, in the Flash version, the links
were enabled when the mouse went over them only. This
was a bit frustrating as the user had to make sure that
his mouse is positioned over the right link all the time.
The Flash version began with a very long ‘intro’ with no
option to skip this ‘intro’ movie. The font size used in
both the versions was rather small. However, in the
HTML version, this could be overcome by changing
browser font settings.
In the 10 sites reviewed, the information content and
coverage were similar in the HTML and Flash versions.
However, the way the information was presented differed.
The HTML version was usually faster to download unlike
the Flash version, was better in terms of look and feel,
design, and the navigation elements that were often
more compelling and attractive to the users. A number of
business sites involved in e-business solutions had their
sites in both HTML and Flash to show their capability in
being able to deliver information in both interfaces.
The ‘Escaflowne’ movie website has both the HTML
and the Flash versions. But the Flash version with its
introductory animation clip and music gives the user the
experience of a movie, which the HTML version lacked.
The HTML site was done for users who want quick
information about the movie whereas Flash version was
done to give the users a feeling of the movie through the
animation and sound. Information presented with
animation interface was also interesting and appealing
as could be clearly seen in the ‘We’ve Got Your Logo’
website. The way the pages have been displayed was
very similar to how a user flips through the pages of a
book. Though the Flash version took more time to
download than the HTML version, it certainly was more
appealing than the later. By providing sites in both Flash
and HTML the content providers were able to cater and
please a wider range of audience.
After reviewing the 10 websites that have both HTML
and Flash interfaces, a checklist was prepared to rate
the sites against the following features: (i) interface
design, (ii) content coverage and organisation, (iii)
navigation, system capabilities, and usability measures.
Each parameter, as shown in Table 1 was given a rating
from 1-10 with 1 being very unsatisfied and 10 being very
satisfied. The set of 11 parameters were then added
and the average percentage values were calculated for
each category of all sites. The checklist is not a perfect
analysis of the sites as it was a subjective rating from
just one user’s point of view. However, it helped to
identify certain features that each interface lacked and
also provided useful guides in analysing the findings of
the evaluation that was conducted as part of this study.

METHODOLOGY

The methodology adopted for this study was the
Prototyping Model. A mock-up prototype of the site was
built with Macromedia Flash, which was then tested
among the users. The prototype was iteratively revised
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(1)

with the feedback given by the users. The evolutionary
prototype method was adopted in this system evolving
from a very limited initial version to its final version. For
conducting a comparative study between HTML and
Flash interfaces questionnaire-based survey method
was used.
53

This method is less formal and is useful in eliciting
details of the user’s views about the system13. The
advantage of this method is that it gets the user’s
viewpoints directly and may reveal issues, which have
not been considered by the designer. Questionnaire was
chosen as the tool as it is easy to implement as well as
administer. Questionnaires can reach a wider group of
audience and can be analysed rigorously. Also, the
questionnaire included general, open-ended, scalar and
multiple-choice type questions. However, higher priority
was given to scalar and multiple-choice type questions
as they reduce the burden on the respondent and so
encourage a high response rate. They also have the
advantage of being easier to analyse.

associated with user interfaces as mentioned by
Nielson14. They are discussed in greater detailed in
Section 5.

4.1 Questionnaire Design

A varied sample group comprising undergraduate
and postgraduate students, varied professionals such as
IT professionals, training professionals, lawyers, and
auditors were asked to evaluate the user interfaces. The
target audience was also selected based on some
degree of IT literacy. This was essential, as the
animated site required the use of Macromedia Flash
plug-in so that if a particular computer has no plug-in,
the user must have prior knowledge of downloading such
plug-ins from the Macromedia website. The survey was
conducted online via the Web. Altogether 55 people
responded to this survey.

The questionnaire designed for this study had the
following eight sections:
Personal Profile: Questions related to the background of
the user and his place within the subject population. The
questions in this section were about sex, age,
educational qualifications, occupation and computer
experience.
Interface Design: Questions concentrated on the
interface design issues that are critical in measuring the
user friendliness of interfaces. The questions covered
text readability (font size, colour, style), appropriate use
of colours and buttons, visual consistency and
sequencing of screens, attractiveness of design,
pleasantness of interface, user friendliness of site, ease
of use, ease of learning the system and whether the
information provided is easy to understand.
Under each section, questions were asked on a
scalar format where the user was asked to judge the
specific statement corresponding to a given scale. An
open-ended question was included at the end of each
section to gather general subjective information to
identify errors that may have been missed by the
designer.
Content Coverage and Organisation: It contained
questions on information coverage, organisation and use
of appropriate links to identify a category.
Navigation: The questions covered included navigational
issues, such as ease of use of navigation aids.
System Capabilities: This section covered the speed of
downloading and the connection the users were using.
Usability Measures: It comprised a set of questions
related to the five usability attributes (learnability,
efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction) that are
54

Flash Interface: The questions concentrated purely on
the animated user interface. Users were asked to outline
any problems that they encountered while using the
animated interface.
Overall: Questions covered the overall assessment of
the site including the most liked and disliked features of
each interface style as well as their comments and
feedback.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE
PROTOTYPE WEBSITE

The site being developed was an academic site.
Thus the design features that were used had to
complement the contents the site will carry. Design was
made to ensure that information could be delivered
effectively as well as attractively. The animated interface
was developed with a screen size of 750 pixels by 500
pixels. This size was chosen so that all screen
elements can be seen on 800 x 600 pixels resolution as
well as on a 1024 x 768 pixels resolution. The screen
size was also fixed such that the user will not be able to
maximise the screen. This was put in place to make
sure that the bitmaps that were included do not lose
their resolution when screen size adjustments occur at
users’ end.
The layout of the site was kept consistent
throughout in all the frames in the movie. The top banner
was used to hold the School’s name and the Division’
name with links to the respective websites. The left
navigation panel was included consistently in all the
screens and the right section was used for displaying
the contents (Fig. 1). This template was then
consistently applied to all the pages in the site to
maintain visual consistency. By its look and feel, this
site looked similar to HTML version (Fig. 2).
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(1)

5.1 User Interface
The typefaces that were used in the site were Times
New Roman and Arial. Times New Roman was used
mainly for the headings and Arial for all the textual
contents. Unlike in hypertext interface where the fonts
used may differ from browser to browser depending on
the users’ browser settings, there was no worry about
fonts displayed in Flash version. In Flash, it is possible
to create websites using any font, as they will be
displayed to the user accurately with the plug-in
installed. To provide a consistent look and feel a

common background colour was set for all the scenes
and frames in the site. This background also included
the building image of the School of Communication and
Information which is not available in HTML version.
When planning sites, it is helpful to use metaphors that
build on free associations of object or ideas4. These
metaphors can relate to sounds, images or movement.
The moving equaliser image was such a metaphor that
was included throughout the site to inform the user
about the presence of background music in the site.
This image also was added as a button to stop the
background music.

5.2 Content Organisation
The contents in the Flash site were recreated as
they were in the HTML version. All external links that
were available in the HTML version were included in the
Flash version too. The coverage of information was
limited to things pertinent to the Division which the
website was aiming to provide leaving out individual
course pages and lecturers’ home pages. Some
rearrangement of information from the hypertext interface
was done to make sure that the contents were
categorised under the appropriate headings for better
organisation and easy understanding. Also, long chunks
of information were arranged in scrollable text boxes
(Fig. 3) instead of breaking them into several pages so
as to minimise the number of mouse clicks by the user
in getting to the information.

Figure 3. Scrollable textbox.

5.3 Navigation
While browsing a site users get frustrated when
they cannot get what they wanted15. A comprehensive
navigational structure is important and helpful and
should be made available to user on every page. The
main navigation bar on the left hand side was made
available on all the pages of the site. Also, an additional
navigational history path was made available on every
page to let the user know from where he has come and
where he is (Fig. 4). This was distinctively placed at the
top for the user’s convenience.
Two approaches for structuring content on the Web
have emerged: the drill-down structure and the flat
structure15. A drill-down structure means that the
information in the site is layered in several levels
beneath the homepage of the site and users must drill
down through the layers to see it. The flat structure is a

Figure 4. Navigation path.
56

lessening of the drill down approach with one or two
levels of drill down but with minimum number of layers
so that users get faster to the information they want. The
information for this site was a flat structure as shown in
Fig. 5.
The file size of the animated site developed using
Flash needs careful consideration especially since users
will be accessing the site on the Internet. The developed
site was made to ensure that it downloads on the user’s
computer at an acceptable speed. At the clients end,
the users may be using connection of different types
such as 56 kbps, ADSL, cable modem, wireless
modem, or LAN to access the site. The animated site
was optimised in the following ways as per Web design
guidelines16.


All graphics that were used more than once were
converted into graphic symbols.



All animations that were used more than once were
converted into movie clip.



Tweened animations were used instead of frame-byframe animations due to their larger file size.



Extensive use of bitmap images was avoided while
creating animations.



Before publishing the movie, all unused items
imported into the document library in Flash were
deleted so that Flash does not publish them with
the movie.



The number of fonts used also contribute to the file
size. This was kept to four, viz., Arial, Verdana,
Times New Roman, and Monotype Corsiva.



Use of special strokes such as dotted lines or
dashed lines were minimised as they add to file
size.



Use of gradients was minimised as they result in
larger file size.



Use of Alpha transparency was minimised so that
playback of movie is not slowed down.

The ‘Bandwidth Profiler’ in Flash has a feature that
allows simulation using different types of network
speeds. It was used to test the download speed of the
animated site on different types of networks. There are
five usability attributes that are associated with user
interfaces as mentioned by Nielson14. These attributes
and were included and tested in the design of the
animated site and are:
Learnability: Measures how easy it is to learn the
interface so that the user can rapidly use and complete

the tasks. The animated site made use of familiar
navigation styles. Also, metaphors that were used in the
site, were made to ensure that they were easy to
understand and learn. For example, the moving
equaliser image was such a metaphor that was included
throughout the site to inform the user about the
presence of background music in the site.
Efficiency: Determines whether once users have learnt
to use the interface, they are able to use it productively.
The navigation style and structure of the interface was
designed in such a way that the user could go to
wherever and whenever they wanted to. A set of
navigation buttons were presented to the user on the left
hand side of the screen and maintained consistently on
all the pages of the site. Also, the navigation history
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(1)

path provided on all the pages helped the users to know
their position and use the system efficiently.
Memorability: Measures whether the interface is easy to
remember so that the casual user is able to use the site
again without having to re-learn everything. The interface
design and navigation style was kept consistent
throughout the site and this certainly made the site easy
in terms of memorability.
Errors: The site was tested on different platforms and by
different people to ensure that no errors existed in any of
the pages.
Satisfaction: Determines whether the interface is
pleasant to use, and users are subjectively satisfied
when using it. The high degree of consistency, efficient
57

and effortless navigation style and the careful design
considerations that went into the interface design were
all targeted to ensure that users will feel satisfaction
when using the site.
Other screen elements such as graphics, animation
and audio that were included in the site were:
Graphics: Graphics give visual appeal to any interface.
The images that were used in the interface were
optimised in terms of size and resolution using
Macromedia Fireworks and were imported into Flash.
Though Flash is a vector-based software, images that
were imported into it and converted to vector format
resulted in loss of quality and colour. Thus all images
that were imported into Flash and later converted lost
their original quality. However, optimising the file size of
the images helped to manage the size of the resulting
Flash movie.
Animation Effects: Animation was included in all the
pages of the site. Animation was extremely essential for
the purpose of this study to complement the information
that was being displayed. Some of the animation
elements comprised: (i) flying effect of the top banner;
(ii) navigation bar on the left loading in incrementally; (iii)
mouse over effect on navigation buttons; (iv) animated
link button to the NTU homepage; (v) animated equaliser
button that shows the presence of music; (vi) moving bar
of images on the main page; (vii) pages in the site
loading in with animation and audio effect; and
(viii) animated slideshow of images.
Audio: Sahlin16 observed that adding sound to a Flash
movie generates more compelling experience for the
viewer. In Flash sound can be added as an ongoing
background music loop or it can be tied to an event as
well. In the animated interface sound was added as
background music as well as to the following events:
(i) navigation buttons on the left hand side navigation bar
play a sound on the event of mouse over on that
particular button, and (ii) a sound effect comes on when
each page opens up on the screen.
The developed animated interface was tested well to
ensure that all the links, and audio and animation effects
were working for different resolutions as well as on
different operating systems like Windows 98, Windows
2000, and Windows XP. The interface worked
consistently on all these systems with a Flash plug-in in
the user computer. The type of Web browser used did
not affected the way the site worked. The site is
currently being hosted at http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/
sridevi/diss/IS_Introv3.swf.

6. EVALUATION OF USER INTERFACES
Evaluation of the animated and the hypertext
interfaces was carried out using a questionnaire-based
survey method. The questionnaire was sent via e-mail to
information studies students, working colleagues,
friends, and acquaintances. The target group was
identified by their computer literacy and experience with
the Internet. There were altogether 55 people who
responded to the questionnaire. Of the 55 respondents,
56 per cent were females and 44 per cent were males.
Of the total, 54.5 per cent of the respondents were in
their late twenties, 34.6 per cent were from 30-40 years
age group, 7.3 per cent were from 40-50 years age
group, and the remaining 3.6 per cent were less than 25
years of age. The majority of the respondents had a
Masters degree (53 per cent), followed by Bachelor’s (40
per cent), and one PhD. The rest (5 per cent) did not
specified their educational qualifications.
The respondents came from various fields. One-third
(31.7 per cent) were from the IT industry. This category
was technically savvy and able to evaluate the systems
objectively bearing in mind the various technical
constraints that are involved in interface design. The
second highest category of people was executives
followed by librarians, students, consultants, engineers
and people from the teaching profession. In terms of
computer literacy, 47.3 per cent respondents had 6-10
years of computer experience. More than a quarter (27.3
per cent) had 1-20 years experience, less than a quarter
(23.6 per cent) had 1-5 years experience, and rest of
these (1.8 per cent) had more than 25 years experience.

6.1 Comparison of User Interfaces
Amongst the respondents, 57 per cent found the
text size for the animated user interface to be readable
and clear. On the other hand, 46 per cent felt that the
text readability was fine in the hypertext user interface.
The text size in the hypertext user interface was
generally small and not adjustable at the browser end by
increasing the font size. The animated user interface
had a larger text size that was easy to read. Research
has shown that fonts smaller than 10 point result in
slower user performance17.
Amongst those surveyed, 60 per cent of the
respondents found the buttons used were appropriate for
the animated user interface, whereas 45 per cent of the
respondents felt that the buttons were appropriate in
hypertext user interface (Table 2). The animated user
interface had buttons, which changed colour, and
synchronised audio effect when the mouse went over on

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(1)

them to simulate the effect of clicking. The respondents
felt that the buttons in the animated user interface were
attractive and pleasant to use. The animated user
interface rated well in terms of visual consistency and
sequencing of screens (63 per cent) compared to the
hypertext user interface (50 per cent). Consistent
interfaces reduce the cognitive complexity that users
encounter in software programs and other interfaces.
A study done to analyse consistency for interface
design showed that inconsistent display layouts had a
slightly detrimental effect on the speed of performance18.
In terms of attractiveness of design, 67 per cent of
respondents found that the animated user interface was
attractive because of its animated features, lively and
appealing interface, jazzy presentation, dynamism in
displaying content during transition more impressive
than HTML interface, innovative style of presentation of
information, animation, and music. Only 28 per cent of
the respondents found that the hypertext user interface
was attractive. The majority of them (53 per cent) found
that the hypertext user interface is average, however,
some respondents felt that the hypertext user interface
was simple and clear, neatly organised and
straightforward to use.
The animated interface was rated by 58 per cent of
the respondents as pleasant to use compared to 44 per
cent for the hypertext user interface. The higher rating
for the animated user interface was attributed to the
compactness of the interface as it was presented within

one screen without the user having to scroll up and
down for more text which many found cumbersome in
the hypertext user interface. A study showed that users
spent about 13 per cent of their total time scrolling
within pages. Although each scrolling takes little time, it
was noticed that users spend a considerable amount of
time in scrolling. So, it was recommended that each
page size should not go beyond three screens19. Due to
this factor, higher percentage (44 per cent) of
respondents felt that the animated user interface was
more pleasant and user-friendly than the hypertext user
interface (39 per cent).
The animated interface was rated as easy to use by
64 per cent of the respondents compared to 59 per cent
of the respondents to the hypertext user interface.
Regarding ease of learning, about 70 per cent of the
respondents (70 per cent) rated hypertext interface very
high compared to 60 per cent who rated animated user
interface as very high. Many of the respondents were
students of DIS, and therefore familiar with the hypertext
user interface for sometime; this might be attributed to
the higher rating for the hypertext interface.

6.2 Content Coverage and Organisation
Both the animated user interface (61 per cent) and
the hypertext user interface (62 per cent) rated well in
terms of organisation of information. The flat structure
that was adopted in both the interfaces seemed to
appeal to the respondents. When creating a website, it

is beneficial to “flatten” the hierarchy and to provide
information quickly. The more steps or clicks users take
to find the desired information, the greater the likelihood
they will make a wrong choice20. Amongst the
respondents, 63 per cent felt that it was easy to
navigate from one screen to another in the animated
user interface compared to 58 per cent who found it
easy in hypertext user interface. Some respondents who
were using Netscape browser to view the hypertext user
interface found that the navigation menu did not work
properly.
Regarding ease to return to a page, both the
interfaces were rated almost the same (animated 53 per
cent vs hypertext 54 per cent). Many of the respondents
felt that the animated user interface lacked a ‘Back’
button. One respondent commented that ‘back space’
key too did not work in the animated user interface,
which works in browser environments bringing users to
the previous state. Also the navigation menu in the
animated interface was not designed to show a submenu when the mouse went over it, however, it was
available in the hypertext user interface.

6.3 Navigation
Amongst the respondents surveyed, while 49 per
cent felt that the navigational aids were helpful and
sufficient in the animated user interface, 40 per cent felt
similarly about the hypertext user interface. One of the
most common comments regarding the hypertext user
interface was that the pages were too long and users
need to scroll all the way up after viewing a page so as
to get to see the navigation bar again. The animated
user interface on the other hand packed all content
within one screen and the navigation menu was always
available for the user on the left hand side. However, the
navigation in the animated user interface lacked the
‘Back’ button feature and the pop-up sub-menu feature
that many DIS students used in the hypertext user
interface.

6.4 Speed of Downloading
About half of the respondents (48 per cent) found
that the animated site downloaded at a good speed.
However, 64 per cent felt that hypertext version
downloaded much better. The 10 sites reviewed earlier
indicated similar results whereby hypertext interfaces
downloaded faster than their animated counterparts. It is
important that websites need to load quickly. In a study,
Web users rated download time up to 5 seconds as
good, up to 6-10 seconds average and over 10 seconds
as poor. Users will generally wait about 10 seconds for a
page to download, sometimes 15 seconds, before they
lose interest21. In another study, it was found that Web
users’ tolerable waiting time for downloading webpages
in information retrieval is approximately 2 seconds22.
Almost half of the respondents (47 per cent) had
accessed the sites from local area networks (LAN) both
from NTU or their respective workplaces, and about (23
per cent) of them were using 56 Kbps connection. It was
noticed that network connection also plays an important
role in downloading webpages and also responding to
users’ interaction with the system. Table 3 shows users’
rating of the downloading speed of the animated
interface for the various connection types. A Chi-square
test was conducted to verify that there is a relationship
between the speed of downloading the animated user
interface against connection type. The relationships (P:
1.14 at 0.05 level) was found significant (Table 4).
Further, a Chi-square test was carried out to find out
whether there is a significant difference in downloading
speeds of animated interface versus the hypertext
interface. The relationship (P: 0.000215 at 0.05 level)
between the type of interface and download was
significant (Table 5).

6.5 Usability of the Interfaces
The five usability attributes (learnability, efficiency,
memorability, errors and satisfaction) that are mentioned
by Nielson were also tested in this study.

Learnability: The majority (75 per cent) of the
respondents found that the animated user interface was
easy to learn and almost equal percentage (73 per cent)
of the respondents rated hypertext user interface also
well in terms of learnability. The chi-square test also
showed a significant association between the
respondents for the animated user interface and the
hypertext user interface in terms of learnability.
Efficiency: Of the total, 82 per cent respondents, found
both user interfaces efficient to use. The chi-square test
showed a strong dependence between the animated
user interface and the hypertext user interface as well in
terms of effectiveness in use.
Memorability: In this case, 75 per cent of the
respondents found that the animated user interface was
good compared to 69 per cent who found hypertext user
interface good. The chi-square test also revealed that
the memorability of the animated user interface and the
hypertext use interface were dependent on one another.
Errors: Both the animated and the hypertext interfaces
were tested on different platforms by different people to
ensure that no errors existed in any of the pages in the
respective sites. The respondents were also asked to
list the errors encountered while using these interfaces
in the questionnaire. It was noted that most (98 per
cent) of the respondents found no errors in the animated
user interface and also in the hypertext user interface
(94 per cent).
Satisfaction: Satisfaction is an important indicator of
user attitude towards using and continued use of a
website23. The majority (84 per cent) of the users were
satisfied with the animated user interface and slightly
higher percentage of users (87 per cent) were satisfied
with the hypertext user interface. The remaining 16 per
cent who were not satisfied with the animated user
interface found that the window size of the animated
user interface was too small and wanted to incorporate
window resizing features in it. Three of those
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(1)

respondents also mentioned that the animated site was
a bit boring with too much information. A few of them
mentioned that the colour combination of blue and white
is a bit dull and boring and did not like its longer
downloading time. About 13 per cent who did not like the
hypertext user interface found that the interface is
cluttered with too much information that resulted in
scroll up and down. The presentation was mentioned as
‘a poor visual treat and laborious to read’. Overall the
design was found to be ‘monotonous’ and ‘boring’ and
that they got lost while surfing for information.
Most of the users (96 per cent) had no problems
while using the animated user interface and the effect of
animation on the users’ perceptions of an interface was
profound. Inappropriate use of animation will seems
childish and drive users away, however, sensibly
applying the same could make an interface more
graceful and enjoyable to user6. The majority (65 per
cent) of the respondents found good use of animation
that was present in the animated user interface. Many
liked the animation and commented that it was light and
downloaded reasonably fast compared to other sites
where heavy animations resulted in long downloading
times. Respondents commented that animation did
complement their actions and did not obstruct them in
any way. One respondent commented that more
animation would have made the site more interesting,
however, another respondent felt that the mouse pointer
animation was unpleasant and blocked the view when
clicking on the links. The chi-square test that was done
for the speed of downloading the animated user interface
against the animation in the animated interface derived a
value of 0.02, which showed that there was a significant
relationship between the two.
The respondents found the audio that was present
in the animated user interface satisfactory (42 per cent).
Some of the respondents found the audio, especially the
background music as distracting and irritating and felt it
was not necessary for the purpose of this site. However,
a few respondents felt that the music gave an extra
impetus and wanted those features whereby options to
select the type of music is also given. The Chi-square
test that was done for the speed of downloading the
animated user interface against the audio in the same
interface showed no significant relationship between
speed and how respondents felt about the audio.
For the images that were present in the animated
user interface, 67 per cent of the respondents found
them good. Some of the respondents commented that
the moving images on the first page were nice and that
more images throughout the pages would have
enhanced the site look even better. Contrastingly some
respondents had also commented that more images
may result in slow downloading time.
61

On the whole, 61 per cent rated favourably towards
the animated user interface in terms of interface design
as compared to 50 per cent rating for the hypertext user
interface. From the review of the 10 sites reported in the
earlier section, eight of the sites rated higher because of
their animated user interfaces. The total rating
percentage for content coverage and organisation was
better for the animated user interface than the hypertext
interface. This was similar to the 10 sites reviewed
earlier in this study where animated sites rated better for
content coverage and organisation as compared to their
hypertext counterparts. Overall, a total of 55 per cent of
respondents felt easy while navigating in the animated
user interface against 51 per cent in hypertext user
interface. For the 10 sites reviewed earlier, eight of the
hypertext sites rated high because of easy navigation.
The animated site that was developed therefore paid
special attention to navigation, especially for ease of
returning to page from where they had left, which was a
common problem in all the animated sites reviewed.
Though in the developed site the browser ‘Back’ button
was disabled completely, there was history path that
helps user to return to previous page.
On the whole for usability the animated user
interface rated well in terms of learnability, efficiency,
memorability and errors. This was in line with the 10
sites reviewed earlier as part of this study. The 10 sites
reviewed earlier also had rated well for subjective
satisfaction, which was not the case for the developed
animated user interface.

7. ONGOING STUDIES AND FUTURE
EXTENSIONS

8. CONCLUSION
The 10 sites reviewed as part of this study existed
as dual interfaces in HTML and Flash, presented the
same information, however, the style of presentation was
different in these interfaces. Most of the Flash versions
were better in terms of design and the motion elements.
However, the Flash versions were usually slower to
download unlike the HTML versions.
From the evaluation of the animated and hypertext
user interfaces, it was found that the animated user
interface was preferred for its text readability, appropriate
use of colours and buttons, visual consistency and
sequencing of screens, attractiveness of design,
pleasantness and user friendliness of interface, ease of
use, content coverage, organisation of information,
navigation and usability. Similarly, the majority of the
respondents (89 per cent) found the developed animated
user interface as good. This was in line with the ratings
of reviewed 10 sites, which rated better because of their
animated interfaces. On the other hand, the hypertext
user interface was preferred for its speed of downloading
and its navigational capability that complemented the
Web browser navigation. Though history path was
provided to replace Back button in animated interface,
some of the users are not satisfied with it and preferred
hypertext interface. In both cases, most of the
respondents did not face any problems while using
these interfaces. The main problem encountered by
some of these users is downloading time which is
dependent on connection type used. It is hoped that
technology will soon solve this problem by introducing
cheaper and fast communication lines.

This study on animated user interface against
hypertext user interface focussed on Flash against
HTML. There are various other tools that can be used for
designing animated user interfaces and this can be
explored further. The animated user interface lacked a
‘Back’ button, which is a set back, and an issue brought
up by several respondents of this study. The standard
backtracking method in the Web browser takes the user
out of the animated site itself. This was rectified in the
developed animated site through other means.

REFERENCES

Penner24 had suggested a way of combining Flash
with HTML to solve this problem of the ‘Back’ button in
Flash. Additional research can be done to find out how
this can be resolved with Flash itself without the use of
HTML. In this study both the animated interface and the
existing hypertext interface lacked a ‘Search’ feature.
Though it is possible to incorporate a search feature in
hypertext interfaces easily, Flash in general integrates
