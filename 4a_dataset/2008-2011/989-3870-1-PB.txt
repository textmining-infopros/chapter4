ABSTRACT
DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology (DJLIT) is one of the premier journals of
library and information science being published in India. It is brought out by Defence Scientific Information
and Documentation Centre (DESIDOC), a constituent establishment of Defence Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO). DJLIT has just completed 30 years of its publication. This paper presents bibliometric
analyses of DJLIT during 2001-2010. The analysis covers various parameters like growth pattern, content
coverage, authorship patterns, subject-wise distribution of articles, etc.
Keywords: Bibliometric analysis, content analysis, LIS journals, Defence Research & Development Organisation,
Defence Scientific Information & Documentation Centre

1. INTRODUCTION
Periodicals are the most preferred medium of latest
information. Scholarly journals are used by the scientists
and professionals to share their ideas, thoughts,
inventions, innovations, and discoveries. Libraries and
documentation centres worldwide ensure the free flow of
information and provide support services like circulation,
reference, photocopy, etc., to researchers in academic
institutions, autonomous research organisations, policy
making bodies, planning and research units of
government departments, business and industry, etc.
Libraries play the roles of both knowledge accumulator
and disseminator. Libraries are the only source that
generally identify, acquire and disseminate the
information. But the exponential growth of periodicals,
varied demands of readers, ever-increasing cost of the
publications, and the shrinking resources of libraries
have put constraints on libraries to subscribe the types of
resources. Bibliometric studies have helped librarians to
use their meager resources in judicious selection of
journals and other periodicals for their users.
The terms bibliometrics and scientrometrics were
introduced by Pritchard, Nalimov and Mulchenko in
1969. Bibliometric study is a simple statistic method of
bibliography counting to evaluate and quantify the growth
of a subject1. This paper presents the bibliometic study of

DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information
Technology (DJLIT), previously known as DESIDOC
Bulletin of Information Technology (DBIT), and its rise
and growth as a core and primary research journal in the
field of library and information science in India.

2. GENESIS OF THE JOURNAL
DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information
Technology (DJLIT), one of the popular bimonthly
journals of LIS in India, is brought out by Defence
Scientific Information and Documentation Centre
(DESIDOC), a premier documentation institution in
India. The Journal endeavours to bring recent
developments in library and information technology, as
applicable to library and information science, to the
notice of librarians, documentation and information
professionals, students and other interested in the field.
The articles published in the Journal are peer-reviewed,
and indexed in Library and Information Science
Abstracts (LISA); Library, Information Science and
Technology Abstracts (LISTA); Indian Citation Index
(ICI); and Indian Science Abstracts. The full text of
articles published in DJLIT is being reproduced in
electronic databases of HW Wilson Company, namely,

The periodical started in 1980 as DESIDOC
Bulletin—a four-page newsletter—basically to publish
the activities of the DESIDOC. In the late 1980s, a new
era of information technology dawned in India.
Computers started revolutionising the working culture
and information science and technology was the buzz
word. The field of library and information science was
also not left unchanged. The coverage in the DESIDOC
Bulletin also kept pace with the time and its coverage was
enhanced with new columns like IT Scan, IT Events,
Book Reviews, and Recommended Websites. It initially
included at least one paper (usually from DESIDOC) and
its print run was limited. It was unpriced and was mailed
to institutions free of charge. In 1990s, Dr S.S. Murthy,
the then Editor-in-Chief, started special issues on topics
of interest like Bibliographic Databases, Library
Networks, Electronic Publishing, etc., with eminent
professionals as Guest Editors. As the Bulletin grown in
stature and circulation, it was decided to price it to off set
the postage expenses. In 1992, the Bulletin was renamed
as DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology (DBIT).
Information technology also changed the publishing
scenario. Internet made dissemination of information
easier and writers their own publishers. DBIT too
adapted new technologies as and when these hit the
market. Under the current Editor-in-Chief, there was a
paradigm shift in the DBIT after February 2006. New
policy initiatives were taken: Editorial Board of the
Bulletin was revamped to include experienced LIS
professionals; peer-evaluation of papers, which was
earlier limited and institutional, was started involving
professionals and academicians from outside; and the
secondary information in DBIT was done away with. It
was also decided to publish at least three special issues
in a year.
In 2008, DBIT became a primary research journal
and was rechristened as DESIDOC Journal of Library
and Information Technology (DJLIT). Since then, only
primary research work, after peer-evaluation, is
accepted for publication. Thematic issues on
contemporary subjects have been brought out along with
general issues. The numbers of papers now being
published have increased to eight to nine from earlier two
to three. Two other milestones were also achieved in
2008. First, when DJLIT adopted Open Journal
System—an online publication management system. The
system helped in fast processing of papers submitted for
publication in the journal and reduced the time taken for
publishing papers from usually 11 to 12 months to 6 to 7
months. Besides, it gave the authors facility to monitor
the status of their papers online. Second, since January
2008, DJLIT became an open access journal. The fulltext of the articles being published in DJLIT is now also
available on Internet at http://publications.drdo.gov.in/ojs/
index.php/djlit.

3. OBJECTIVES
This paper has the following objectives:
±

To study year-wise distribution of papers,

±

To study authorship pattern of the papers,

±

To study average number of references per paper,

±

To study average length of the papers,

±

To study subject-wise distribution of the papers, and

±

To study institute-wise distribution of papers.

4. RELATED STUDIES
Various authors have done bibliometric/content/
citation analyses of papers published in various journals
in different fields. Thanuskodi2 has done a biblilometic
study of Journal of Social Sciences. Patra3 has done
bibliometric study of literature on bibliometric. Tigga4, et
al., and Bansal5, et al. have done content analysis and
content coverage of DESIDOC Bulletin of Information
Technology (now DJLIT). Vij and Bedi6 have done 10year bibliometric study of Defence Science Journal
(DSJ) and Verma and Tamrakar7 have analysed
contributions to DSJ.

5. METHODOLOGY
DJLIT was used as a source journal for the study.
Issues from 10 volumes, i.e., 2001-2010 were scanned
to collect the data. Quantitative and inferential methods
have been used for evaluating the data.

6. DATA ANALYSIS
The number of papers published during 2001-2010 is
271 comprising research and review papers as well as
short communications. Guest Editorials published in
special/thematic issues have been excluded from the
study. The Journal before 2006, used to publish columns
like IT Scan, IT Events, Book Reviews, Recommended
Websites, these also have been excluded from the study.

6.1 Year-wise Distribution of Papers
Table 1 shows the number of papers published in
DJLIT during 2001-2010. It is evident from the Table that
during 2001-2005 publication was not regular and on
three occasions, i.e., 2001, 2002, and 2005 five issues
each were brought out. However 2006 onwards, the
journal has been coming out regularly with all the six
issues and with more papers. Table also shows that
maximum papers (17.3 per cent each) were published in
2008 and 2009, and minimum papers (3.6 per cent) were
published in 2001.

no reference and 5 papers with more than 40 references
(one having as many as 119 references). Table also
depicts the year-wise numbers of references.

6.4 Sources of References
Table 4 shows the various sources used by the
authors for their research/study. Journals (40.31 per
cent) comprised as the primary sources of reference for
the studies undertaken by the authors. This was followed
by books (20.68 per cent), Internet/Web (20.09 per
cent), conference/symposia/proceedings (12.33 per
cent), and reports (5.57 per cent). Theses, letters, and
standards were though sourced by the authors but their
number is negligible. The Table clearly brings out the fact
that the information from Internet/Web is being
increasingly cited by the authors in recent times in tune
with the importance of e-resources being hosted under
open access archives and institutional repositories.

6.2 Authorship Pattern
Table 2 shows the authorship pattern of the papers
published in DJLIT during 2001-2010. Maximum
numbers of papers (37.6 per cent) were from single
author followed by two-authored papers (36.9 per cent).
The Table also depicts year-wise authorship pattern.
Papers by three or more authors comprised a mere 14.3
per cent and 9.2 per cent, respectively.

6.5 Length of Papers
Table 5 shows the length of papers published during
the period under study. Of the 271 papers, the largest
number (167, 61.62 per cent) had 6-10 pages; 48 (17.71
per cent) had 11-15 pages; and 44 (16.23 per cent) 1-5
pages. Only one paper each (incidentally these are
review papers) had a length of up to 25 and more than 30
pages, respectively. Table also shows the year-wise length of
papers.

6.3 Study of References/Citations
Table 3 gives details of the number of references
cited by the authors in their papers. Out of the 271
papers, 123 (45.38 per cent) have 1-10 references;
followed by 85 papers (31.36 per cent) with 11-20
references; 29 papers (10.70 per cent) with 21-30
references; and 10 papers (3.69 per cent) with 31-40
references. Also, there were 19 papers (7 per cent) with

during 2001-2006, only two (6.10 per cent) special
issues were brought out in 2002 and 2003, respectively.
There were no special issues during 2004-2006. But in
the later part of decade, i.e., 2007 onwards, the journal

Authors form government research institutions
contributed 110 (40.6 per cent) papers followed closely
by 105 papers (38.74 per cent) from universities.
Authors from colleges and private research institutions
comprised 11.07 per cent and 6.27 per cent,
respectively.

6.8 Major Contributors
Analysis was also made about the frequently
contributing authors to the journal in terms of number of
articles (Table 8). One phenomenon was observed that in
the case of a couple of institutions all the papers
submitted have some common names, especially as the
last author(s). There are instances from reputed
institutions doing world-class R&D where the name of the
Head of the institution is included as the last author. As a
result, Heads of such institutions would have hundreds of
papers to their credit. As such ‘orders’ come from the
top, all have to follow. As per the ethics of publishing, it is

not proper to include the names of those who help in
gathering data, providing facilities or helping in typing.
Their help has to be acknowledged at the end of the
paper. In view of this, the names of the first three authors
were taken into consideration for the most contributing
authors for this study. Accordingly, Dr B.M. Gupta (20) is
the top contributing author for the Journal during the
period covered by the study.

7. CONCLUSION
The Journal has completed 30 years of its
publication. During these years it has kept pace with the
improvement in its content coverage or adoption of latest
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(3)

publishing technology, or the fast emerging Web
publishing scenario. The Journal has a remarkable
change after 2006. The number of papers published
increased substantially. The average length of papers
was 6-10 pages, which is an ideal length for research
articles. Papers from single authors formed the major
chunk of total papers published. Out of 3428 references
sourced by the authors, 1382 were quoted from the
journals. Fifty-seven issues brought out during the period
included 14 special issues from eminent LIS
professionals; the Journal has published thematic issues
at an average of 3 every year since 2007. Authors from
government research institutes (104), and universities
(139) were the main contributors.
Thirty years is a long time to sustain a publication.
Subscription of DJLIT is continuously increasing,
despite its availability as an open access journal on the
Web. It has been successful in its primary objective of
information dissemination in the field of LIS. DJLIT has
emerged as a core journal of LIS and a platform for
knowledge sharing, especially among the students of LIS.
