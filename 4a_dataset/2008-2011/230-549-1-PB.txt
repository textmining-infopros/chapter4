ABSTRACT
Organisational success is directly linked to its competent workforce. Technology has brought about
immense dynamism in information and knowledge throughput. Coping with the rapidly changing information
demands is increasingly difficult, but all the same crucial. The need to identify, build, utilise, and retain talent
has never been so challenging. Global organisations are progressively focusing attention on maximising the
value of their intellectual resources and deliverables. Obvious benefits of e-learning are prompting the
organisations to adopt it into the corporate folds in many ways. This paper focuses on how the corporate
library of Tata Consultancy Services has successfully leveraged the technology platforms in two ways –
firstly, to build upon the competencies of their library team, and secondly to propagate library services effectively
to its global user community. The paper also provides an understanding on the efforts taken by the library
team of TCS to design and populate the backend content into their Learning Management System (LMS).

1. INTRODUCTION
Traditional form of learning, also commonly referred
to as the pedagogical form of learning, is increasingly
complimented with e-learning methods. It is proven that
the benefits of e-learning are undoubtedly multi-fold, both
to the educator and the learner. Technology has
crunched time and space. It has expanded human
knowledge, mingled nationalities and cultures, facilitated
social networks and is a precursor to competitiveness.
Continuous learning and professional development has
become the mantra of survival. There is a global mobility
not only of manpower resources, but also of businesses
organisations.
Globalisation has many challenges. A global
organisation has an employee-base of different
languages, cultures, variety in education systems, and
shifting time zones. Inorganic growth has splurged the
manpower strength of organisations to more than a lakh
of employees in some cases. Today, International
Business Machines (IBM) and Tata Consultancy
Services (TCS) have around 3,00,000 and 1,15,000
global associates respectively. Within the organisation,
It is found that similar roles and work profiles exist
across the spread of its geographies. There is a mix of
local and overseas recruits each carrying a different
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

educational background, language proficiencies, and
work experiences. Employers are expected to provide
‘equal opportunities’ to the workforce. But then, how
does all this link to e-learning?
E-learning has much more to offer beyond the
university-student bondage. Efforts are made here to
take a look at how organisations have used e-learning to
their benefits. Some of the offerings of e-learning are:
Technical CertificationTraining: Certain organisations
make it mandatory for their employees in a specific
role to possess professional certifications certified
by external organisations. They can perform their
work only if they continue to be recertified by that
agency each year. A yearly test validates the person
for that role.
Professional Competency Training: Organisations
train their employees on defined skills and competencies
as per their requirements such as project management,
consulting, IT system administration, and so on.
Legal Training: Employees are trained at several
locations on government regulations and laws on
such topics as sexual harassment, workplace diversity,
and so on.
49

Cultural and Language Training: Training is imparted
to the employees on the cultural differences, languages
and dialect, ethics, and etiquettes of various geographical
locations of the global company. This includes business
tips and do’s and don’ts of a particular nationality to
caution employees on the cultural errors that can
cost a business.
Product Sales update Training: Sales people are
trained in many countries around the world on the
company’s new product so that they can start selling
right away, and sell with a uniform understanding of
their product. Training specifically customised for
new salesperson on ‘How to Sell’ is also included for
new sales people who have never been in a sales job
before.
New-Hire Training: Batches of new recruits are
trained each year on what they need to know about
the organisation’s missions, vision, and values. It
ingrains them into the organisation’s working pattern
and introduces them to all other operating units, to
be speedily productive.
Continual Learning: Associates are educated on
recent developments, technologies, and trends, to
remain current in their job skills and knowledge. This
upgradation helps in instilling harmonious co-existence
between older staff and the fresh recruits. Most of
such training is imparted through online learning or
e-learning methods.
E-learning is emerging as boon to the global
organisations. It kills time zone barriers. It ensures
uniformity in the learning offered. It offers learning
objects that people can choose as per their role and
convenience. It eliminates the dependency on availability
of infrastructure and the capabilities of instructors. It
improves transparency in the process of skill
development, and offers equal learning and growth
opportunities within the organisation.

Team (CFT) is enforced to take up the responsibility of
training and competency management of the library
team. The backend efforts put in by the CFT, before the
library team could use the LMS for individual and library
benefits, are discussed in the following sections. With
these efforts on LMS, today the TCS library has been
successful in two ways—building library team
competencies, and facilitating organisational learning
through e-learning.

2.1 Building Library Team Competencies
The library uses LMS for professional competency
development of its large library team of 140. It is
physically impossible for the library management team
to monitor the growth path and achievements of a large
team. It was only natural for the TCS library to grasp
quickly the opportunities provided by the LMS to achieve
an articulated and measured professional development.
However, no operational unit within the organisation can
just start using the LMS upfront without a detailed
background work. The steps and the various efforts put
in by all the TCS libraries to build up a sound
unobtrusive learning and growth platform are given below.

2.1.1 Assessing the Library Requirements
Training should not be organised without first
knowing what skills and competencies are required to
effectively fulfill the responsibilities of each of the major
roles required to run the library. It must be borne in mind
that a LMS cannot help to reduce the painstaking work
required in defining competency framework across an
organisation. What it can do is record these in a
systematic way, so that – later in the day – they can be
used as the basis for curriculum planning and for
analysing the training and developmental needs.
Towards this, the action points of the CFT were to:


Identify the various roles that are played by the
entire library team across all its offices. Based on
the spread of TCS library establishments which
numbers to 65, eight library roles were identified and
defined.



Identify generic and functional competencies for
these eight roles. Generic competencies include the
managerial or the soft-skills required within an
individual such as communication, analytical ability,
business acumen, leadership, etc. These are of
course applicable to all the operational units within
the TCS and not something specific to the library
team. However, functional competencies are the
professional or technical abilities and are specific to
a unit. For example, a library will include information
searching skills, ability to analyse reports,
knowledge of library applications, or processing of

2. E-LEARNING INITIATIVES AT TCS
With this background on the various applications of
e-learning in the corporate world, the article is narrowed
down to the e-learning initiatives of the TCS corporate
library. TCS uses an in-house developed Learning
Management System (LMS). It is carefully designed to
meet the end-to-end training needs of TCS employees
across the globe. In other words, it groups together
competency management, training, education, and
learning by sharing. It is a single-point contact for all
employees available on the company’s portal to explore
learning opportunities and grow professionally.
The TCS library is yet new to the use of LMS
system. A special task force called the Core Function
50

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

acquired library materials, etc. Since library
requirements call for innumerable such skills, it was
decided to group the skills related to similar areas
under four broad categories, viz., information
services, tools and technologies, learning and
development, and library management.


Assign proficiency levels from 0 to 4 to every
functional competency. This ensures a steady
ascent in the abilities of the person to perform a
particular function such as elementary, exposure,
experience, or expertise. For example at level 0,
only a basic awareness on copyright is expected,
level 3 may expect the library member to hold a
certificate issued by bodies like World Intellectual
Property Organisation (WIPO), and at level 4 the
person should be able to interpret laws, anticipate
and avoid violations by team, know international
implications of infringements, etc. As one moves
from 0 to 4, the proficiencies become more complex
and cover abilities impacting the team and not just
oneself.

2.1.2 Assessing the Team
Judging competencies is not the only way of looking
at job requirements. In some cases, specific
qualifications or certifications are essential prerequisites
to be suitable for the job, e.g., MLISc degree is an entrylevel pre-requisite in some libraries. In other cases, such
as in technology or system-oriented positions,
employees may have to obtain additional diploma in
PGDLAN in order to carry out a particular task and then
be re-licensed on that certificate on a regular basis. The
LMS can do more than store this information—it can act
on it to ensure employees are informed of their
obligations and are pointed to the appropriate learning
resources.
Knowing what competencies, qualifications, and
certifications that are required for each library role, the
next task is to find out the present background,
qualifications and additional certificates of the present
team members. The LMS helps do this in a number of
ways by:


Recording the competencies, qualifications, and
certificates that a person holds.



Listing the requirements of a person’s current job or
a job that they aspire to.



Enabling the person themselves, their manager,
peers or subordinates to rate them against these
requirements.



Delivering online assessments linked to job
requirements.

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)



Recording course completions that are linked to job
requirements.



Recording a person’s aspirations for their future
career.



Recording a profile of the user’s learning
preferences in terms of method, locations,
and times.

2.1.3 Measuring the Gap
The above recorded inputs will give the CFT enough
information to measure the learning gap–the difference
between what the job requires and what the person is
currently offering or can offer.
The LMS helps the CFT to compare an individual’s
profile with that of his/her current job by:


Comparing an individual’s profile with that of a job to
which he/she aspires (typically internal to an
organisation, but could be across a sector, viz., the
IT industry).



Identifying best matching of individuals with the
particular job requirement.



Identifying the learning gap across all holders of a
particular job.

2.1.4 Creating Learning Resources
Revealing the gap is informative, but it can also be
scary, particularly if the CFT is short of the resources
needed to bridge the gaps. The situation gets especially
difficult if in case any extra LIS specific learning is
required outside the academic curriculum of BLISc and
MLISc. It is hard to find any supplementary training
programs, learning objects, and resource persons which
will fit like a glove to help the LIS professional to align
his services to meet his organisation’s specific needs.
LMS helps in designing classroom events or offline
media wherein many incorporate tools that can help to
develop online materials. It is implicit then that the CFT
is resourceful in developing online learning objects
tailored to meet the organisational needs. It becomes
imperative here that the level 4 proficiency of the CFT is
to have the capability to find and or design learning
objects either internally, or are influential and
professionally networked to arrange the same through
external sources.
It may be noted that built-in content creation tools
may be useful for creating simple content but are not
adequate for content requiring state-of-the-art multimedia
and interactivity. In these cases it would be a better idea
to look for a standalone tool that generates content
which the LMS can support.
51

2.1.5 Cataloguing and Mapping Resources

2.1.7 Building the Plan

Once identified, the various learning objects for the
library are uploaded onto the LMS with their details. It
becomes very easy for the library team to find the
resources they need to meet their learning needs, be it
an internal training given by the organisation or arranged
through external help. These include both, the
professional and managerial programmes. Any LMS is
capable of listing online courses, but it will be helpful to
list all other available resources, including classroom
events, and offline media (CD-ROMs, books, workbooks,
etc.).

It is possible for the team members to find
resources from the catalogue that meet their needs and
then go ahead and make use of them, as and when they
desire. To achieve cost-effectiveness, care is taken by
the CFT to organise any instructor-based customised
training zonal to group participants of nearby locations
into one class. The classes are also split into batches
to ensure non interruption in the library services, which
are manned by these learners. But an LMS can also
help the CFT to administer a more planned approach. It
will be worthwhile to explore if the LMS can

The LMS developed by TCS updates an individual’s
training along with competency management. The CFT
has a Herculean task ahead of tagging the managerial
and professional competencies to all the roles, along
with their desired proficiencies. It also includes the
capability to cross-reference learning resources, as and
when they are identified, to competencies. This means
they can then automatically list those resources that
address an identified gap.



Allow to assign courses directly to individuals or
groups.



Assist members in selecting the right combination
of resources to meet their needs.



Sequence selected resources sensibly; and by
recording this sequence in the form of a learning
plan.

Some systems act more as course-finders,
providing access to the many thousands of external
courses on the market, face-to-face and online. Although
these systems can be extremely useful, they are better
categorised as learning portals or even learning
procurement systems, rather than full-fledged
management systems.

2.1.8 Agreeing the Plan

2.1.6 Filtering Resources
As anyone who has used a search engine will know,
it is next to useless to be presented with a listing of
about 2000 items that match the required criteria. An
LMS can help to narrow down the search for the right
resources by acting as a filter by finding those:


Resources that match preferences for method
(classroom, self-study, etc.).



Instructor-based and real-time online events that
match learners time constraints.



Instructor-based events that take place in suitable
locations, e.g., the preferred city and branch office
therein.



Events that have available seats.



Resources that have been reviewed favourably by
previous learners.



Resources that are provided by an organisation’s
preferred suppliers.

52

Providing easy access to learning resources is
different than providing controls where the resources are
scarce (say places on classroom courses) or where
budget is involved is another. Presently, an inbuilt
workflow with role-defined rights enables the library
management team to carry online approvals/rejections
for learning requests received from their teams. An LMS
can help the CFT in limiting access to resources which
are aimed at specific target groups, e.g., some
programs like leadership, delegation, conflict, and stress
management are enabled only for the senior
management team. Presently, the workflow in LMS
allows for obtaining approvals electronically. However, it
is not linked to the payment systems to allow a range of
payment schemes, including pre-payments, credit lines,
and pay-as-you-go. Though payments are online, the
two systems are not integrated, but separate.

2.1.9 Monitoring Progress
The strength of e-learning lies in the transparency of
the system. The CFT is keen to see how their library
team grasps the lessons through e-learning. All
stakeholders—not just the CFT or library management
team, but even the administrators, team members, and
tutors can keep themselves up-to-date with events. It is
not difficult for an LMS to track who has registered for
what learning and, if that e- learning course is online,
when and for how long they are logged on. The LMS
does not provide any assessment to incomplete training.

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

2.1.10 Assessing Results
In the past, it had been too hectic to do evaluation
of training. How does the LMS help the CFT to evaluate
the training? It can measure usage– by seats registered
for. It can measure completions – how many people are
actually finishing courses. It can record reactions; and if
courses include online assessments, it can also provide
some measure of the learning that is being achieved.
Thereby, the LMS will present the roadmap of courses
that each team member on a path to a competency
would need. The LMS provides a dashboard to highlight
the competency status of every team member. The
dashboard colours indicate if the set of current
competencies for a role are met by the individual or not;
or in other words, what are the gaps that he/she needs
to fill for his/her role.
The LMS thus makes it much easier for the CFT to
keep a track of costs. And once the LMS incorporates
competency management facilities, the CFT is ready to
plot gaps in learning.

2.1.11 Offline Delivery
E-learning has not brought in a total disappearance
of traditional methods. The team at TCS heavily depends
on external programmes such as LIS conferences and
workshops to acquire learning. The present LMS cannot
substitute this form of learning, and the CFT will have to
continue managing a wide range of formats, often in
innovative new combinations. Even these offline LIS
programmes are catalogued and listed for online
approvals. It is mandatory for the team to use the LMS
workflow for appropriate approvals. These learnings will
also be tagged to the competencies and proficiencies.
This way the CFT gets a report of learnings for the team
in its entirety, viz., external, internal, managerial, or
professional.

2.2 Facilitating Organisational Learning
Companies use digital tools mainly as a way of
making business travel more selective and more
productive. Yet, the potential for digital displacement of
business travel is substantial. A survey in June 2008
sponsored by the online travel company Orbitz and
Business Traveler Magazine1 found that 42 per cent of
businesses were exploring alternatives to travel, like
videoconferencing and Web-based meetings.
Often, business situations require making sure that
every member in a group learns something, and that
each one learns it by a deadline. The success of
organisation lies largely on the informed decisionmaking of its leadership. An online learning environment,
which is outside the LMS, is provided through tools such
as videoconferencing, discussion forums, chat rooms,
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

learning materials like CD-ROMs, and e-books. When
the training is clearly linked with retaining the job, the
training programme has a good chance of overall
success. Alan, in his article on Corporate e-learning
programmes, mentions that “if e-learning does continue
to grow and become a predominant source of
organisational learning, its effective use will have a major
impact on international economics”2.
Library is an enabler of its organisation’s learning.
Just as it is important for the library to enable its team
to move up the competency ladder, a bigger
responsibility of the library is to enhance the overall
competency of the entire organisation by providing
relevant information services. Realising this, the TCS
library has strived to be in the forefront to use online
platforms to leverage its services across its global
users. In this particular scenario, the CFT for training
takes a back seat, and the focus shifts onto CFT for
information and research services, and the CFT for
marketing. These CFTs use the technology platforms to
train library team members and its users on various
information products, tools, and resources. Additionally
they also use the platform to market its services to the
users. The two platforms, videoconferencing and
WebEx, are chosen here to illustrate the power of
interactive learning.

2.2.1 Videoconferencing
Videoconferencing (also known as videoteleconference and tele presence) is defined as a set of
interactive telecommunication technologies which allow
two or more locations to interact via audio and video
transmissions simultaneously3.
All the participants can therefore learn via a 2-way
communication platform. TV channels were used to
deploy this technology to receive news reports and clips
from distant locations, until satellite transmission came
into practice.
Videoconferencing is an effective way of connecting
with people from distant locations in a typical
conference environment. Being audio-visual in nature,
participants at both ends can see and interact with each
other.
This technology is being extensively used by TCS
libraries since 2005 to conduct meetings with senior
management for inputs in terms of performance,
expectations, future strategies, etc. At times it has also
been used to conduct training sessions on quality,
marketing of services, etc., without the faculty having to
physically travel to the venue. It has also been
successfully deployed to conduct library’s induction
session from remote locations for fresh recruits.
53

2.2.2 WebEx
WebEx Communications Inc. is a Cisco Systems,
Inc. company and its WebEx Application Suite consists
of a set of online collaboration tools. Its Meeting Centre
tool is regularly used by TCS Libraries. This tool
supports pre-scheduled/on-the-spot, anytime, anywhere
meetings with people based at any location across the
globe. It provides spontaneity and interactivity on par
with face-to-face meetings and facilitates sharing of
presentations, applications, documents, and desktops
with integrated audio-video features in a rich-multimedia
environment.
WebEx Meeting Centre was successfully deployed
for the first time to impart online training, when TCS
Libraries’ Virtual Reference Desk was launched in
September 2007. The launch of this service envisaged a
sudden flow of user queries (an inundated logging of
online tickets for queries coming 24x7 from a range of
users-new recruits, onsite associates, technology
heads, location heads, and even support teams) across
all geographical locations across all domains and
across all operating units of TCS. It was crucial for all
the library pool members of the virtual reference desk to
be adapted to this onslaught in the shortest possible
time and group of 35 library professionals based at 12
cities across India underwent a two-hour training
session from their respective base locations. The
participants were connected with a teleconference
bridge for audio/interactions and simultaneously were
taken on a virtual tour of the system. The desktop of the
faculty was shared with all participants, enabling them
to view the entire navigation screen-by-screen. They
could get the feel of the system, get on the spot
clarifications, discuss among themselves and resolve
doubts–a complete meeting experience, totally online.
After the two hour WebEx meet, all the 35 participants
were fully equipped to go live with the Virtual Reference
Desk in a real-time environment. Other than saving time,
the meet helped save on costs of travel,
accommodation, and other overheads.
Encouraged by the quick, cost-effective, and
successful deployment of WebEx for Virtual Reference
Desk, another similar session was arranged for
educating the users across the globe on Libraries’ new
products and services. Search our Sources (SoS) is a
customised search engine, which is recently designed
by the TCS’s Corporate Library, using Google Custom
Search Engine (CSE) to facilitate federated searches.
TCS subscribed databases were used for this purpose.
Around the same time, the Library also provided
enterprise-wide access to EBSCO database for its
associates. A WebEx meet was arranged for a demo of
both SoS as well as EBSCO for associates based at
overseas locations. A 30 minute audio-visual session
with a teleconference bridge proved most beneficial for
54

the participants with interactive demos enabling
marketing of services and offerings, on-the-spot
troubleshooting and query resolution, ensuring a smooth
launch and optimum use of resources available.
The chat transcripts, interactive whiteboard, and
documents which were shared during a WebEx meeting
could be saved by all participants to fall back on in
future, if need arises. Associates who participated in the
WebEx meeting have had a positive word to say about
the utility and ease of use, which further endorsed the
effectiveness of the tool. These successful deployments
have paved the way for propagating Library offerings
using WebEx Meeting Centre.TCS library’s involvement
in e-learning is thus aimed at benefiting both the library
team to build team competencies, and the library users
by leveraging the library services through the e-learning
platform.

3. OBSERVATIONS
Having an LMS in place does not effectively aid elearning in an organisational set-up, nor would it change
the mindset of people. In-person meetings are still
preferred over virtual meets, and faculty-driven learning is
very much in vogue at many places. The need to make
people aware of e-learning technology and tools, and to
drive them towards e-platforms is one of the challenging
aspects for the successful deployment of any e-learning
system.
The uphill task at TCS however, was not much
about the mind-set as it was about preparing the LMS
with ground-data by drafting and tagging of the roles,
competencies and proficiencies. LMSs can produce
meaningful results only when the content is thoughtfully
mapped and organised. The tricky differences between
role, activity and goals became clearer as the system
mandates got defined bit by bit.
To have a sound e-learning system in place, onetime investment in terms of cost and intellectual
resources could be a little steep and unavoidable. But
experience has proved that the results far outweigh the
cost in the long run. If utilised effectively, the system
can provide the backbone not only for competency and
career building, but also for job-person profile matching,
performance management, succession planning, etc.

4.

FUTURE PLANS

TCS is an organisation which lays much importance
on the continual learning of its associates. So the
management has realised the need to cascade this
importance down to its library team. The balanced
scorecard of the library mandates a learning of 60 hr per
year per library staff; the year 2007-08 touched the
average of 62.4 man-hours. This was only possible
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

because of the strong management belief and support in
the continual learning process. In the current year
however, the library team plans to achieve the same
learning target but with reduced costs in training and
travel. In the year 2007, 14 per cent of the team learning
was acquired through e-learning platform. This is a rising
trend and displays a positive mindset and the readiness
to indulge in virtual learning.
Apart from individual learning and development,
CFT’s future plan includes the use of online sessions to
enrich the entire team. These sessions will reach library
teams placed across locations. Training will include
educating the team on professional skills like database
searches, and other techniques like making company
profile, analysis, and improving the organisational
content. Virtual training is also planned to provide faceto-face interactions with various unit heads of the
organisation, who are otherwise inaccessible. This
approach is planned to attain proximity with end-users
and know their needs through online meetings.
Every year, an induction session is arranged for the
new library recruits to convey and uniformly inculcate
the TCS values, culture, and processes. A computerbased or web-based training is being planned in the
current year, wherein the entire induction session can be
recorded and put up on a server or on LMS. The fresh
recruits can register and attend as per their
convenience. This would immensely cut down the loss of
man-hours which go into the planning, designing, and
conducting sessions every year, not to mention the cost
saved on travel, accommodation, infrastructure, and
other overheads.
Further, TCS has a collection of e-books for internal
use, which is made available to all associates on the
intranet. Library is planning to facilitate an integrated
one-point search for the physical as well as electronic
collection, so that anyone searching library catalogue
would get 24x7 access to resources. This would help
promote optimum use of resources, and a culture of elearning among associates.Based on the core results of

such initiatives, similar LIS specific functional
competency-based training courses will be devised and
launched via WebEx meetings for the rest of the team,
to maintain a high profile skilled team.

5. CONCLUSION
“Good teaching is good teaching, no matter how it
is done”. The old proverb still rings true, especially in the
corporate sector, where e-learning is increasingly being
resorted to in view of its multifold benefits. A task force
with rich professional experience and a broad
professional outlook will surely make the learning and
competency framework of the library more meaningful
and exhaustive. Online platforms are more transparent
and visible, and thereby help libraries to reach out and
project their services far and fast. Technology has
matured to the stage where it is often practical,
affordable, and more productive to move bits instead of
bodies. Exposing team members to working and
learning models beyond the traditional set-up is gainful
for the organisation as the teams are able to benefit from
and participate in the pool of global expertise. Online
learning and sharing is going to be an accepted way.
More than 50 per cent of India’s population is under 25
years of age. Assuming that there will be a tech-savvy
brigade of library users, multi-channel synchronous
modes of communication, delivery and learning is the
change implied for the GenX libraries and their users.
