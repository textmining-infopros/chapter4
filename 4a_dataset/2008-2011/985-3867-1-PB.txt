ABSTRACT
This paper aims to find out the level of awareness and use of library portals by the students of
Engineering and Technology of Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh. Data was collected through a structured
questionnaire distributed to the undergraduate and postgraduate students of Engineering and Technology at
AMU. The survey found that the majority of the students use library portals but not regularly. The study also
found that the reasons for not using the library portal were lack of awareness, training and guidance, and the
lack of contents on the library portal. The majority of the respondents gave average value to their library with
regard to portal provision of course material and useful links. A majority of the respondents also expressed that
they needed instructions and help for the effective utilisation of resources on the library portal.
Keywords: Portals, user studies, engineering and technology library, library portal, Aligarh Muslim University

1. INTRODUCTION
A portal is a location on the world wide web (WWW)
usually containing a collection of hyperlinked documents
and files. A library portal has a unique uniform resource
locator (URL), which normally, but not necessarily, points
to the entry page or home page for the library site.
Academic libraries cater the need of information of their
users. In the last decade library websites have become
the first point of contact. It has become increasingly
important for libraries to evaluate the usage of portal to
verify that the information being provided to their users is
pertinent, clearly presented, and internally consistent. It
is important to see that the resources and services
provided by library Portal are well utilised by the
academic communities. This study was done to
determine the usage of the library portal by the students
has a great significance of engineering and technology
at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and the library to
improve the contents available on its portals.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Augustine and Greene1 studied the way users
searched information. Astroff2 home page design of

patterns indicating genre development; a number of
university home pages with no direct links to the library
webpages disrupted user expectation.
A study conducted by Breckbill and Baldwin3
revealed that some academic libraries displayed a main
library webpage as the default home page of their
websites. Booth4 in his study aimed at the practical
issues involved in providing a website that meets the
needs of diverse users. Comeaux5 indicated that despite
an increase in accessibility, only 50 to 60 per cent of the
websites were free of Bobby-detectable errors. This is
the only study that provides trend information about the
accessibility of a broader set of library and library school
websites.Usability of the academic library portal was
assessed by Elaine and Louise 6.
The purpose of their study was to access usability of
an academic library website and to understand how
faculty and students complete typical task using library
portal. The authors found that library websites failed to
take into account how people approach the information
problem. Li7 examined the geographic distribution of users
and usage patterns of the library Web page, the peak usage
times, and the computer environment which included type of
Web browsers, operating systems, screen resolutions,
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(3)

and screen colours, etc. In addition, the study also
compared usage statistics gathered before and after the
library’s Web page promotion activities, to measure the
effectiveness of these business management and library
marketing efforts.

Peters8 highlighted the practical aspects of usage
statistics. Efforts to standardise the gathering and
interpretation of e-resource usage statistics in the USA
show promise for accelerating the adoption and diffusion
of reliable, meaningful usage information. The article
found, with some speculation, the overall value and longterm potential for e-resource usage statistics. Pearson,
Green and Pearson9 investigated the relative importance
of five key criteria for assessing Web usability.

±

To ascertain users’ opinion regarding usefulness
and adequacy of contents/resources on library
portal

±

To know the barriers faced by the students in using
library portal.

These criteria are navigation, download speed,
personalisation, ease of use, and accessibility. This
study utilised a scenario-based, multi-criterion decisionmaking approach. The research indicated that, as
expected, ease of use was the criteria that the
respondents considered most important in assessing
Web usability. The findings from this study have practical
implications for website designers and the results
indicated that less effort/resources should be devoted to
personalisation and customisation, and more in making
sure that websites are easy.
Shemberg found that it is often difficult to locate the
library portal from the university name. Information that is
essential on every library website includes postal
address with zip codes and Web master e-mail contact
when this information is not readily available. It was found
that academic library sites were often difficult to
navigate. Tranis and Elaina11 examined how students use
electronic research libraries. Major finding of this study
showed that design features website can drastically
affect the success of the students doing research.

Xue12 attempted to evaluate a government
publications library website by studying its usage
statistics. It examined organisation, including access,
search ability, and structure, of electronic government
information in subject directory format. This study
revealed that a subject directory website is an important
tool for distributing electronic government information,
but it requires continuous development. The usage
statistics are useful in monitoring search engine ranking,
improving display, structure, and search ability.

3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

±

4. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
The study is intended to give an overview of the use
of library websites by the students of engineering and
technology, AMU at their own institution’s library portal or
other institution’s library portals. The study has certain
limitations, users and non users of library websites; the
geographical area restricted to Zakir Husain College of
Engineering and Technology, A.M.U, Aligarh, and the
responses from Postgraduate (PG) and undergraduate
(UG) students of academic year 2009-2010.

5. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The data related to the study was collected using a
structured questionnaire. The gap was filled up by the
researchers through
informal interview with the
respondents and observation in the library.

6. SIZE AND SAMPLE OF THE POPULATION
Ninety questionnaires were personally distributed
among the randomly selected UG and PG students of the
faculty of engineering and technology at the university
campus. A total of 53 filled in questionnaire were
received, out of which, only 50 questionnaires were
taken for the study, 3 questionnaires were rejected due to
incomplete responses. The overall response rate was
55.55 per cent.

7. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS
The data collected through questionnaire,
observations and informal interviews was througly
organised and tabulated using simple statistical methods,
tables and percentage. The table and graphs were
generated using MS-Excel-2007. The findings of the
study are presented below:

The study has the following major objectives.

7.1 Distribution of the Respondents

To find out the level of awareness and use of library
portal by the students

In the overall respondents, 34 (68 per cent) were UG
and 16 (32 per cent) were PG students (Figure 1).

that only a few UG as well as PG students used library
portal daily.

7.6 Frequency of Use of Other Institutions’
Library Portal
The respondents were asked how often they make
use of other institutions’ library portals. Table 4 indicates
that 32.36 UG students used other institutions’ library
portal sometimes and rarely, while as 17.65 per cent
used very often, and only 11.76 per cent often used
these portals. It was found that only 25 per cent PG
students used other institutions’ library portals very often
also 37.50 per cent and 31.25 per cent who rarely used
other institutions’ library portals.

7.7 Use of Information Sources and Services
Provided through Maulana Azad Library
Portal
Table 5 shows the frequency of use of Maulana Azad
library portal by the students. It was observed that UG
students very often made use of web OPAC 35.29 per
cent, 58.82 per cent of E-Journals, 58.82 per cent of
Encyclopedia and useful links 35.29 per cent, and 41.17
per cent of UG students used curriculum resource and
encyclopedias occasionally. Also, 58.82 per cent of UG
students expressed that they never used electronic
books. Table 5 also shows that the average number of UG
students used most of the services occasionally followed
by rarely. On the other hand PG students very often used
electronic journals (81.25 per cent), useful links (62.50
per cent), electronic directory (43.75 per cent) and
electronic books (43.75 per cent) followed by web OPAC
(37.5 per cent). The PG students rarely made use of the
curriculum resource (68.75 per cent), other digital
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(3)

collections (81.25 per cent), ask a librarian (81.25 per
cent) and electronic books (50 per cent).The study
reveals that majority of the UG and PG students
‘occasionally’ used the resources and services provided
through Maulana Azad library portal. The investigators
felt that the UG as well as PG students may not be aware
about the different types of resources and services
provided on the portal and also the material may not be
useful to them or the provision of information is not
adequate on library portal. It is also felt by the
investigators that the UG students need training and
assistance to enhance the use of the library Portal.

7.8 Mode of Access to Library Portals
Table 6 shows that majority of the UG students i.e.
29.41 per cent followed a link to the library portal from
another page on the Web and searched it by name
through a search engine, and 14.71 per cent
bookmarked it on their Web browsers as a favorite site.
Only 14.71 per cent used their personal home pages to
link the site directly. The PG students (18.75 per cent) on
the other hand searched for it by name through a Web
search engine. The same percentage of PG students
used their personal home page, which linked the site
directly. A high percentage (37.5 per cent) of PG
students indicated that they follow a link to the site from
another page on the Web.

7.9 Relevancy of Resources Available on
Library Portal
Table 7 shows that 38.23 per cent of UG and 31.25
per cent of PG students strongly agreed with the
resources available on the library portal whereas 20.58
per cent UG and 25 per cent PG agreed with the
relevancy of resources available. Further, 11.76 per cent
UG and 12.5 per cent PG students disagreed regarding
the relevancy of resources available on the library portal.

7.10 Value of Library Portal
Table 8 depicts that while 17.64 per cent of UG
students give it a very high and high value majority of UG
students (38.23 per cent) gave it an average value to
library portal, and other data follows. Where as on the
other hand 18.75 per cent PG students gave it a very
high and high value. Majority of the PG students (31.25
per cent) gave it an average value.

7.11 Need for Training and Guidance
It is discernible from the Table 9 that 44.11 per cent
of UG and 37.5 per cent of PG students strongly agreed
with the opinion that the training and guidance can
improve the efficiency of use of library portal. While 24
per cent UG and 18.75 per cent of PG students agreed

7.12 Overall Satisfaction with Library Portal
To know the overall satisfaction regarding the
quality, contents and arrangement of links of the
Maulana Azad library portal, students were asked the
questions like image quality, layout, arrangement of
hyperlinks and ease of use, etc. Table 10 shows that
64.70 per cent of UG students were highly satisfied with
ease of use of library portal followed by arrangement of
hyperlinks, Web OPAC, and access to full contents.
A high percentage of the UG respondents were
moderately satisfied with the image quality, layout,
arrangement of hyperlinks, online catalogue (OPAC),
ease of use, access to back issues, and access to full
content etc. On the other hand it was found that a very
less percentage of respondents were dissatisfied and
highly dissatisfied.
The Table also indicates that only 56.25 per cent PG
students were highly satisfied with the ease of use of
library portal followed by arrangement of hyperlinks and
Web OPAC. Where as a high percentage (81.25 per
cent) of PG students were satisfied with access to full
content of resources followed by arrangement of
hyperlinks (56.25 per cent), ease of use (20.58 per
cent), OPAC (25 per cent) and image quality (18.75 per
cent) majority were neutral the questions regarding the
image quality, layout, arrangement of hyperlinks and
ease of use, and access to back issues. A few
percentage of respondents were dissatisfied with image
quality (25 per cent), and access to back issues of
journals (31.56 per cent). Very few PG students were
highly dissatisfied with access to back issues of journals
and layout of the portal.

9. CONCLUSION
Library portal has became one of the most
commonly used media for effective and efficient delivery
of information as it not only offers information about
policies, staff, opening hours, library members and
services available in the library, but also conveniently
deliver electronic resources such as electronic books,
electronic journals, online databases, online dictionary,
encyclopedia,
bibliography,
electronic
directory,
biography directly to the users on their computer
screens. The study found that majority of the students
use library portals but not on a regular basis. A high
percentage of users used their own library portal followed
by other institutions library portal as well. The
investigators found that the reason for not using the
library portal was lack of awareness and lack of training
and guidance. Therefore, it is the need of hour that more
and more information literacy programmes should be
conducted by the libraries to enable the effective use of
library portal. However, this study mainly focuses on the
the undergraduate and postgraducate students the
similar studies on faculty members and research
scholars at various departments of the university, and a
comparative study may also be conducted between other
central universities.
