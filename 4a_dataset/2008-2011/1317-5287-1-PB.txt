ABSTRACT
Internet has become the backbone of the modern education system. The academic community uses
internet to satisfy its diverse needs; be it information, education, communication, or research. The students,
who were born during full bloom of internet revolution, extensively use internet to satisfy their various needs.
Therefore, the present study was conducted to compare the use of internet by the rural and urban college
students and identify the problems faced while searching the internet. The stratified random sampling technique
was employed to select students and data collected through a questionnaire. The results reveal that majority
of the students are frequent users of the internet using internet from daily to weekly basis in which use by
urban students is more than their rural counterparts. The findings further reveal that rural students mainly
use internet at home whereas urban students highly use internet at commercial cyber cafes. Majority of the
urban students use internet primarily for a specific information whereas rural students mostly use internet
for education. Majority of students, irrespective of regional differences, dont use internet sources like emagazines, e-journals, e-books, wikis and blogs up to their expected usage. The findings also indicate that
both the rural and urban students face the same problems with slight variations like information overload (too
many hits) followed by internet illiteracy (lack of internet operating/searching skills), financial barrier (paid
information), and information pollution (too many irrelevant hits).
Keywords: Internet, usage pattern, web use, internet surfing, urban college students, rural college students

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Internet Services in Kashmir Valley

Internet, the ever expanding technology, serves as
one-stop point for all the needs of academic community,
be it information, education, communication, or research.
It provides access to galaxies of internet services round
the clock (24X7) and sources at a click. These galaxies of
internet services and sources have attracted a large
number of people from all over the world towards the
internet. According to Internet World Statistics1, the
population of internet users worldwide is 1,733,993,741,
almost covering 25.6 per cent of the total world
population. The highest percentage of internet users
belongs to younger generation who opened their eyes in
full light of internet age. The college students are the main
dominators of these services and sources as they are well
versed with the new technologies and their applications in
the present networked society. Williamson2 reports that
out of 18.0 million college students, 17.1 million (95.0 %) go
online at least once a month in 2007 and out of 18.2 million,
17.4 million (95.7 %) use internet once a month in 2008 in
USA.

Internet services were introduced in the Kashmir
Valley during 1994-95. At that time, there were four ISPs
in the Kashmir valley: National Telecom Company BSNL
owned by Government of India and privately owned ISPs
IPEAKS; SLICNET; and INFONET3. Presently, six ISPs
are operational in the valley, BSNL, Airtel, Aircel, Tata
Indicom, Reliance, and Vodafone. There are more than
100 cyber cafés in Srinagar alone. Some of the leading
cyber cafés operating in summer capital of the Valley is
ethernet, hotline, CNET, Net Surfer, and BBC online. The
government also established 57 community information
centres in the Kashmir valley to provide internet services
to the public4.

1.2 Internet Facility in Colleges
The internet service isnt available to the whole
academic community in Kashmir valley. Most of the
higher institutions like University of Kashmir, Srinagar and
National Institute of Technology (NIT), Srinagar have
431

started to provide these facilities to the academic
community from last few years. The University of Kashmir
has played a leading role in initiating the process. It
established the internet access centres in the library
premises separately for students, scholars, and teachers
in 2002 and on December 4, 2008 opened two more
browsing centres and named these as E-resource
Centre and 24X7. Now almost more than 200 computers
are available in the library for browsing the online
information. Besides the services in central library of the
University, internet access centres are available in almost
all departments besides the Wi-Fi system available in the
whole campus. Besides, some other higher academic
institutions like Sher-i-Kashmir University of Agricultural
Sciences and Technology-Kashmir (SKUAST-K), Sher-iKashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), and NIT,
Srinagar, provide internet services to the academic
community since the last decade. Initiated by these
universities, most of the degree colleges have also
established browsing centres for their academic
communities to enhance their academic performance.
The students also exploit these services for various
purposes. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to
compare the internet use by rural and urban college
students.

cent for surfing websites, 52.4 per cent for reading
newspapers, and 45.5 per cent for enjoyment, fun, and
playing games. Ureigho14, et al., identified that 21.70 per
cent of the respondents used internet for chatting, 20.92
per cent for e-mail service, 19.87 per cent for research
materials, 18.75 per cent for online dating, 15.53 per cent
for entertainment, and 3.22 per cent for religious
information.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW

The survey method of research was used to conduct
the study and questionnaire was used as a data
collection tool. After the survey, a questionnaire was
drafted, it was pre-tested with 30 students. The
questionnaire was then modified (simplified) base on the
result of the pre-test. Later, the data was collected from
302 college students (Net generation) during academic
sessions. The stratified random sampling technique was
employed for on the spot selection of students. The data
was collected with respect to three demographics, i.e.,
gender, region, and faculty. The questionnaire was
administered personally to ensure the excellent response
rate as well as to avoid any misunderstanding while
providing responses. The data were analysed using
different quantitative techniques and presented in the
appropriate formats.

The available literature on the internet usage reveals
that the internet is widely used by the students
community all over the world for different purposes.
Jones5, et al. revealed that 79 per cent of college students
agree that internet use has a positive impact on their
college academic experience. Mishra6, et al. indicated
that a majority of the students (85.7 %) use internet in
which the male students are more than female students.
Blaiso7 revealed that urban respondents use internet more
than their rural counterparts. Laite8 reported that 57.6 per
cent of the undergraduate students used internet 1-2
times in a week, another 37.1 per cent used it 1-2 times in
a day, whereas 54.7 per cent of the graduate students
used internet 1-2 times in a week and 37.7 per cent used
it 1-2 times in a day. Kumar and Kaur9 disclosed that
majority of the respondents (69.4 %) used the internet for
educational purpose, (51.9 %) for research purpose, (47.4
%) for communication purpose, and (34.7 %) for
entertainment purpose. Pivec10 identified that 45 per cent
of the students used internet for entertainment, 33 per
cent for news and information, and 22 per cent for
education, respectively. Bao11 reported that students
search internet for information related to both their
academic (83.2 %) and non-academic purposes (73.8 %).
Zhang12 depicted that 94.2 per cent of the scholars used email, 92.3 per cent web, 90.4 per cent mailing lists, 83.3
per cent Telnet, and 80.1 per cent FTP, respectively.
Study by Tadasad , et al. revealed that 87.4 per cent
of the respondents used the internet for e-mail, 54.5 per

The available literature reveals that a good number of
studies have been conducted about the internet use by
academic community. However, the gaps are obviously
there; as the use of internet sources and problems faced
in searching the internet by the new generation students
havent been taken care of. Moreover, the present study is
conducted to compare the internet use by rural and urban
students, which is a step forward in the research.

3. OBJECTIVES
The present study was conducted to compare the use
of internet by the rural and urban college students and to
identify the problems faced by them while searching the
internet.

4. METHODOLOGY

5. SCOPE
The scope of the present study was limited to the
academic college students of Kashmir valley covering the
faculties of general science, social sciences, humanities,
business and commerce and computer science. The total
number of such colleges in Kashmir valley is 20 in which
11 are falling in rural areas and 9 in urban areas.

6. LIMITATIONS
The study was involving the college students, and
therefore, it was not projectable to the entire population.
Further, the information collected was based on a small
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)

group (n=302) of college students who used internet, and
hence, the results cannot be applied to entire new
generation students.

7. DATA ANALYSIS
7.1 Frequency of Internet Use

Table 2. Place of using the internet by rural and urban students

The results depict that 80.47 per cent of college
students use internet ranging from daily to weekly in
which 25.17 per cent used it daily, 31.46 per cent 2/3
times/week, and 23.84 per cent once a week. The areawise break up of data showed that urban students were
frequent users of internet than rural students as 73.95 per
cent of rural students used internet ranged from daily to
weekly compared to 84.70 per cent of urban students
(Table 1).

purposes (especially downloading online games and
images). The results further revealed that urban
students used internet more for information (39.89 %)
than rural students (31.09 %), whereas more rural
students used internet for education (35.29 %) than
urban students (23.50 %) (Table 3).

7.2 Places of Using Internet
The data discloses that majority of the students
(33.44 %) used internet at commercial cyber cafes
followed by home (26.16 %) and college (19.21 %). The
regional data showed that rural students mostly used
internet at home (29.41 %), followed by college (21.85 %)
and commercial cyber cafes (18.49 %) whereas urban
students mostly use internet at commercial cyber cafes
(43.17 %), home (24.04 %), and college (17.49 %). It is
also clear from the data that rural students used
community information centres (14.29 %) more than
urban students (2.73 %) as most of these centres are
located in rural areas (Table 2).

7.3 Purposes of Internet Use
It is clear from the study that students used internet
primarily for information (36.42 %) followed by
education (28.15 %), communication (16.89 %) and
audios and videos (12.91 %) respectively. A small
number of students (5.63 %) used internet for other

7.4 Use of Internet/Web Sources
The data shows that 63.91 per cent students used
e-newspapers, 39.07 per cent used e-magazines, 23.84
per cent used e-books, and 13.91 per cent used ejournals. Besides these sources, 47.02 per cent used
other sources like general websites, news channels,
sports channels, dictionaries, encyclopaedias, and many
others.
The region-wise break up of data shows that urban
students used e-newspapers (65.03 % versus 62.18 %)
and e-books (25.68 % versus 21.01 %) more than rural
students whereas rural students used e-magazines
(42.86 % versus 36.61 %) and e-journals (15.13 % versus
13.11 %) more than urban students (Table 4).

7.5 Reasons to Use Web Sources

7.6 Use of Search Engines

The students highlight and related many useful features
of web sources like accessibility, interactiveness, up-todate, timeliness, wide coverage, and multimedia. Up-to-date
information (40.73 %) was rated as the best feature followed
by timeliness (24.17 %).

The most widely used search engine is Google
(56.95 %) followed by Yahoo (22.19 %). The area-wise
figures show that rural students use Google (61.34 %
versus 54.10 %) more than urban students whereas urban
students use Yahoo (21.85 % versus 22.40 %) slightly
more than rural students (Table 5).

7.7 Problems Faced While Searching
The students faced various problems while searching
the internet. The widely faced problem was information
overloadtoo many hits (39.74 %), followed by internet
illiteracylack of internet operating/searching skills
(23.84 %), financial barrierpaid information (15.89 %),
and information pollutiontoo many irrelevant hits
(13.91 %).

*Figures in parenthesis indicate percentage

The region-wise information shows that rural students
use online sources more than their urban counterparts
due to remote access and up-to-date features, whereas
urban students used online sources more than their rural
counterparts due to interactive and timeliness features
(Fig. 1).

The other problems faced were lack of downloading
facility, restricted access, language barrier, etc. It is also
visible that urban students felt information overload (44.81
% versus 31.93 %) more than rural students whereas rural
students faced information pollution, financial barrier, and
internet illiteracy more than urban students (Table 6).

Information overload 120/302 (39.74)38/119 (31.93) 82/183 (44.81)

The following suggestions are made for optimum
utilisation of internet:


The authorities should take immediate steps to
establish browsing centres in all rural and urban
colleges with fast internet connectivity. The adequate
facilities in terms of space, staff, and technology
(number of computers, etc.) should be available for
maximum utilisation of internet sources and services.
The rural colleges shouldnt be ignored in any
condition as it can widen the gap of digital divide.



Majority of the students were frequent users of the
internet, using internet ranging from daily to weekly in
which urban students were more than their rural
counterparts.

The internet facility should be extended to libraries,
reading rooms, and hostels to increase internet
access and usage.



Majority of the students used internet at commercial
cyber cafes, followed by home and college,
respectively. Rural students mostly used internet at
their homes whereas urban students mainly use
Internet at commercial cyber cafes.

Rural students do not have adequate internet facilities
in their localities. There is a need to establish more
commercial cyber cafés, community information
centres in towns and information kiosks in villages to
overcome this problem.



The administrators and information professionals
should take adequate steps to make students aware
about the proper use of the internet and make their
use focused and purposeful.



Internet sources like e-journals, e-books,
encyclopaedias, dictionaries, wikis, blogs, etc., are
not highly used by the rural and urban students. The
student should be made aware about these sources
and their impact on educational achievements through
internet literacy programmes.



Library and information professionals should make
themselves aware of the open access resources like
repositories, digital libraries, databases, directories,
and others using which they can access quality
information free of cost.



Library and information professionals should take
appropriate steps to make the students aware about
how to find relevant information from the internet. For
this purpose, the need is to conduct workshops to
train them in internet searching. The workshops
should focus on internet search tools, techniques,
and tips. The students should be made aware about
the search tools like search engines, subject-specific
search engines, gateways, portals, metasearch
engines, directories, invisible web search tools,etc.



Internet illiteracy (operating skills) is one of the major
problems that needs immediate attention. The training
programmes should be conducted to increase the
internet skills of the students. These programmes
should focus on all aspects of the internet literacy.

8. FINDINGS
The analyses of data reveal the following:








Most of students used internet for getting information
followed by education and communication,
respectively. Majority of the urban students used
internet primarily for information whereas rural
students mainly used internet for education.
Majority of students used e-newspapers whereas
other internet sources like e-magazines, e-journals,
e-books, encyclopaedias, and dictionaries were not
explored to a larger extent. Urban students used enewspapers and e-books more than the rural students
whereas rural students used e-magazines and ejournals more than the urban students.



Majority of the students used Google followed by
Yahoo. However, rural students used Google more
than urban students whereas urban students used
Yahoo slightly more than these rural students.



The students used, irrespective of regional
differences, web sources due to their up-to-date and
timeliness features.



The students faced various problems while searching
the internet. The widely faced problem was
information overload, followed by internet illiteracy.
Urban students faced information overload more than
rural students whereas rural students faced
information pollution, financial barrier, and internet
illiteracy more than urban students.

The expertise of library and information professionals
and information technology professionals need to be
tapped to conduct training and refresher courses for
students to make them internet literates. The special
programmes should be conducted for rural students
as the problem of internet illiteracy is more common
among rural college students.
