ABSTRACT
This study aims to ascertain the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy among the
library professionals of Calicut University. The study is confined to the library professionals in the central
library and departmental libraries of Calicut University. The method used for the study was a structured
questionnaire. The study reveals that the Professional Assistants are more ICT literates than the Junior
Librarians and Assistant Librarians. The use of ICT-based resources and services, library automation
software, and general purpose application software is high among the Professional Assistants than the Junior
Librarians and Assistant Librarians. The use of digital library and institutional repository software is very low
among the library professionals. Majority of the professionals had confidence in routine ICT and Internet tasks,
and need training or orientation in library automation, digital library and institutional repository software.

1. INTRODUCTION
Information and communication technology (ICT) is
the biggest achievement in the evolution of mankind. ICT
is any system designed to gather, process or distribute
information or it is the science and skill of all aspects of
computing, data storage, and communication. ICT may
be any combination of tools and procedures that
facilitate
the
generation,
acquisition,
storage,
organisation, searching, retrieval, and transmission of
information using electronic means1. ICT fundamentally
changes the access, storage and dissemination of
information, and facilitates global interconnectivity, and
accelerated information exchange2. ICT literacy is the
ability to use digital technology, communication tools,
and/or networks appropriately to solve information
problems including the ability to use technology as a
tool to research, organise, evaluate, and communicate
information and the possession of a fundamental
understanding of the ethical/legal issues surrounding the
access and use of information3.
There is a growing concern over library
professionals’ insufficient level of ICT literacy. The ICT
literacy skills, necessary for library professionals in the
emerging knowledge driven society, are continuously

changing. Library professionals in developed countries
moved quickly to learn and adopt new information
technologies. They raised their level of knowledge of new
information technologies through continuing education
programmes, professional training, and through revisions
in their library and information school curriculums4.
However, application of ICT is posing a particular
challenge to library professionals in developing
countries. Despite the high penetration rate of ICT and
exponential growth of Internet, many library
professionals in India lack the ICT literacy skills.
University of Calicut, the second university to be set
up in Kerala, came into being in 1968 with the objective
of developing human resources in the northern districts
of Kerala by extending the reach of higher education and
promoting research in all areas of development with
particular emphasis on technology, art, and culture of
Kerala. The University has a fully-computerised Central
Library and 28 partially computerised departmental
libraries. The Central Library has a fairly good ICT
infrastructure including a very active INFONET Centre.
Generally university libraries are positive towards library
automation and application of ICT in library operations
and services. However, no library can render ICT-enabled
services without qualified and competent library

professionals. ICT literacy is very essential for being
productive information professional in a knowledge driven
society. The present study attempts to investigate the
ICT literacy among the library professionals of Calicut
University.

2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE
There have been many studies focused on different
aspects of ICT literacy. Safahieh and Asemi5 assessed
the level of computer literacy skills of librarians in
University of Isfahan, Iran. The investigation revealed that
majority of the librarians did not posses a good level of
computer skills and even their long experience of
computer use had not necessarily improved their level of
computer literacy. Choudhury and Sethi6 analysed the
computer literacy of library professionals in the
university libraries of Orissa. The study showed that
majority of the professionals were computer literates and
majority of them opined that they should be provided
orientation for the use of electronic resources. Haneefa7
discussed the ICT training in special libraries in Kerala.
The study revealed that majority of the special libraries
in Kerala provided different types of training facilities to
their staff and users. For all types of training methods,
self-learning through reading manuals/documentation
and in-house workshops were the most common training
methods used. Rekabdarkolaei and Amuei8 evaluated
differences in ICT literacy among trainee student and
teachers from the view of sexuality.
The study showed that no significant differences
were found between females’ and males’ previous
experience
with
ICT.
Korobili,
Malliari,
and
Christodoulou9
investigated
the
attitudes
and
perceptions of Greek librarians regarding information
literacy programmes. It revealed that most libraries did
not delivered information literacy programmes, but some
kind of library instructions. Many respondents
considered that more money, more librarians and an
appropriately equipped space were the best ways to
improve information literacy programmes. Haneefa1 found
that most of the special libraries in Kerala were
hampered by lack of funds, lack of infrastructure, and
lack of skilled professionals to embark on automation of
all library management activities and application of ICT.
Adeyoyin assessed the ICT literacy level among
the staff of Anglophone (English speaking) university
libraries and their counterparts in Francophone (French
speaking) university libraries in West Africa. The results
showed that out 370 professional librarians only 179
were ICT literates while the remaining 191 professional
librarians were ICT non-literates. Only the 40 Senegal
university professional librarians had an ICT literacy level
of 100 per cent. Adomi and Anie11 conducted a survey to

assess the computer literacy skills of professionals in
Nigerian university libraries. The study revealed that
most of the respondents did not possess a high level of
computer skills but their use of computers and
technology was maturing. A majority of them acquired
their computer skills from computer/IT training
programmes, and used library automation software more
frequently than other software packages and used the
computer for personal purpose than for library routine.
In another study, Adeyoyin12 assessed the level of
ICT literacy among the library staff of Nigerian university
libraries. Analysis of the data showed that out of 268
professional librarians, only 87 were ICT literates. Okiy13
reviewed the state of ICT application for information
provision in Nigerian university libraries. It revealed that
the obstacles militating against effective application of
ICT in the university libraries were inadequate funding,
inadequate electricity supply, and shortage of competent
manpower for operation and maintenance of ICT
facilities. Ramzan4 conducted a survey of 244 librarians
in Pakistan to assess their attitude towards the
application of information technology (IT). The study
revealed that awareness of the potential of Information
Technology,
recency
of
attaining
professional
qualifications, and knowledge in IT had a significant
relationship with librarians’ attitudes towards the
application of IT. The study also revealed that librarians’
level of knowledge in technology is a good predictor of
their attitude towards application of IT in libraries.
In general, computer literacy and ICT literacy are
studied and discussed at different levels. However, there
is a little research that focuses on the ICT literacy of
library professionals in developing countries like India.
No comprehensive study of ICT literacy of library
professionals across the country has been undertaken.
Thus, there are still gaps in this area that are open for
future research. This study provides an insight into the
current ICT literacy of library professionals in the
universities of third world. This paper will enable library
professionals of universities in India to intensify their
efforts to enhance the ICT literacy.

4. METHODOLOGY

young Professional Assistants possess more formal and
informal computer education than the Junior Librarians
and Assistant Librarians. No professional possessed
MCA, BTech or MTech degrees in Computer Science.
PGDCA was the highest qualification possessed by the
professionals. Very few professionals possessed
diploma in computer applications. The professionals
need to improve their formal and informal computer
education. The senior professionals need to take
necessary steps to enhance their ICT literacy by
attending workshops and training programmes.

To meet the specific objectives of the study a
quantitative research methodology along with a
comprehensive literature review were employed. The
study population comprised of library professionals
working in the Central Library and departmental libraries
of Calicut University. Sixty-nine library professionals
were identified for the study. But despite several
attempts, one library professional did not replied. The
library professionals were classified according to their
designation into four categories: 42 (61.5 per cent)
Professional Assistants, 10 (15 per cent) Junior
Librarians, and 16 (23.5 per cent) Assistant Librarians.
Structured questionnaires were prepared and distributed
to these library professionals. The data collected
through the questionnaires were converted into machinereadable form and imported into the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences SPSS. The data were analysed
and inferences were made based on standard statistical
methods. Analysis of the data provided an in-depth
interpretation for fulfilling the four research objectives.

ICT literacy can be enhanced effectively through
relevant and contextual use of ICT technologies14. The
library professionals were asked whether they use any
of the ICT-based resources/services/tools. Table 2
shows that the use of ICT-based resources and services
was high among the Professional Assistants than the
Junior Librarians and Assistant Librarians. The library
professionals need to improve the use of various ICTbased resources, services, and tools so that they can
provide effective information services to their library
users.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

5.3 Use of Software

5.1 Types of Computer Education Possessed
by the Library Professionals

Library professionals must be proficient in the use of
software like operating system, library automation
software, and digital library and institutional repository
software. Efficient use of software enables effective
computer based information services. Different types of
software used by the library professionals in Calicut
university and the responses are summarised in the
following sections.

The library professionals were asked to indicate the
type of computer education possessed (Table 1). The
data reveals that 27 (40 per cent) professionals, 7 (17
per cent) Professional Assistants, 7 (70 per cent) Junior
Librarians and 13 (81 per cent) Assistant Librarians,
possessed informal computer courses. Twenty-two (32
per cent) professionals, 18 (43 per cent) Professional
Assistants, one Junior Librarian and 3 (19 per cent)
Assistant Librarians possessed short-term computer
courses. Twelve (18 per cent) Professional Assistants
like DCA course. Seven (10 per cent) professionals
possessed PGDCA course. Table 1 shows that the

to introduce open-source operating systems like Linux.
The platform for most of the open-source library
management and digital library software is Linux. It will
be better to network the libraries with Linux operating
system, and the University should provide training to the
library professionals in Linux operating system.

and Assistant Librarians. Koha was the widely used
open-source integrated library management software.
Eighteen (43 per cent) Professional Assistants were
using Koha software. The University should encourage
the use of open-source-software for library automation
and organise workshops and training in open-source
library management software.

5.3.3 Use of Digital Library and Institutional
Repository Software
The library professionals were asked whether they
use any of the digital library and institutional repository
software. The analysis from the Table 5 shows that the
use of digital library and institutional repository software
was very low among the professionals. The library
professionals should take initiatives for the development
of digital libraries and institutional repositories in their

training for the design and development of digital
libraries and institutional repositories.

5.3.4 Use of General Purpose Application
Software
The library professionals were asked whether they
use any application software for general purpose.
Table 6 indicates that MS Word is the most widely used
application software for general purposes among the
library professionals. The use of application software for
general purpose is high among the Professional
Assistants than the Junior Librarians and Assistant
Librarians. A large majority of the Professional
Assistants use MS Word and Excel software. Majority
of the Junior Librarians and Assistant Librarians use MS

resources and services were very low. A few
professionals used these resources and services almost
every day.

Resources and Services

5.5 Confidence in Handling ICT Tasks
Confidence is a pre-requisite for effective use of ICT
and therefore the library professionals were asked to
state their level of confidence in handling ICT tasks
(Table 8). They were provided three categories of tasks
including routine ICT tasks such as opening, saving,

Internet tasks such as downloading files, writing and
sending e-mail, attach a file to an e-mail message, and
high level ICT tasks such as creating presentation,
using spreadsheet, using database, constructing
webpage, finding computer viruses and creating
computer programs. The analyses shows that a large
majority of the professionals are confident in routine ICT
tasks.

5.5.1 Confidence in Handling Internet Tasks
Internet literacy is a subset of computer literacy,
which is generally defined as the basic knowledge,
skills, and attitudes needed by all citizens to be able to
deal with computer technology confidently in their daily
life15. The Internet skills are becoming very important for
all library professionals as more and more library
operations and services can be performed more
effectively by using the Internet. The library
professionals were asked to indicate their confidence in
handling Internet tasks. Table 9 reveals that a large
majority (87 per cent) of the professionals can get into
the Internet and write and send e-mail very well by
themselves.
Majority of the professionals can copy/download
files from Internet (72 per cent), attach a file to an e-mail

message (68 per cent), and download music (56 per
cent). Ten (15 per cent) professionals can copy/
download files from Internet with the help of others.
Eight (12 per cent) professionals know what attach a file
to an e-mail message means, but they can’t do it. A few
(18 per cent) professionals don’t know what download
music from Internet means.

5.5.2 Confidence in Handling High-level ICT
Tasks
The library professionals were asked to indicate
their confidence in handling high-level ICT tasks. Table
10 reveals that about half of the professionals can use a
database (56 per cent) and create a presentation (51 per
cent) very well by themselves. A good number of the
professionals can use a spreadsheet (40 per cent) and
use a software and get rid of computer viruses (34 per
cent) very well by themselves. A few of the professionals
can create a multimedia presentation (29 per cent),
construct a webpage (24 per cent) and create a
computer program (18 per cent) very well by
themselves. A few (18 per cent) professionals can use a
database, create a presentation, and use a spreadsheet
with the help of others. It was found that majority of the
professionals are not very much confident in handling
high-level ICT tasks.

5.6 Training or Orientation Needs in ICTbased Resources and Services

6. CONCLUSION

Training is an integral component of staff
development and well-organised institutions have staff
development as a central hub in their personal policies.
Training makes an important method of professional
development in an organisation, and enables its people
prepared for various operations. Training is expected to
bridge the performance gap. Training in ICT-based
resources and services is very important because it
helps in rendering value added services to the users.
The library professionals were asked to indicate their
training or orientation needs in ICT.
Table 11 shows that 54 (79 per cent) library
professionals indicated the need for training in digital
library and institutional repository software; 45 (66 per
cent) on library management software; 34 (50 per cent)
in evaluation of online information resources; 29 (43 per
cent) in Internet tools and techniques; 26 (38 per cent)
in search techniques and strategies, and use of online
catalogue; and 22 (32 per cent) professionals in use of
e-journals, e-books, databases and bibliographic
resources. Majority of the Professionals Assistants (62
per cent), Junior Librarians (70 per cent) and Assistant
Librarians (75 per cent) needed training in library
management software. A large majority of the
Professional Assistants (88 per cent) and majority of
the Junior Librarians (60 per cent) and Assistant
Librarians (69 per cent) needed training in digital library
and institutional repository software. The data indicate
that the existing ICT training and orientation provided by
the Calicut University library are not fully sufficient to
create ICT literacy among the library professionals.
Majority of the professionals needed training or
orientation in library management, digital library and
institutional repository software.
Table 11.

The findings of the study show that the young
Professional Assistants are more ICT literates than the
Junior Librarians and Assistant Librarians. Though the
library professionals claim that they use different ICTbased resources and services, the frequency of use of
these resources and services was very low. The ICT
literacy levels of the professionals were much influenced
by the levels of ICT use in their libraries. The library
professionals need to enhance their level of ICT literacy.
The University should provide state-of-the-art ICT
infrastructure including hardware, software and eresources with full-fledged Internet access. The library
professionals should be provided with more chances of
formal training to introduce all possible ICT-based
resources and services that can improve their ICT
literacy.
The present library and information science curricula
in universities in India are not supporting the appropriate
skills and expertise to be able to handle the application
of ICT. ICT literacy skills need to be integrated
appropriately into the curricula to ensure improved ICT
literacy.
Introduction of open-source software has great
promise for universities in developing countries. Most
universities in third world may find it difficult to take
advantage of open-source initiative due to lack of skills.
The university authorities need to look into this matter
and should make efforts to enhance the ICT skills of
their professionals. The Calicut University should take
initiative to introduce open-source software for the
design and development of automated library system,
digital libraries, and institutional repositories. The library
professionals should intensify their efforts to enhance
the level of confidence in high-level ICT tasks.
