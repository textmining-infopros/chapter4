ABSTRACT
This study analyses the world research output on Semantic Web during 2001-2010, using Scopus
database. It describes the overall growth pattern, publications share and citation impact of different
countries. It analyses the characteristics of most productive institutions, authors and highly-cited papers.
The patterns of research communication in most productive journals are also indicated.
Keywords: Semantic Web, World publication output, scholarly information

1. INTRODUCTION
The scholarly information arena offers researchers
an ever-increasing array of resources, including library’s
catalogues, databases, full-text resources, digital
repositories and Web pages. For accessing these
resources, it is necessary to have knowledge of the
various resources, their access mechanisms and the
query interface they provide. It even requires a manual
comparison between the results returned from several
resources and does not enable the user to move from one
resource to another for further discovery and navigation1.
Significant efforts are under way to address these issues,
not just for scholarly information but also for all Webaccessible data. The increasing interest in Web
information retrieval led to the Semantic Web initiative.
The term Semantic Web was coined by Tim BernersLee2, the inventor of the World Wide Web and Director of
the World Wide Web Consortium, which oversees the
development of proposed Semantic Web standards.
The Semantic Web is a "web of data" that enables
machines to understand the semantics, or meaning, of
information on the World Wide Web2. It extends the
network of hyperlinked human-readable web pages by
inserting machine-readable semantic annotations or
metadata or about pages and how they are related to
each other, enabling automated agents to access the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(4)

Web more intelligently and perform tasks on behalf of the
users. ''The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an
extension of the current one, in which information is given
well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and
people to work in cooperation according to Berners-Lee,
et al."2
The Semantic Web vision involves the sharing and
processing of data by automated tools as well as by
people. The central idea of the Semantic Web is to extend
the current human readable web by encoding the
semantics of web-resources in a machine interpretable
form, and then automatically integrating data from
different sources for performing actions on behalf of the
user and to search for information based on its meaning
rather than its syntactic form. It provides a common
framework that allows data to be shared and reused
across applications, enterprise and community
boundaries. This vision requires new and advanced
methods, models, tools and systems for services related
to creation, access, retrieval, integration and filtering of
web-based contents.
The Semantic Web is similar to tagging systems the
individual use in blogs to help search engine to find topics
and pull them up. Blog tagging, however, is decided by
individual tagger. Similar meta-tagging systems are used
to identify web pages to search engines. Meta-tags for
253

web pages in fact are descriptors of the entire page or
even the entire site. Tags, however, may not describe the
discrete data on the page. Other tagging systems are
based on extensible mark-up language (XML), from
which web formatting code (HTML) is derived. XML
tagging systems define at the beginning of a document
what the tags will mean within the document. One can tag
words, phrases and data for formatting and data search
purposes. XML provides an elemental syntax for content
structure within documents, yet associates no semantics
with the meaning of the content contained within3-4.
Several formats have been designed for Semantic
Web to meet this goal, among which the Resource
Description Framework (W3C, 1999) from the W3C and
Topic Maps (ISO, 1999) from the International
Standardisation Organisation aim at describing
resources and establish relationships among them.
Resource Description Framework (RDF) starts with selfdescription of data that other tagging systems use, but
RDF names each item and relationship between items in
a way that allows computers and software to exchange
them automatically.
It works best when groups agree to common
schemes. However, groups can be of any size, which
means that tagging is decentralized and does not require
agreement across user groups. RDF uses a triple
descriptor—a noun, verb and object, generally called a
Universal Resource Identifier (URI). RDF can be
enriched with a RDF Schema (RDFS) which expresses
class hierarchies and typing constraints, e.g. to specify
that a given relation type can connect only specific
classes. The semantic tagging provided by RDF and
Topic Maps may be extended by references to external
knowledge coming from controlled vocabularies,
taxonomies and ontologies3-4.
An ontology is an abstract model which represents a
common and shared understanding of a domain5.
Ontologies generally consist of a list of interrelated terms
and inference rules and can be exchanged between
users and applications. They may be defined in a formal
way, from natural language to description logics. The
Web Ontology Language (OWL) belongs to the latter
category. OWL is built upon RDF and RDFS and extends
them to express class properties. OWL establishes the
relationship of concepts within the data sets, which allows
this relationship to be translated across other databases.
Web ontology language that can formally describe the
semantics of classes in the domains of interest and the
semantics of properties (or attributes) is used in Web
documents. Ontologies provide richer integration and
interoperability of data and permit the development of
applications that search across diverse communities or
merge information from them. Ontologies are like a
library classification, which have to be structured so that
254

they are recognizable in the RDF. Metadata and
ontologies are complementary and constitute the
Semantic Web's building blocks. They avoid meaning
ambiguities and provide more precise answers. In
addition to a better accuracy of query results, another
goal of the Semantic Web is to describe the semantic
relationships between these answers.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this study is to analyze the
research performance in Semantic Web, as reflected in
its publications output during 2001-2010. In particular,
the study focuses on the following objectives: (i) To study
the research output, its growth, and global publications
share and impact of various significant countries, (ii) To
study the publications productivity and impact of leading
institutions and authors, (iii) To study the characteristics
of highly cited papers and (iv) To study the patterns of
research communication in most productive journals.

3. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCE OF DATA
This study is based on the publications data in
Semantic Web retrieved from the Scopus Citation
database for the 10 years (2001-2010). The search
strategy/keyword used to retrieve the data on Semantic
Web is as follows:
(((TITLE-ABS-KEY("semantic Web") OR TITLE-ABSKEY("web of data")) AND PUBYEAR AFT 2000 AND
PUBYEAR BEF 2011))
The search using the above keywords becomes
finally our main string. For citations data, three years,
two year and one year citations window has been used
for computing average citations per paper for Semantic
Web research publications during 2000-2007, 2008 and
2009. For analysing institutional, authors and journals
output, the separate search strategies for generating
institutional, author and journal outputs were developed,
which later combined with the main string to generate the
desired output. For generating high-cited papers, the
main string is first run. Then, the tag "citation to" is
ticked, which rearranges the entire output in the
decreasing order of citations received by each paper
with most high-cited papers at the top. Then the highcited papers are marked and downloaded for analyses.

4. ANALYSES AND RESULTS
4.1 Overall Publications Output and Impact
There were 11846 papers published world over on
Web Semantics during the last ten years, from 2001 to
2010. These papers have grown at an annual average
growth rate of 75.90 per cent. In terms of cumulative
output, the research output on Web Semantics has
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(4)

increased from 2279 papers in 2001-05 to 9567 papers
in 2006-2010, showing a growth rate of 319.79 per cent
(Table 1). On further breaking the research output by
source, 5736 papers appeared in conference
proceeding, 3198 in book series, 2851 in journals, 56 in
trade publications and 5 as books. On analysing the
citation impact (as measured on a three year citation
window) of overall publication output, it was found that
over the years the citation impact has come down. It is
not consistent, because the field is still developing and
yet to mature. The average citation impact of all papers
during 2001-2010 was only 1.87 (Table 1).
