ABSTRACT
In India library automation began in the late 1970s in a few special libraries and has now reached most
of the university libraries. It has yet to take off in college libraries in Karnataka owing to various problems.
Many studies on library automation have been undertaken in the developed countries, but few have been
undertaken in India. This study is a survey of engineering college libraries that have computerised their
operations and services in Karnataka. The study is limited to the automated libraries of engineering college
libraries in Karnataka. It gives a status on the software packages used by the various libraries, and opinions
of the librarians about the performance of the different modules of the software they have used.
Keywords: Library automation, serial control, Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC), software modules,
engineering college libraries, Karnataka.

1. INTRODUCTION
Library automation, which started in India in late
1970s in few special libraries, has now reached most of
the academic libraries.1 Computerisation was started in
the libraries to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of
the library operations and services. Development and use
of information and communication technology (ICT) has
enabled the libraries not only to offer their clientele the
appropriate information available within their libraries but
also provide access to information of other libraries, both
local and outstations.2 In the current scenario there is a
greater responsibility on the libraries and information
centres to provide the latest and timely information to their
users to facilitate improvement in the quality of education
in the country and this cannot be done until each
institution has an efficient library and information
management systems at its command.3
Library automation systems are elaborately designed
and crafted computer applications that require
considerable programming skills together with an
extensive knowledge of the functional needs of libraries
and the exacting standards that are applied in their
libraries. Software technologies used in library

automation systems include database management
systems, client-server architecture, search engine
technology, and, increasingly, software used in webbased applications.4

2. RELATED LITERATURE STUDY
Most of the literature in this area speculates on the
integrated library software and their effective use in
libraries. Design and development activities of library
software packages began during the mid 1980s in India
with the promotion of UNESCO’s CDS/ISIS by the
National Information System on Science and Technology
(NISSAT). From the experience of its use, some libraries
and information centres subsequently developed their
own software. Selection of suitable package is now a
problem due to lack of good, and up-to-date comparative
studies. Saxena and Srivastava recommend Sanjay for
smaller libraries, and Suchika, Granthalaya and Libsys
for larger ones.5 Another study provides an understanding
of the challenges confronted by the National Informatics
Centre (NIC) in the scale and scope of the deployment of
e-Granthalaya. NIC proposed a web-based online library
service connecting public libraries in India and integrating
library services in a “single window access”. There is a
13

need of a model for the automation, networking, and
federating of resources for other groups of libraries in
India.6 Yogendra Singh analysed the various factors that
directly or indirectly affect the progress of library
automation such as management issues, resources
available with the libraries, level of skill of staff, availability
of suitable software, geographic location, the areas in
which automation has taken place and role played by the
INFLIBNET, and found that things were changing for the
better as library automation in academic libraries is now
being regarded as an urgent need.7
Another study, carried out by Husain and Ansari,
discussed the effectiveness of library services including
efficient organisation and retrieval of information
activities.8 Since the application of information technology
in libraries, one of the greatest challenges before the
library managers has been the selection of a good library
automation software, which can cater to the needs of a
particular library. Authors found that though a number of
Indian as well as foreign software companies had entered
the market, only a couple of library automation software
packages gained success in making their presence felt.
Their study also discussed the salient features of
cataloguing module of three such packages, namely,
Alice for Windows, Libsys, and Virtua and their
acceptability in a developing nation.8 Harinarayana and
Raghavan examined the comparative retrieval
effectiveness of the two packages, viz., CDS/ISIS and
LibSys. A set of eight well defined parameters were
employed to compare the two packages. The result
showed that neither of the two packages provides support
for all the features expected of an ideal retrieval software.
They found some significant difference between CDS/ISIS
and LibSys in terms of their ability to provide desirable
features; there was a difference of 9.34 per cent in the
levels of performance of the two packages.9
Libraries, librarians, and college administrations must
initiate automation to provide effective and efficient
services to users. Library professionals must upgrade
their skills to meet the growing expectations of users from
libraries. Many studies on library automation have been
undertaken in the west, but few have been undertaken in
India. Bansode and Periera tried to identify the status of
library automation in college libraries of Goa.10 Another
survey covered various aspects of library automation such
as information technology infrastructure, in-house
activities, information services and their usage. Suku and
Mini briefly described the role of INFLIBNET Centre in
accelerating the automation activities of university
libraries, especially in the context of the recently
introduced UGC-INFONET programme.11 Mukhopadhyay
discussed the development of library management
software over the past decades, the characteristics and
trends of software with special reference to packages
available in Indian environment and compared services
and facilities incorporated in library automation packages
14

available in India against various checklists.12 The
developments of library management software over the
years and availability of open source software for library
management have emerged as viable alternative to
commercial closed products. Mukhopadhyay found Koha
as the most feature rich library automation software in the
domain and report development of Unicode-complaint
Bengali version of Koha for college libraries and public
libraries in West Bengal.13 There were many similar
results in the other studies, however, differences in the
direction of effects between different studies, attributed to
different sampling methods or to the methodology
adopted, should be kept in mind.

3. NEED AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
Literature survey showed that there is no detailed
study carried out on the library software packages in
engineering college libraries. It was also observed that
some of the engineering college libraries in Karnataka are
well equipped and providing better library services to the
users by using modern library software packages. The
study was undertaken to collect first-hand data from all
engineering colleges in Karnataka and present the status
of their library automation. The study focuses on
adequacy of library management softwares and brings out
the inadequacies if any.
The main aim of the study was to explore the
problems faced by engineering college libraries in using
integrated library software packages for automating
various operations. The specific objectives were:
±

To know the supportive infrastructure facilities
available for library automation in engineering college
libraries.

±

To know which library software was being used by the
libraries of engineering colleges in Karnataka.

±

To examine the extent of usage and performance of
various modules of library software in engineering
colleges of Karnataka.

±

To record the experiences of librarians and library
staff in accessing these integrated library software.

4. METHODOLOGY
The opinions of librarians regarding library softwares
were elicited using a structured questionnaire followed
with interviews. Opinions on different issues pertaining to
the library housekeeping operations were sought from the
respondent libraries. The questionnaires were mailed to
128 engineering college librarians in the Karnataka. Out of
these, 102 (79.69 per cent) were received duly filled with
all the relevant information requested in the questionnaire.
However, geographically the scope of the study is limited
to colleges located in the state of Karnataka only.

Table 1 gives the list of all engineering colleges
covered under the study. A five-point scale was used to
measure the opinions of the respondent librarians.
Hierarchical cluster for variables-cluster method-Ward’s
method, dendogram were also used for analysing the
data. The SPSS 15.0 for Windows evaluation version was
used for statistical analysis.

Both harware and software are essential along with
some basic component without which it can not function
smoothly. Keeping in mind the first objective of this study
the researcher wanted to know the infrastructural facilities
available for automation at the surveyed colleges. Table 3

5.4 Status of Library Automation in
Engineering College Libraries
Automation provides the means to offer new improved
services to its patrons. The automated library functions
are acquisition, cataloguing, classification, circulation,
serials control, bill payment, budgeting, reminders and
reference services.
The status of library automation in engineering
colleges of Karnataka is shown in Fig. 1. Out of 102
respondent libraries, 88 (86.27 per cent) libraries were
automated.

module are functioning 100 per cent in respondent
libraries, 90.91 per cent of libraries are using OPAC
module functions. Twenty-two libraries are using
automated module functions like acquisition, 22 (25.00
per cent) and 19 (21.59 per cent) libraries are using
serials control module. The reasons could be attributed to
different practices followed by respondent libraries.

5.8 Opinions About the Usage and
Performance of Software Modules
Opinions of the respondents about the different areas
of usage and performance of modules, i.e., administrative, catalogue, circulation, OPAC, acquisition and
serials control were weighted based on the scale for
usage, like 5 = 30 (high usage), 4 = 25 (good use), 3 = 20
(fair use), 2 = 15 (average use), and 1 = 10 (least usage).
Scale for performance, i.e., 5 = 30 (excellent), 4 = 25
(very good), 3 = 20 (good), 2 = 15 (average), and 1 = 10
17

(below average) and calculated scales equally distributed
to calculate weight. Further, these weights were
subjected to cluster (C1, C2, C3, C4) analysis (Ward’s
method with Interval Squared Euclidian method) to draw
Dendograms for the modules. The Dendograms are:

performance of a catalogue module. More parameters
clustered in the second (C2) group signifies the usage
and performance of a catalogue module among the
librarians.

5.8.3 Circulation Module
5.8.1 Administrative Module
Different clusters among the respondents were rated
for usage and performance of administrative modules
(Fig. 2). Fourth cluster (C4) parameter was rated stand
independent against usage and performance of
administrative module. More parameters clustered in third
(C3) group signifies the usage and performance of
administrative module among the respondents.

Different clusters rated are shown in usage and
performance of circulation modules in Fig. 4. In the first
and fourth clusters (C1, C4), two parameters; issue of nodue certificate and reporting lost items stand independent
against usage and performance of circulation module.
More parameters clustered in the second (C2) group
signifies the usage and performance of library software’s
circulation modules among the librarians.

5.8.2 Catalogue Module

5.8.4 OPAC Module

Different clusters rated for usage and performance of
catalogue modules are shown in Fig. 3. In the fourth
cluster, only one parameter supports the complex
documents that stand independent against usage and the

5.8.5 Acquisition Module
Different clusters rated for usage and performance of
acquisition modules are shown in Fig. 6. In the fourth
cluster, only one parameter routing and bindery
preparation, stands independent against usage and
performance of acquisition module. More parameters
clustered in first group signifies the usage and
performance of acquisition modules among the
respondent librarians.

5.8.6 Serial Control Module
Different clusters rated for usage and performance of
serial control modules are shown in Fig. 7. It is observed
from the Fig. 7 that the first cluster parameters stand
independent against usage and performance of serial
control module. More parameters clustered in second
group signifies the usage and performance of serial
control modules among the respondents.

6. FINDINGS AND SUGGESTION
±

It was observed that 14 libraries lack computer
facilities. However, six libraries’ management is not
interested to spend amount for automation. Only two
libraries are suffering from lack of trained manpower.

±

It was observed that serial control and acquisition
modules were being used by less librarians because
acquisition process was different from software to
software and from library to library.

±

Most of the libraries were having good IT infrastructure
and other accessories.

±

To be the part and parcel of library information system
development process, library staff should respond to
the developments in technology; they must keep upto-date with technologies available, they must
evaluate technologies, so that they can make
informed decisions about using these technologies,
and are able to develop practical plans for
implementing these technologies.

±

±

Upgrading the core competencies of staff, alongside
library’s automation system not only enhances the
professional competencies of the staff, but also
thwarts the intrusion of alternative information
providers into the information profession, and
The impact of library automation on services of
responded libraries has increased in terms of ILL,
users visit to library, circulation, and will be helpful in
building the appropriate collection.
