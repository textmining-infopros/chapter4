ABSTRACT
Open access publishing is growing in importance, and, in parallel, the role of institutional archives
has come to the forefront of discussion within the library community. The present study is an attempt to
analyse the present trend of institutional archives worldwide. The factual data of each individual
repository was collected from various Directories of Institutional Repositories by using survey method.
Data was analysed in terms of quantity of institutional archives increased during last six years, countrywise contents of institutional archives, types of materials archived, subject coverage, software used,
language of interface of institutional archives, host domains, and policy of institutional archives. The
results of the study suggest healthy growth in terms of quantity of institutional archives' increase
worldwide, however, the development is more prevalent in developed countries than developing countries.
The subject analysis of the institutional archives indicates that the contributors in the field of health and
medicine are more interested to submit their materials in repositories. Currently the institutional archives
mostly house traditional (print-oriented) scholarly publications and grey literature, using DSpace software
and most of these materials were of English language. However, the policy of content inclusion,
submission and preservation is yet to be well defined in institutional archives.
Keywords: Open access, institutional archives, information and communication technologies

1. INTRODUCTION
One of the more recent developments in the field of
scholarly communication is the trend towards open
access (OA). OA holds promise to remove both price and
permission barriers to the scientific communication by
using Internet. In fact, OA is a step ahead of "Free
Access", which removes the price barriers by providing
free access to end users. OA removes the permission
barrier as well. There are two ways for researchers to
provide OA to their work-by publishing their articles in OA
journals or by depositing copies of their subscriptionjournal articles in open archives [known variously,
depending on circumstances, as e-print archives,
institutional archives (IAs) or institutional repositories].
According to Wikipedia, an IA may be defined as an
online locus for collecting and preserving—in digital
form—the intellectual output of an institution, particularly
a research institution1. For a university this include

materials such as research articles before (pre-print)
and after (post prints) undergoing peer review, and digital
versions of theses and dissertations. But it might also
include other digital assets generated by normal
academic life, such as administrative documents, course
notes or learning objects. An IA is a collection of digital
research documents such as articles, book chapters,
conference papers, and data sets. E-prints are the digital
texts of peer-reviewed research articles, before and after
refereeing. Before refereeing and publication, the draft
is called a "pre-print". The refereed, accepted, final draft
is called a "post-print". The term e-prints include both
pre- and post-prints.
With the increasing use of information and
communication technologies (ICTs) and availability of
open sources softwares most of the institutions are
maintaining such repository or archive to collect,
preserve, and make accessible all the intellectual product
317

created by the scholarly communities of that institutions.
Main objectives for having an IA are:


To create global visibility for an institution's scholarly
research



To collect content in a single location



To provide access to institutional research output by
self-archiving it



To store and preserve other institutional digital
assets, including unpublished or otherwise easily
lost ("grey") literature (e.g., theses or technical
reports).

Institutional archives are now become an important
new player in the field of academic information
management and publishing. The development and
growth of IAs arose in response to the major changes in
scholarly communication. The new form of scholarshipthat is born digital-constitutes an important source for
present and future research and teaching. With the
emergence of the World Wide Web (WWW) as an
effective vehicle for publishing and distributing, the borndigital form of scholarly objects becomes more popular.
Additionally, the rapid rise in the cost of commercial
scholarly journals was another major impetus in
developing new models in scholarly publishing. IAs
benefit scholars by providing free access to all scholarly
works published or likely to be published in near future. It
reduces the gap of 'backlog' by bringing timely access,
and increases visibility through freely accessible Web.

2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF
INSTITUTIONAL ARCHIVES
With the development of ICTs, a number of
alternative strategies to the traditional scholarly
publishing system have evolved. Among these, IA model
promises to be extremely advantageous to peers
everywhere, especially to those who have acute shortage
of resources for purchasing scholarly literature. The
impetus for IAs was boosted by the Open Society
Institute (OSI) in a small meeting convened in Budapest
on 1-2 December 2001. The purpose of the meeting was
to accelerate progress in the international effort to make
research literature in all academic fields freely available
on the Internet2,3. The first major international statement
on OA, which includes a definition, background
information and a list of signatories, is the Budapest
Open Access Initiative. The other two leading statements
are the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing
and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge
in the Sciences and Humanities. The conception of OA in
these three statements, which is often called the BBB
(Budapest, Bethesda and Berlin) definition, launched,
318

inspired, and continues to guide the OA movement.
Although institutionally-based, or more typically
departmental, 'archives' were known before this,
especially in areas such as computer science and
economics that were served by NCSTRL and RePEc,
respectively, OAI introduced the Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting (OAI-PMH) to provide common services that
could operate over more general, independent sites4. IA
adopt the same OA and interoperable framework as eprint archive, but rather than being discipline-based,
represent the wide range of research output of a given
university or research organisation. The term was coined
by Scholarly Publishing for Academic Resources
Coalition (SPARC), and has been defined by SPARC as
"digital collections capturing and preserving the
intellectual output of a single or multi-university
community"5.Crow argues that institutional digital
repositories will lead to significant increases in the
prestige of the institutions that build them6. Stephen
Harnad also cites institutional prestige: "Distributed,
institution-based self-archiving benefits research
institutions in three ways. First, it maximises the visibility
and impact of their own refereed research output.
Second, by symmetry, it maximises their researchers'
access to the full refereed research output of all other
institutions. Third, institutions themselves can hasten the
transition to self-archiving and so more quickly reduce
their library's annual serials expenditures to 10 per cent
(paid to journal publishers for refereeing their
submissions)"7. Pinfield, Gardner, and MacColl also
argue that an e-print archive can raise the profile of an
institution8.
Growth in the number of IAs has accelerated since
2002. Despite some lag in time, there has been
corresponding growth in terms of number of digital
content in IAs, as revealed by the Registry of Open
Access Repositories (ROAR, http://roar.eprints.org/).
Among repository directories, "on 31 December 2006,
OAIster (launched in 2002) listed 726 OA, OAI-compliant
repositories worldwide; with an increase of 25 per cent
than previous year. In 2006 OAIster listed a total of
6,255,599 records from the repositories it covered9.
ROAR is one of the authentic sources that identify
repositories worldwide. With the increasing popularity of
OA materials from worldwide, number of IAs are
increasing continuously. There has also been extensive
investigation of the role of various types of repositories in
the scholarly communications process, particularly in the
context of e-prints and author self-archiving, and even,
more recently, with respect to institutional policies about
author self-archiving; however, these studies really don't
illuminate the full range of developments surrounding
institutional Archives planning and deployment10. To the
best of our knowledge, there has been relatively little
systematic examination of the actual state of deployment
of IAs across the world. It is, therefore, important that a
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(4)

study be undertaken with the sole purpose of identifying
the present status of IAs worldwide.

3. OBJECTIVES

4. METHOD USED
Since the study was planed to analyse the growth
and development of IA, survey method was found
suitable. Our investigation began with one of the most
authoritative online directories: ROAR. Additionally, we
also looked Directory of Open Access Repositories
(OpenDOAR: www.opendoar.org) and OAIster to identify
other IAs not identified by ROAR. The access policy for
all the directories was checked to know whether all the
materials of the aforesaid directories were available free,
or partially free. The factual data in terms of number,
country of origin, document types, subjects, software
used, language, host domain and policy of individual IAs
were noted for further analyses.

5. RESULTS

(up to 15 October 2010)

In the next step attempts were made to count the
distribution of IAs by country. As mentioned in Table 2
highest number of IAs are now in the United States (373)
followed by United Kingdom (181), Germany (141). Here
we have listed only first 14 countries having more than 30
IAs individually. Overall, there are as much as 9097162
number of documents available in all these IAs with an
average of 5151 documents per IA. The number of IAs
per country differs widely both in number of IAs and in
average number of documents. As Table 2 shows that
United States is also the leader in terms of total number of
documents in IAs and average number of documents per
IA. It is important to note that Germany got 3rd position in
terms of number of IAs but the average number of
documents per IA is the lowest in all fourteen countries
listed in the table. On the other hand Norway drops to
13th position in terms of number of IAs but secured 5th
position in terms of average number of documents per
IA. Rest of world has 471 IAs with 17.65 per cent of the
total number of documents.

5.1 Growth of Institutional Archives
First, we were tried to find out the growth in number
of IAs over the years, but it was observed that a large
number of IAs did not mentioned their year of
establishment. Therefore, we took data, prior to 2007,
from an earlier study conducted by Hitchcock et al.11,
and from 2007 onwards from the OpenDoar. This data is
based on date of registration in the aforesaid directory.
Since the directory was created in 2006 the previous
data of growth was not available.
Table 1 shows the growth of IA during 2005-2010 (up
to 15 October 2010. In 2005 there were 578 IAs which
rose to 726 in 2006, 988 IAs in 2007 and 1284 in 2008
with an addition of 148, 262 and 296 IAs between 20052006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, respectively. This
number reached to 1586 at the end of 2009 with an
addition of 302 IAs between 2008-2009. At the time of
writing this paper, this number touched 1766 with an
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(4)

5.3 Types of Contents
Table 3 shows the types of content currently stored
in archives. It was observed that although various
categories of contents are archived in IAs, the main
focus of the holdings of current IAs is on journal articles
(36 per cent) followed by conference and workshop
papers (19 per cent), unpublished reports and working
papers (17 per cent) and books or chapters/section of
books (11 per cent). These unpublished records include
electronic theses and dissertations, digitised special
collections materials, course materials, etc.

5.4 Subject Coverage of Institution Archives
The subject coverage of the IAs and number of
documents under each subject is quite interesting. We
identified prominent 29 broad subjects. The same is
shown in Table 4. As indicated in Table 4 the most

Note: Number of IAs and records may put in more than one subject category, as a result total
number exceeds to the real number of archives and records as mentioned in Table 2.

prominent unique subject under which most of the
records archived was health and medicine (12.40 per
cent of the total), followed by chemistry and chemical
technology (9.18 per cent of the total). Although, the
number of records and number of archive under heading
'multidisciplinary' is quite high, the result does not
represent any conclusion. Because the subject
multidisciplinary is the combination of number of
subjects, and to calculate the proportion of unique
subject to the total was a complex task. It is interesting to
note that the number of archives in the field of arts, social
science like history and archeology (105 IAs), social
science general (88 IAs), law and politics (77 IAs), etc.,
were quite considerable. Whereas, the number of
documents in the IAs of humanities/social science
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(4)

discipline were quite low than science discipline. The
number of science documents is currently far higher
than that of in humanities/social science disciplines.

5.5 Software Used
Considerable variation was found while examining
the software used to support IAs. As mentioned in Table 5
D-Space is the most used (624 IAs) software in IAs. This
was followed by E-prints (291 IAs), Bepress (99 IAs),
and Digital Commons (75 IAs). A large number of IAs
(311) did not mentioned the name of software they used.
Besides the list of software shown in Table 5, there are
many institutions which used locally developed systems
or content management systems to set up an IAs.

5.7 Institutional Archives according to Host
Domain
This study also distinguished IAs on the basis of
their nature of host organisation (Table 7). All IAs were
grouped into the four categories: Aggregating, i.e., an
archive aggregating data from several subsidiary

repositories; Disciplinary, i.e., a cross institutional
subject repository; Govern-mental, i.e., a repository for
governmental data; and University-based institutional,
i.e., an institutional or departmental archive. It was
observed that maximum number of IAs (1440) were
university-based institutional, followed by disciplinary
(212) and aggregating (74).

5.8 Policies for Institutional Archive
An IA is driven and directed by its policies, which
determine its identity, quality and direction. It is not
sufficient to create an archive merely by putting software
on a machine. An archive's organisational model is the
sum of its policies and an archive without policies is like a
library without a librarian12. The principal policy
concerns of IA, which are important to know, are its: (i)
Content policies: type of material to be submitted; (ii)
Submission policies: who would authorise to submit
material in the IA; (iii) Preservation policies:maintaining
for future use. We tried to find out above mentioned
policies for every IA in terms of content policy,
submission policy and preservation policy. It was not
possible to visit URL of each IA to know the status. So we
took relevant data from OpenDOAR. The following
parameters were identified to know the status of IAs
policies:


If we were able to find policy information, the status
is set to 'Defined'.



In some cases, there may be a slot for the relevant
policy, but all it says is 'not yet defined'. In these
cases we set the status to ‘Undefined’.



If there is information on policies, but the particular
policy is not covered, the status is set to ‘Unstated’.



If we were unable to find any policy information at
all, the status is set to ‘Unknown’.

41

Note: Total number exceeds with the actual number due to interface
of same IAs in more than one language.

5.8.1 Policy for Content
Table 8 shows that 78 per cent of IAs do not have a
well defined policy for the types of records to be
deposited in these IAs. Only 19 per cent of IAs have
defined policy regarding types of material to be
submitted, whereas around 4 per cent found unstated.
No policy information regarding type of contents was

5.8.2 Policy for Submission
Similarly, it is important for an IA to make it clear that
who will authorise to submit material to the IA and what
are the term and conditions of submission of an item.
Table 9 shows that around 77 per cent of IAs do not have
a defined policy for the submission of documents. Only
19 per cent of IAs has defined policy for the same. It is
unstated for 3 per cent and unknowns for 1 per cent.

whereas 52 per cent of IAs do not make a clear policy for
the preservation of documents. Thirty-eight per cent of
IAs did not gave any information regarding preservation
policy their status is unstated. It may be observed from
the above results that about 17 per cent IAs have made
clear policies for type of content, submission and
preservation. It is a good start and in near future this gap
would reduce.

6. DISCUSSION
While comparing the size of archives between
institutions is clearly a very complex problem, probably
intractable in the short term, it would be relatively easy to
collect estimated rate of repositories growth, which would
be helpful in understanding the landscape. From the
growth of IAs since last six year, one may visualise the
professionals’ growing eagerness towards making their
scholarly research openly accessible. Only in few years
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(4)

span, the volume of literature has already increased
manifold and this explosion still continues. So it is a great
challenge for an e-publisher to archive these huge
electronic data for future. At the same time, based on the
number of IAs established over the past few years, the IA
service appears to be quite attractive and compelling to
institutions. IAs provide an institution with a mechanism
to showcase its scholarly output, centralise and introduce
efficiencies to the stewardship of digital documents of
value, and respond proactively to the escalating crisis in
scholarly communication13. The phrase “if you build it,
they will come” does not yet apply to developing
countries in context of establishing IAs. While their
benefits seem to be very persuasive to developing
countries, most of IAs are still in developed countries. An
overwhelming number of items from developed countries
may need to put critical insight into the ways in which
various nations are thinking about the role of institutional
repositories. In fact, the problem, ‘resource-crunch’ is
more acute in developing countries than developed
countries. However, the efforts from developed countries
are appreciable than other countries. When we analysed
these IAs according to types of materials it includes, the
result of our findings suggest that currently the
institutional archives mostly house traditional (printoriented) scholarly publications and grey literature:
journal and conference articles, books, theses and
dissertations, and research reports. From this we can at
least speculate that OA issues in scholarly publishing
may well be the key drivers of institutional archives
deployment, at least in the very short term, rather than
the new demands of scholarly communications related to
e-science and e-research.
On analysing the distribution of subjects in these
archives, it may be concluded that the author of the
subjects like health and medicine, chemistry and
chemical technology, biology and biochemistry, etc., are
more interested to disseminate their findings to the wider
audience. Due to that, a large number of materials were
open accessible to the IAs. It is quite evident that the field
‘science’ is changing very fast than other discipline and
obsolesce of concepts are more prevalent in science
discipline. Additionally, the traditional journal system is
heavily affected by the problem of backlog. So,
submitting materials to IAs before actual publication
helps author to disseminate their findings at faster rate.
The relatively low-quantity of documents in the field of
social sciences and humanities may be an indication that
awareness about submission of scholarly text in OA
archives amongst humanities/social science academics
is not enough, or, they do not find it worthwhile to submit
their scholarly text in IAs. However, they perceive many
advantages to depositing their work in institutional
archives, especially for the reader, not for themselves.
The use of Dspace as one of the leading software in
these IAs may be due to the fact that DSpace code
323

already supports self-publishing and self-archiving
features. One can rely heavily on DSpace for
preservation, metadata, persistent URLs, etc., 14.
Similarly, most of these materials were of English
language, is a clear indication that English is the major
language in scholarly communication. When IAs were
analysed according to host domain, it was found that
university-based institutions are the leading type of
domains.
The finding of the present study may supports the
vision of Stephen Harnad that: “Universities need to
mandate the self-archiving of all peer-reviewed research
output in order to maximise its research impact for
exactly the same reasons as they currently mandate
publishing it.”15. He also argued that OA self-archiving to
be mandated by research funders and institutions so that
the self-archiving of published, peer-reviewed journal
articles (Green) can be fast-forwarded to 100 per cent
OA. On the other hand, analysing the policy of IAs, it
became clear that still the policy of content inclusion,
submission, and preservation are not well defined. There
is a need to establish standard policy so that IAs can be
used further for information exchange worldwide.

7. CONCLUSIONS
Institutional archives are now clearly and broadly
being recognised as essential vehicle for scholarship in
the digital world. This is evident based on the continuous
growth of IAs around the world. The continued
development of IA depends a great deal on our
continuing to overcome cultural barriers to their
acceptance and use. At present, the most popular
concept of archive is post-print archive. So, it is now time
for universities of the nation to establish such archive to
make their digital collections available and simultaneously
to overcome the access barriers within the particular
permanently language periphery. At the same time
researchers, lecturers and practitioners within
institutions need to convince the value and immense
potential of IAs. It may be expected that the next few
years will see growing connections between IAs as
infrastructure and the broader issues that are emerging
about strategies and infrastructure necessary to support
the management, dissemination and curation of research
data (at the national, disciplinary and institutional levels).
