ABSTRACT
Open source movement plays a vital role in the development of open education resources in higher
education. Open source e-learning courseware (OSeLCW) is an initiative within this movement. Many institutions
today post their courses for free and open access via the Internet to users all over the world. This paper
assesses the awareness, access, and utilisation of such wealth of web-based OSeLCW among educators
and students of engineering colleges in Mysore city.
Keywords: E-learning, web-based learning, open educational resources, open courseware, open source e-learning

1. INTRODUCTION

2. OPEN COURSEWARE MOVEMENT

The Open Educational Resources (OER) movement is
rapidly growing in the higher education environment.
Within this movement, open courseware (OCW) is an
initiative that finds its origin in the free open source
software approach1. The United Nations (UN) has shown a
great concern towards OCW and OER aiming to bridge
the digital divide between and within nations.

The OCW movement was initiated in 2001 by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA. Later,
leading institutions world wide joined this OCW
movement, like Tokyo Institute of Technology (TITECH),
Japan; Utah State University (USU), US; Korea University,
Korea; USQ, Australia; TU Delft, Netherlands etc. Today
there are more than 200 institutions and organisations
around the globe running OCW websites and they have
formed OCW Consortium. This consortium plays a vital
role to advance education and empower people worldwide
through open courseware4. Some of the OCWs are:

The concepts behind OCW are deeply integrated in
the UN millennium declaration and the universal
declaration of human rights2. OCW offers an alternative
view of the future of educational technology and the
learning content to be delivered thereby—a future in which
more time, money, and effort are spent getting learners in
touch with high quality instructional contents; and less
time, money and energy are spent worrying about digital
rights management and stopping pirates3. According to
OCW consortium, an open courseware is a free and open
digital publication of high quality university-level
educational materials, often including syllabi, lecture
notes, assignments, and examinations, organised as
courses4. The courses are made freely available for
educational purposes that users across the world can
use, reuse, redistribute and adapt the materials under
open licenses like creative common license.

2.1 MIT OCW
MIT OCW is a large-scale, web-based electronic
publishing initiative. Through OCW, MIT makes its core
teaching materials openly available for educational
purposes only. MIT publishes these materials in standard
formats for users having access to the Internet anywhere
in the world. MIT now has 1,800 courses already posted
on its OCW website. MIT OCW is being translated into
other languages like Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese,
German, Vietnamese, etc. under the special arrangement
with MIT, and in some other cases MIT has agreed to let
institutions create mirror sites at their locations5.
43

2.2 TITECH OCW
TITECH OCW is an imitative website carried out by
TITECH to provide free access to course materials for
users around the world. The aim is to release the Tokyo
Tech’s high-level educational resources on science and
technology as the world’s public property6.

The objective of the study was to understand the level
of awareness among educators and students in
engineering colleges of Mysore city, about the four
websites that offer free and open e-learning course
materials relevant to computer science and engineering
education and to assess their access and utilisation by
these educators and students.

2.3 Utah State University OCW

4. METHODOLOGY

Utah State University (USU) OCW project is carried
out by the USU, USA. The idea behind USU OCW is to
post course materials for open access free of charge, as a
model for sharing knowledge in the Internet era. The
courses are written by faculty and are meant for teaching
of undergraduate and graduate subjects. They are also
useful to advanced technology-enhanced education in the
Utah State University and at the global level7.

The questionnaire with different scales was used as a
tool to assess three different aspects, viz., awareness,
access, and utilisation of OCW and VTU e-learning
courseware websites. This was primarily meant for
students. Another questionnaire meant for educators was
designed to elicit opinion about the helpfulness of these elearning course materials in designing course syllabi, and
integration of open course materials for classes they
teach.

2.4 Visvesvaraya Technological University
e-learning Courseware
Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) is a
leader in engineering education in Karnataka. In August
2003, VTU established an e-learning centre to facilitate
distance education and training to the students and
faculty of VTU via satellite and Web. VTU e-learning
website provides e-learning courseware (eLCW) in the
form of lecture notes as well as tech-specific courses.
The lecture notes are viewed as supplementary materials
for the distance education program conducted by VTU.
The tech-specific courses aim to empower the studentlearner to develop his/her technical skills with current
technology to meet the needs of the hour for different
companies and industries8.

3. OBJECTIVE
OCWs are available free on the Web for educators,
students, and self-learners all over the world. There are
many OCWs, which help students and teachers for their
study and teaching. The course materials available at
MIT, TITECH, and USU websites cover largely the
computer science and engineering course curriculum of
BE programmes offered by the VTU. A comparative study
of VTU course curriculum and MIT’s OSeLCW revealed
similarity between them, and these OCW course
materials are expected to be of much use to VTU
students and educators as well. This motivated the
authors to assess the awareness, access, and utilisation
of OCW and VTU e-learning course materials among
educators and students of computer science and
engineering at engineering colleges. The study gains its
importance in the light of the utility of OER and OCW for
educators and students in enhancing the quality of
teaching and learning in higher education and thereby
produce globally competitive graduates and also in
designing course curriculum to suit global competition.
44

Data were collected during February and March 2008
from educators and BE students of sixth and eighth
semester of computer science and engineering students
studying in five engineering colleges, namely, the National
Institute of Engineering (NIE), Sri Jayachamarajendra
College of Engineering (SJCE), Vidya Vardhaka College
of Engineering (VVCE), Geetha Shishu Shikshana
Sangha Institute of Engineering and Technology for
Women (GSSSIETW), and Vidya Vikas Institute of
Engineering and Technology (VVIET) in Mysore city. The
details of questionnaires distributed and filled in
questionnaires received from educators and students are
detailed in Table 1. Data in the filled questionnaires were
coded, tabulated, and analysed using statistical package
for the social sciences (SPSS). Statistical methods like
chi-square test, contingency table analysis and F ratio
were employed to describe the awareness, access, and
utilisation of OSeLCWs.

4.1 Awareness among Students and Educators
about OSeLCWs
Table 2 gives the frequency and per cent responses of
the students’ and educators’ awareness about
OSeLCWs, and results of contingency coefficient tests.
Contingency coefficient (CC) test revealed a
significant association between awareness and websites
(CC=0.478; P=0.000). This type of trend was found to be
similar for educators (CC=0.426; P=0.000) and students
(CC=0.494, P=0.000), where awareness was found to be
maximum for VTU and least for USU. However,
individually when verified about the awareness of each
website, no significant difference was observed between
educators and students, i.e., the X2 value between
educators and students using OSeLCW of MIT, TITECH,
USU and VTU is .397, .024, 2.086 and .025 respectively.

non-significant difference (F=3.52; P=.061), where
educators’ mean is 0.78 and students mean is 0.99.
However, the mean score of the students compared to
educators in downloading from VTU courseware is high
and hence the difference is significant (F=5.464;
P=0.001).

differences were found between USU and TITECH
websites. However, between educators and students, a
non-significant difference (F=0; P=0.992) may be
observed, where educators (mean 0.53) and students
(mean 0.53) had similar mean scores. The comparison
between educators and students in respect of obtaining
printouts from websites was found to be non-significant
(F=1.26; P=0.289) indicating that pattern of getting print
out from various websites is same for educators and
students.

4.5 Helpfulness of OSeLCWs in Designing
Course Curriculums
OSeLCWs have been prepared keeping in mind the
development at global level. Experts from top class
institutions are involved in preparing these resources.
There are 22 educators in five colleges involved in
teaching computer science and engineering subjects.
Keeping the contents of OSeLCWs in mind educators in
concerned subjects were asked whether these
OSeLCWs were of help to them in preparing course
curriculum. Table 6 presents frequency and scores of
educators’ responses about the utility of OSeLCWs in
designing curriculum.

4.4 Downloading Files/Modules
The mean score and standard deviation of
downloading files from OSeLCW by the educators and
students (and results of 2-way ANOVA) is provided in
Table 5.
The two-way ANOVA was used to analyse the
respondents’ views about downloading files/modules from
various websites to their local discs. The analyses reveal
a significant difference between various websites
(F=30.71; P=0.000), where the mean score of students
and educators downloading from VTU website is highest
(mean 1.90) and this is followed by MIT (mean 1.13),
TITECH (mean 0.46) and USU (mean 0.30) which has the
least mean score. The comparison of overall mean

Table 6 exhibits that there are eight educators out of
22 who have expressed that the VTU OSeLCW was
helpful in designing and developing curriculum of their
courses. Among them five have expressed that VTU

OSeLCW was helpful to some extent, two have
expressed that it was moderately helpful, and one said
that it was helpful to a great extent. They represent 22.7
per cent, 9.1 per cent, and 4.5 per cent of the total
educator respondents, respectively. Remaining 14
respondents, representing 63.6 per cent, have found
these resources not at all useful for designing course
curriculums.
Nineteen out of 22 educator respondents expressed
that the MIT OSeLCW was helpful in designing course
curriculum. Among them 6 have said it is helpful to some
extent, 8 expressed that it was helpful to moderate
extent, and 5 said that it was helpful to a great extent.
They represent 27.6 per cent, 36.4 per cent, and 22.7 per
cent, respectively. Remaining three educators,
representing 13.6 per cent of the total, have opined that it
was not helpful. With regard to TITECH and USU
OSeLCWs, large majority (86.4 per cent and 95.5 per
cent) educators have expressed that they were not helpful
for them in designing course syllabus. It may be observed
from the table that there exists significant association
between various OSeLCWs and the extent of their
helpfulness to educators in designing course curriculum
as the contingency coefficient is 586 (i.e., CC =0 .586)
and the P value is 0.000 (i.e., P= 0.000).

4.6 Integrating Contents of OSeLCWs with
Lecture Notes

Twenty-one out of 22 educator respondents stated that
they have used MIT’s OSeLCW in preparing lecture
notes. Out of these 21 educators 7 have used this to a
great extent, 10 have used to a moderate extent, and 4
have used to some extent. They represent 31.8 per cent,
45.5 per cent, and 18.2 per cent of the total respectively.
Remaining only one educator representing 4.5 per cent of
the total has said that he has not used the MIT’s
OSeLCW for preparing lecture notes. The large majority of
educators have not used OSeLCWs of TITECH and USU.
They represent 86.4 per cent and 95.5 per cent of the total
respectively.
Thus, it may be observed from the table that these
exists significant associations between different
institutions’ OSeLCWs and their usage by the educators
in preparing lecture notes. As the contingency coefficient
is 0.618 and P value is 0.000 (i.e. P=.000).

5. DISCUSSION
The results of the study reflect maximum awareness,
access, and creation of offline resources (copying and
getting print out) from the VTU followed by MIT, TITECH,
and USU websites respectively by respondents. VTU
course materials are much more cited because VTU is
the highest body to prescribe syllabi for technical
institutions in Karnataka.

Educators involved in teaching computer science and
engineering courses were asked to furnish their opinion
as to whether they used and integrated OSeLCWs in
preparing lecture notes and if so the extent of their usage.
Table 7 presents frequency of faculty responses and their
percentages.

A significant observation this study brings out is that
unlike students, educators download more files from MIT
OSeLCW than VTU eLCW. It is observed that course
materials offered by MIT OSeLCW are more useful to
educators so they go beyond VTU eLearning materials.
This is a positive attitude on the part of educators as MIT
OSeLCW has highly sophisticated scholarly materials.

Table 7 demonstrates that there are eight out of 22
educators who used the contents of VTU’s OSeLCW in
preparing class notes. Out of these eight educators three
(13.6 per cent) each have expressed they have used the
same to some extent and to a moderate extent, and two
(9.1 per cent) have said that they have used the same to a
great extent. Remaining 14 educators representing 63.6
per cent of the total have expressed that they have not
used the VTU’s OSeLCW in preparing lecture notes.

With respect to adapting syllabi and lecture notes by
educators to develop their own course syllabi and
courses’ content, the findings reveal that no significant
associations were observed between websites and
categories of responses. Educators adhere to a certain
policy of education which makes them restricted to a
specific syllabus. In other words, they are syllabus-driven
that make them uninterested to look into OSeLCW
materials of other institutions/agencies.

To increase the awareness and utilization of
OSeLCWs, sensitization and information literacy
programmes have to be made by libraries and information
centres cooperatively with educational administrators to
motivate educators and students to use and adapt such
high quality scholarly materials as OSeLCWs in their
curricula. Students are syllabus-oriented, which makes
them unable to go beyond it. In other words they are
overloaded with the syllabus which does not give them
chance to look for further opportunities to enhance their
knowledge.

6. CONCLUSION
Overall, the findings show that the respondents had
maximum awareness, access, and creation of offline
resources of eLearning materials of VTU followed by
OSeLCWs of MIT, TITECH, and USU. For better
utilization of OSeLCWs, educational administrators and
faculty members have to work together in collaborative
manner in adapting and integrating OSeLCWs materials
in their curricula and learning. Adapting OSeLCWs by
higher education institutions will lead to improvement in
the teaching and learning process and thereby produce
globally competitive graduates and post graduates.
