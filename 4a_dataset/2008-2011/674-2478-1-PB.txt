ABSTRACT
The coming of the World Wide Web has propelled vigorous growth of the electronic forms of
communication which simply does not fit into the traditional publishing format. With the coming age of eJournals, there has been total transformation in the way scholarly communication is disseminated throughout
the world. The use of e-journals saw a big jump in later half of the 90s and is continuing to escalate. On an
average, one-half to nearly 100 per cent of the scientists in a field use e-journals at least part of the time. A
research survey was undertaken amongst the 16 prestigious aerospace organisations in Bengaluru. The
sampling boundary is restricted to these selected 16 organisations. Out of the 650 questionnaires distributed,
612 were received back, and finally 583 questionnaires suitable for the study were selected. The analysis is
based on the responses from the aerospace scientists and engineers. The major observations include: (i)
aerospace engineering e-Journals are extremely important to aerospace scientists or engineers and are a
major source of scientific and technical information, (ii) the use patterns of aerospace engineering e-Journals
amongst the 16 aerospace organisations are not uniform and hence show a heterogeneous nature in their use
patterns. Also, the most preferred aerospace engineering e-Journals in the order of priority and usage (from
the responses received) by this ‘niche’ aerospace engineering community are: Aerospace Science and
Technology; Progress in Aerospace Sciences; Journal of Aerospace Engineering; IEEE Transactions on
Electronics and Aerospace Systems; Web of Science; Online Journals: Aerospace; Journal of Turbo and Jet
Engines; The Journal of Failure Analysis and Prevention (ASM International); European Space Bulletin–ESA;
Informatics–J Gate; and International Journal of Satellite Communications and Networking.
Keywords: Aerospace engineering, use patterns, e-Journals, Internet, World Wide Web, electronic scholarly
communication, information dissemination, electronic information resources

1. INTRODUCTION
The growth rate in usage of electronic information
resources is sufficiently high and if this trend continues
for few more years, a time may come when the print
versions will get ‘totally eclipsed’. The coming of the
World Wide Web has propelled this vigorous growth of
the electronic forms of communication, which simply do
not fit into the traditional publishing format. With the
coming of the age of the e-journals, the way scholarly
communication is disseminated throughout the world
has totally altered. questionnairesMany interesting
studies conducted on faculties, scientists, and
researchers have shown that journal and journals
articles continued to be valued resources.

According to Tenopir and King1, use of e-journals
saw a big jump in the last half of the 1990s and is
continuing to escalate. On an average, one-half to nearly
100 per cent of the scientists in a field use e-journals at
least part of the time. Scientists have revealed that
journal articles are highly important to their work, more
than any other information sources. Also, scientists are
spending many hours reading scientific literature.

2. SCHOLARLY COMMUNCATION AND THE
COMING OF E-JOURNALS: A BRIEF
HISTORY
Tenopir and King2, opine that until the late 17th
century, communication amongst scholars depended
31

heavily upon personal contact and by attending
meetings organised by the learned societies (e.g. The
Royal Society). As the membership of the learned
society grew, and as many could not attend the
meetings, so the proceedings became a place to publish
papers that could not be presented in the meetings
eventually evolved into scholarly journals. The initial
peer-reviewed journals were the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society and Journal de
Scavans both published in 1665. The coming of the 19th
century saw an explosion in the number of journals
produced, due to increased specialisation and
diversification of academic research, and also evolution
of the means of mass publishing (using cheap wood
pulp-based paper). Elsevier Scientific Publishing began
publishing engineering journals way back in 1884. After
the World War II, Robert Maxwell set up the Pergamon
Press which pioneered move towards mass commercial
publishing. By 1960, commercial publishers had
occupied a major part of the market. Although, the first
prototype e-journal was in 1976, the booming time for
the e-journals was during 1990 to 1995, mainly
dominated by non-profit making groups who exploited
the technology for their own sake. If Gutenberg’s
invention of the printing press in the 15th century was a
great leap towards information dissemination, then
invention of the World Wide Web is equally a great leap
towards electronic scholarly communication, Harnad3,
has rightly opined that ‘the arrival of the electronic
communication is the fourth revolution in the means of
production of knowledge’ after spoken language, written
language, and the printing press. Electronic journals are
full text or abstracts of journal articles available
electronically on the Internet or CD-ROMs4. Another
definition says, E-Journals are nothing but, “Electronic
versions of printed journals that can be viewed online via
any PC connected to the Internet”5.
Valauskas6, defines an “electronic journal” as a
digital periodical dedicated to publishing on the Internet,
articles, essays, and analyses that have been read and
commented upon initially by a select group of editors
and reviewers, to meet a certain standard of excellence
for a given discipline addressed by the journal itself”.
Medium distinguishes between electronic and print
journals. Very nature of electronic journals implies ample
opportunities for experimentation: fonts, format, layout,
design.

3. AEROSPACE AND DEFENCE RESOURCES:
PIONEERING INITIATIVES IN PROMOTING
THE USE OF AEROSPACE ELECTRONIC
INFORMATION RESOURCES
The Aerospace Information Management–UK (AIMUK) project found compelling evidence of ‘underutilisation’ of ‘electronic information resources’ by the
32

aerospace scientists and engineers. It recommended a
number of initiatives to raise awareness and improve
access to useful electronic information resources, and
to reduce the threat of ‘information overload’. In
particular, there was a call to establish an Internet
gateway and portal to the aerospace and defence
community that would act as a ‘jumping-off-point’ for
effective exploration and retrieval of information on the
World Wide Web. Aerospace and Defence Resources
(AERADE), launched in November 1999, was
specifically designed to meet this need. AERADE is a
pioneering initiative by the Cranfield University to enable
aerospace and defence experts to find relevant
information on the Internet. Today, the reports archive is
a historical collection of over 10,000 significant technical
papers and reports by the Aeronautical Research
Council (ARC) and the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics (NACA)7.

4. NATIONAL AEROSPACE LABORATORIES
AND ALLIED AEROSPACE
ESTABLISHMENTS IN BENGALURU
The city of Bengaluru, Karnataka, is considered the
‘Aerospace Hub’ of the India with many key aerospace
organisations like The National Aerospace Laboratories
(NAL); The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL); The
Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE); The
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); The
Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA). It also
comprises many key Indian Air Force establishments
like Air Force Systems and Testing Establishment
(ASTE); Air Force Technical College (AFTC); Institute of
Aviation Medicine (IAM).
In a nutshell, many of these organisations come
under the broad umbrella of Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR); Defence Research and
Development Organisations (DRDO); The Indian Air
Force (IAF); Educational Institutions like IISc; Major
public sector undertakings. All of these in their own way
have significantly contributed to a large number of Indian
aerospace programmes. The National Aerospace
Laboratories is India’s premier civil aviation R&D
aerospace research organisation in the country. Its main
mandate is to ‘Develop aerospace technologies with a
strong science content and with a view to their practical
application to the design and construction of flight
vehicles’. NAL is also required ‘to use its aerospace
technology base for general industrial applications’.
‘Technology’ would be its core engine-driver for the
future. NAL is also best known for its main sophisticated
aerospace R&D testing facilities, which are not only
unique but also comparable to similar facilities
elsewhere in the world. The present research survey was
an NAL initiative jointly with the Department of Library
and Information Science, University of Mysore. Today,
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(6)

every NAL scientist has access to online electronic
scholarly information right at his desktop. This has been
possible with the help of the National Institute of
Science Communication and Information Resources
(NISCAIR) through its CSIR e-conglomerate. Access has
been provided to almost 6,000 e-journals by tying up
with 23 international publishers. This facility enables any
CSIR scientist to access, browse, search and download
‘full-text’ journal articles from any computer system
connected to the campus-wide network. The present
proposed work studies the patterns of ‘full-text’
downloads of scholarly e-journals also.

5. LOCATING USEFUL AEROSPACE
ENGINEERING E-RESOURCES ON THE
INTERNET
The World Wide Web provides a plethora of
information for scientists and engineers working in
various disciplines. Aerospace engineers and scientists
largely refer to core aerospace engineering e-journals
from reputed publishers, off-line and online aerospace
databases, aerospace gateways, aerospace wikis,
aerospace patent services, aerospace portals, e-journals
from professional associations, open-access e-journals,
aerospace standards, aerospace indexing, abstracting
and
citation
services,
aerospace
conference
proceedings, aerospace blogs and aerospace theses
and dissertations, and aerospace monographs on the
Internet. It is observed that in many of the reputed
universities in the US, the concerned subject librarians
create their own e-resources websites, which contain
their photographs and contact e-mail address. These
websites form one section of the main website of the
concerned university. Innumerable hyperlinks are
provided to various e-resources concerning different
scientific and engineering disciplines. Table 1 is one
such extraction from the University of Minnesota Library
website which provides a gateway to a large number of
aerospace engineering e-resources to help the
aerospace engineering community to access them just
with the click of a mouse button. Many of the resources
indicated in Table 1 relate to Aerospace Engineering and
covers broad areas such as development, design,
construction, testing, and operation of aircraft and space
vehicles. It also includes aeronautics, aircraft, aviation,
astronautics, and space flight8. Many of the e-resources
indicated in Table 1 facilitates aerospace scientists and
engineers easy access to aerospace engineering ejournals for their scientific pursuits enabling them to
keep in touch with global R&D.

7. CONCLUSIONS
The main conclusions that authors would like to
draw from the study are the following:
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): was applied for testing
the significant difference among the 16 mean scores
attained from the scientists and engineers of the
aerospace organisations for ‘Frequency of Access and
Usage of e-Aerospace Engineering Journals’. It is
observed that all the 16 aerospace organisations show a
significant difference (P < 0.05) in their mean scores,
viz., Web of Science, Informatics J-Gate, European
Space Bulletin–ESA,
International Journal of Satellite
Communications and Networking, International Journal
of Turbo and Jet Engines, Journal of Aerospace
Engineering–ASCE, Progress in Aerospace Sciences,
Aerospace Science and technology, IEEE transactions
on Electronic and Aerospace Systems, Online Journals:
Aerospace and Journal of Failure Analysis and
Prevention–ASM International.
Summary of Total Scores on ‘Frequency of Access
and Usage of Aerospace Engineering e-journals’:
The summary of total mean scores obtained with regard
to the above is as follows. The highest mean score of
1.25 (CV=110.44) is obtained for the option Aerospace
Science and Technology. This is followed by a mean
score of 1.20 (CV=111.16) which is represented for
Progress in Aerospace Sciences. The third highest
mean score of 1.12(CCV=114.14) is reflected for Journal
of Aerospace Engineering. This is followed by a mean
score of 1.08 (CV=121.57), which is represented for
IEEE Transactions on Electronics and Aerospace
Systems. Web of Science follows up with the next
highest mean score of 1.01(CV=132.41). Online
Journals: Aerospace gets the next highest mean score
of 0.95(CV=129.23). This is followed by the Journal of
Turbo and Jet Engines which gets the next highest

38

mean score of 0.90 (CV=137.69). The Journal of Failure
Analysis and Prevention (ASM International) comes up
with the next highest mean score of 0.78 (CV=151.37).
This is followed by a mean score of 0.73 (CV=150.54)
which is represented by European Space Bulletin–ESA.
Informatics–Gate represents itself with a mean score of
0.72 (CV=160.02). Finally, the lowest mean score of
0.67 (CV=166.17) is reflected for International Journal of
Satellite Communications and Networking.
