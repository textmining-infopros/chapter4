ABSTRACT
Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is the first internationally classified retrieval tool designed for
bibliographic information and documentation. This paper discusses the history and the salient features of
the UDC, and what is the future for the software.
Keywords: Universal Decimal Classification, classification, MRF, auxiliary tables, citation order, Dewey Decimal
Classification

INTRODUCTION

The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is
known by many names such as European Dewey,
Brussels Classification, and the International Decimal
Classification. Since it was based on the Dewey’s
System, it was called Expanded Dewey in the beginning.
Nevertheless, it is the first truly international classification
designed for bibliographic information and documentation
work—all earlier systems were purely library classifications
with the purpose of shelf arrangement. Though a
retrieval tool, it is equally efficient as a library classification,
and tool for organising other entities and objects. It
has become a highly flexible and effective system
for organising bibliographic records for all kinds of
information in any medium, especially multimedia
packages.
UDC is a general classification scheme for all
fields of knowledge available in various languages.
All branches of knowledge have a place in UDC,
though traditionally it is considered stronger in science
and technology subjects.

BRIEF HISTORY

In 1895, some system of classification was required
by the then newly established International Institute
of Bibliography (IIB) [it was rechristened as International
Received 3 March 2008

Institute for Documentation in 1914; International
Federation for Documentation in 1958; and International
Federation of Information and Documentation (FID)
in 1986. FID was closed down in 2000 due to financial
failures.] Task of the IIB was to compile a universal
bibliography, a Repertoire Bibliographique Universal.
It needed a system for arrangement of entries in this
universal bibliography—a systematic list of technical
literature published anywhere in any subject and
language, and since antiquity. This bibliography could
only be in a classified order to transcend the language
barrier. By 1921, the IIB had collected 12 million
references on cards. Two Belgians, founders of the
IIB, Paul Otlet (1868-1944) and Nobel laureate Hernri
La Fontaine (1864-1943) sought permission from
Melvil Dewey (1851-1931) to use and expand Dewey
Decimal Classification (DDC) for arranging items in
the bibliography. They then developed an expanded
and powerful classification equipped with more details,
and added synthetic equipment for class-number
synthesis for microdocuments. They gave dimension,
depth, and flexibility to the DDC. It was credited as
the first faceted classification, a harbinger of the
Colon Classification (CC) in 1933 (though S R
Ranganathan claimed his classification independent
of the UDC). It has proved an apt classification for
information analysis and retrieval, especially for highly
specific subjects in documentation work.

First edition, based on the 5th edition of DDC
(1894), appeared in French between 1905-1907 under
the title Manual du Reperoire Universale. It comprised
33,000 classes. The 2nd edition, again in French,
was published during 1923-1933 and was titled
Classification Decimal Universalle. The 3rd German,
and 4th English editions were published in 1933 and
1936, respectively. Development of the UDC has
been divided into the following three historical periods
by Reyward:
French Period:
1895-1933

Foundation and grammar

German Period:
1933-1952

Details

English Period:
1936-1975

Research

International Period:
1990-

Technical and organisational
improvement

and

expansion

and

practice

The completed English edition, published in
numerous small fascicules, took half-a-century to
publish because of alleged neglect.

OTHER EDITIONS

Throughout its history, it has been made available
in editions of varied details. Till 1990, there were
full, medium, and abridged editions. Full edition
comprised over 2,00,000 terms, medium had 60,000
terms (about 30 per cent of the full) and abridged
had up to 20,000 terms (about 10 per cent of the
full edition). In addition to the earlier available full,
medium and abridged editions, abridged and pocket
editions in French, English, and Spanish were published
in 1998, 1999, and 2004, respectively. This format
was subsequently published in other languages (like
Russian and Croatian) also. Now, only standard
printed version of 67,000 terms, the pocket version
(also published as ‘abridged’) of 4100 classes and
the Spanish edition of 20,000 are officially available.
A new English pocket edition is underway by the
British Standards Institution (BSI), while a multilingual
pocket edition to be published by the UDC Consortium
is also being .
A standard version of the UDC, containing 67,000
classes, is maintained by the UDC Consortium and
is available in a database format. It is called the
UDC Master Reference File (UDC-MRF). Currently,
the main language of UDC-MRF is English, though
31,000 records are also available in German. The
UDC Consortium has plans to introduce a German
4

translation by 2010, and translation in other languages
such as Spanish, French, or Russian also. UDC
MRF database was created in 1993 in CDS/ISIS
software. Since then, UDC database exports (in ISO
2709), and simple text exports have been distributed
to the users in a file format. The UDC Consortium
does not publish or distribute the UDC-MRF in printed
format. The printed format as well as CD-ROM or
Web editions come only as products from different
publishers who are either members of the UDC Consortium
or pay-publishing license.
Since 1993, there were a number of editions in
various languages both printed and electronic (desktop
and online) (UDC Translations: A 2004 Survey Report
and Bibliography at http://dlist.sir.arizona.edu/649).

Natural Sciences; Mathematics

UDC is owned, managed, maintained, and distributed
by an international consortium of publishers with its
headquarters in The Hague. Its editorial team comprises
six Associate Editors lead by an Editor-in-Chief and
supported by the UDC’s Advisory Board of over 20
members. Salient features of UDC are:

6

Technology

7

The Arts

8

Language; Linguistics; Literature

9

Geography; Biography; History

(i)

(ii)

UDC is a practical bibliographic classification,
truly international in efforts and exposition of
contents. It is considered as the first faceted
classification and a synthetic classification which
is able to specify minute subjects, aspects,
formats and their varied viewpoints.
It is the first officially internationally used classification
system being published in French, German and
English.

(iii) Its notation is independent of any particular
language or script, and its translations have
appeared in about 39 languages.
(iv) It lays more emphasis on subject analysis and
document specification.
(v)

Its auxiliary apparatus of relations and synthesis
is quite powerful. This makes the UDC a truly
multidimensional scheme.

(vi) It is more suitable for microdocuments, electronic
information and information retrieval in online
and networked databases, and websites.
(vii) Its structure is flexible to accommodate new
subjects, and change citation order for flexibility
of shelf arrangement and searching.

ORGANISATION OF KNOWLEDGE
AND LAYOUT OF THE SCHEDULES

It is a general classification covering the whole
domain of knowledge. As already said, it has borrowed
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(6)

Unlike the DDC there is no condition of minimum
of three digits in a class number. Each of the main
class has been further divided into 10 divisions:
5

Natural Sciences

51

Mathematics

52

Astronomy

—

59

Zoology

There are thus 10 x 10 =100 divisions including
the vacant places. Similarly, the above 100 divisions
can be divided again into 1000 sections:

It entails that the special auxiliaries .02 and
.081 shown by sidelining 53 are applicable to all the
subdivisions of 53 Physics, e.g.

As it is clear from the above examples, two or
more auxiliaries can be added to a given class
number. The UDC follows the principle of inversion
that is, the order of facets in the class number is
reverse of their arrangement on the shelves. A broader
order is: Class number +Special auxiliaries + Common
auxiliaries. The common auxiliaries are to be added
in the order of their decreasing specificity, i.e., more
important or specific common auxiliaries are to be
added first and the least specific to be added last.
A mechanical formula for the citation order is that
the auxiliary tables should be added in the order 1k
to 1c.

However, no formulated order has been presented
for the special auxiliaries.

The UDC being a flexible classification the order
may be changed to have better sense or make some
local variations. Moreover to arrange documents the
shelled auxiliaries may be brought in the fore position.
For example, to bring all journals in one section we
could have numbers like

NOTATION AND LAYOUT

The UDC notation is a mix of decimal numbers,
punctuation signs, and symbols with permissible
use of alphabets, or other non-UDC symbols. The
7

use of decimal notation has made it a truly international
classification with many technical advantages. It is
hierarchical, expressive, hospitable, mnemonic, faceted
and synthetic. Layout of the abridged edition (2003)
explained here is that of the pocket edition (1999).
In this edition instead of verbal signs, following
symbols independent of language have been used
to give notes and instructions under an entry in the
schedules.

The symbols are for the convenience of presentations

These tables, both main and auxiliary, consist
of simple numbers and a few compound numbers–
later are a compilation of two or more numbers built
with linkage sign or auxiliaries. Such numbers are
indicated by à sign, e.g.,

INDEX

Current terminology uses British spellings and
idiom. In the index of the abridged edition there are
9500 main and 3500 subentries making a total of
13,000 entries contained in 107 pages. It gives an
average of three access points per entry in the
tables. Index entries culled from the electronic files
are arranged in word-by-word order to conform to the
BS ISO 999 Standard. Specific names are entered
following AACR 2 specifications. It includes all the
principal divisions, inclusion notes, common and
special auxiliaries and built-in compound numbers.
Collocation of terms depicts relations and qualifiers
8

are added to homonymous words to show the context,
e.g., axes (tools), 672.7; axes (plants), 581.4, or
line (art), 7.013. In case of a synonym all its popular
terms are indexed to avoid see-references, e.g.,
both Aves and Birds have been indexed. Index is
tidy and easy to use.

9.

MANAGEMENT, MAINTENANCE, AND
REVISION

Since the 1990s the UDC has undergone sea
changes in its technicalities, contents organisation,
and management. It has been completely rejuvenated.
The original FID/CCC, the committee in charge of
the UDC, was replaced in 1985 by the UDC Management
Board. On the recommendation of a Task Force
constituted by the Board, the FID (now defunct)
handed over the ownership of the UDC to the nonprofit, but self-financed UDC Consortium (UDCC),
which came into being on 1 January 1992. Since
2007, it consists of the publishers of the Dutch,
English, French, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and
Czech editions of the UDC (ww.udcc.org). It owns
markets, maintains, innovates, and keeps the UDC
updated10.
The office of the UDCC is housed in the National
Library of the Netherlands at the Hague and is a
managed by a Chairman. The first Editor of the
UDC, since the establishment of the UDC Consortium,
was Professor Ia. C. MacIlwaine (1993-2006), and
the present Chief Editor since June 2006 is Dr Maria
Ines Corderio. The UDC Advisory Board consists of
about 20 information professionals from all over the
world. Each of the Consortium members has the
right to issue UDC edition in its own language.
Language versions are not mere translations. These
are updated with local and cultural additions. The
BSI, a member of the UDCC, is responsible for the
English editions (www.bsi.org). A UDC discussion
list moderated by Dr. Andrew Buxton exists at UDCFORUM@JISCMAIL.AC.UK. <www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/
udc-forum.html>. It is a forum to get and share UDC
news and developments. UDC blog exists at http:/
/universaldecimalclassification.blogspot.com

9.1 Revision
The UDC revision is planned and regular. The
UDCC controls its development acting as an international
clearing house. It seeks help from specialists in
many subject fields. Normally revision proposals
are published in the Extensions and Corrections to
the UDC and comments and suggestions are invited
from users and the members of the Advisory Board
before finally being incorporated in the UCD-MRF.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(6)

With the appointment of the Editor with sole and
unlimited authority over revision for the first time
since September 1993, the pace of revision has
become quick. Users are informed of changes and
expansions in the annual publication, UDC: Extensions
and Corrections published every year in November
(the last issue is Vol. 29, 2007). This annual publication
also contains articles, major revision proposals and
a bibliography on the UDC. Changes to UDC are
introduced annually and the new UDC version is
released by UDC Consortium every January. Editions
of the UDC incorporating the authorised changes
are published by the members of the Consortium,
each in its own language, or by any outside publisher
licensed by the UDCC.

9.2 Problems
Despite its constant and enduring success, it
has been criticised on certain points:
(i)

Its DDC base has always been criticised.

(ii) Some notational devices, although apparently
logical and satisfactory, cause problems in searching
and browsing. e.g., symbols like – and 0 overlap
in function and may lead to confusion.
(iii) Its auxiliaries are still developing with changes
in some notational symbols.
(iv) There are certain citation order problems, as no
definite standard has been prescribed.
(v) Main class 4 has still not been filled up.
(vi) Notational changes are worrisome.

10. APPLICATIONS
In terms of its applications, now it is a most
diversely used tool, ranging from shelf classification,
organising bibliographies, web organisation to classification
of conceptual and material objects. Though the first
bibliographic classification, it is equally useful for
arranging documents, their surrogates and other
information bearing objects such as electronic files,
AVs, maps, CDs, art collections, photographs, coins,
stamps, and entities like persons, places and
organisations.
Today, UDC is ranked as one of the big three
most widely used classification systems of the world.
Technically, it is considered much superior to the
other two, namely the DDC and the Library of Congress
Classification (LCC). It is used in 125 countries of
the world, in over 1,00,000 libraries and information
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(6)

centres, especially in Europe and Latin America. It
is used as de facto standard for indexing of scientific
and research literature in central and European countries.
It is translated in 39 languages and is also used in
over 30 national, subject, and trade bibliographies
including Walford Guide. The abridged edition is
equally useful for teaching.
It has been a pioneer in finding its use in computerised
databases, and works extremely well with computers.
While its hierarchical structure and classified order
are useful for computer screen browsing, its hierarchical
and synthetic notation is helpful in accurate retrieval.
Online UDC allows multiple search facilities, namely,
string search in natural language, Boolean searches,
and browsing up and down the hierarchy. Its pioneer
use in OPACs has been successful. Since 1993, it
has been tested and applied in organisation of Internet
resources of many subject gateways, nine of which
are available in English (e.g. WAIS/WWW, NISS National Information Services and Systems; SOSIG
- Social Science Information Gateway; FVL - Finnish
Virtual Library; PORT - Maritime Information Gateway;
GERHARD - German Harvest Automated Retrieval
and Directory etc.), and since 2000 it has been
more frequently applied in national Web portals and
gateways in central and eastern Europe. In subject
gateways, it can be put to the following uses: Manual
classification of manual collection; manual classification
of large number of automatically harvested resources
by using metadata; and, automatic harvesting and
classification9.
It has emerged as an excellent source for building
other indexing languages, thesauri, taxonomies and
special classifications with its multilingual database.
It has the potential to act as a switching language
between different information systems.
The UDC has emerged as knowledge organisation
tool of high quality, easy applicability and international
validity.

10.1 Future
As said earlier, UDC has been criticised for its
DDC core and slow development. It has also been
remarked that the UDC had better not been invented,
yet it has not only survived but thrived in the bibliographic
world where mortality rate is high. Once introduced,
it not only works but performs better than many of
its competitors.
For a century, despite lack of adequate finance
and manpower, it has kept its head above waters.
It has rejuvenated itself with constant reorganisation
9

since the last two decades. It is coping with updating
by restructuring the knowledge using the frame work
of the Bibliographic Classification (BC-2)—latter is
much more up-to-date and better structured than
any other general scheme. Classes of religion, languages,
literature and history are now completely restructured
following the principles of facet analysis. The project
of restructuring of Class 61 (Medicine) on the principle
of facet analysis, undertaken by Nancy Williamson,
is now approaching its completion.
At the UDC Seminar (www.ulcc.org/seminar2007.htm)
in June 2007 at the UDCC Headquarter, a Dutch
software company Magnaview (www.magnaview.nl)
presented an innovative visual application of the
UDC, which makes possible to view the UDC MRF
in 20 novel ways with facility to interact it visually.
The software is commercially available from the
company for the MRF license holders. With its well
organised promotional network and keenness for
innovations the UDC seems only to have assured
long future.
