ABSTRACT
Indian Institutes of Technology are identified as premier institutes of higher education and research in
Technology in India. Having common goal, there is a need for cooperation among the libraries of the IITs. To
achieve this kind of co-operation, there is need to design and develop a unique type of library portals containing
resources and services of their individual libraries and also providing links to other IIT libraries. Further, there
is also need to form an educational network specialized among the IIT libraries.
Keywords: Content analysis, Web portals, Indian Institute of Technology, library, network

1. INTRODUCTION
Library portals have offered great opportunities for the
library and information professionals in higher education
sector to give their services to the users a real boost.
Semantic web has allowed users to search any kind of
information from a single library portal. Library portals not
only provide a gateway to an institution’s resources by
listing them for the users but also create direct links to the
native interface of each resource. Such listings are
available on most library websites today and provide
resources from the library as well as web. A typical library
portal acts as a single access point combining the library
catalogues, subscription databases, subject gateways,
electronic journals etc.1 The main benefits of the portal
are easier access to users, simplified authentication,
unified presentation of quality resources, personalization,
and the portal may be a mechanism by which to offer
services to an institutional portal or VLE, so keeping the
library in the forefront in larger initiatives in presenting
resources 2. Many portals are selective and provide
information novices with a manageable plateful.
Librarians, on the other hand, have no problem dealing
Received on 15 July 2008

with information overload, and want the most complete
set of links possible on every library-related topic or
subtopic3. An attempt has been made to analyse the
library web portals of the Indian Institutes of Technology
(IITs) libraries. These Portals are different in information
content, library services, collection, etc.

2. NEED FOR THE STUDY
Indian Institutes of Technology are premier
institutions in higher education and research oriented
activities in technology in India. Libraries play an
important role in supporting their activities by performing
various functions and providing different services. Further,
as IIT’s are located at different cities of India, it is not
possible for the people residing in other places to get
information from IIT libraries.

3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The study aims to determine the information content
on the library web portals of IIT’s in India for better
accessibility. The specific objectives are:
57

(i)

To know about the organisation of library information
in web portals

(ii) To identify, whether the library web portals provide
links to other web resources of interest to the
librarians and users all over the world
(iii) To determine, whether the library web portals makes
provision for searching information including web
OPAC and feedback form
(iv) To determine the library services offered through
library web portals
(v)

To suggest the information content of library web
portals in an academic environment

4. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The study starts with the literature search from the
Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA) and
collection of the different full-text articles that are
published about library web portals. Further, the different
library web portals of the IITs were analysed with their
content, organisation of the information, links to their
information resources, services provided, etc.

5.

ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY DATA

5.1 Basic Information about the IITs Libraries
The library portal of any institution has to provide
basic information regarding the library news, library hours,
staff, organisation, floor plan, IT infrastructure, etc. Table
1 shows the information content of the portals about the
libraries of different IITs.

From the Table 1 it is clear that the library portals of
the IITs provided information about the library, which
comprises the history of the library and their contribution
to the respective IITs. It is noted that only IIT of Delhi,
Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras and Roorkee
provided information about the news and events of the
library and IITs. While four portals, namely, IIT libraries of
Delhi, Kanpur, Madras and Roorkee have shown their
working hours, the library portals of IIT Bombay,
Guwahati, Kharagpur and Madras have provided
information regarding library staff, designation, sections
and their contact details. Library organisation and floor
plan have been depicted in the library portals of IIT
Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras.
The library portals of IIT Bombay and Kanpur only
show information about the IT infrastructure of the library.
Library brochure in Printed Document Format (pdf) has
been provided by the library portals of IIT, Bombay Delhi.
Membership details of the library have been disclosed by
all the library portals of IITs except IIT Kanpur. The library
portals of IIT Kanpur and Madras have provided links to
contact the authorities of the library for any information.
Frequently Asked Questions with clarifications have been
provided by the library portals of IIT Delhi and Bombay
only. It is worth to note that none of the library portals
covered under the study provided information about travel
to library and IIT.
From the Table 1, it is observed that while the library
portals of IIT, Madras and Bombay provided more basic
information about their libraries, the library portals of IIT,
Guwahati and Roorkee provided less basic information
about their libraries.

Table 3 depicts that the library portals of IIT Kanpur
and Madras have information about their book collection
in the main part of the portal. Audio-visual collections
have been listed by the library portals of IIT Bombay, Delhi
and Madras. The collection of the CDs and DVDs has
been disclosed by the library portals of IIT Kanpur and
Madras. New arrivals to the libraries have been listed by
the library portals of the IIT Delhi and Madras. Majority of
the portals have not given much emphasis to the listing of
their collection and online services.

5.2 Organisation of the IITs Libraries
Basically library organisation consists of different
sections such as Acquisition, Technical Processing,
Maintenance, Digital Library, Virtual Library, Video
Library, Circulation, etc. Portal of any library should
provide information about their respective sections with
details of staff, functions of the sections of the library,
work, etc. The library portals of the IITs provided their
organisational information as given in Table 2.
Table 2 shows that only the library portals of the IIT
Kharagpur and Madras provide information about the
Acquisition Section and Technical Processing. Only one
portal, IIT Madras, provides information about Book
Maintenance and Video Library. Further, the library portal
of IIT Kanpur provides information about Digital Library,
and that of IIT Kharagpur provides information about
Virtual Library. The library portals of IIT Kharagpur and
Madras provide information about Circulation section of
the library. It is worth to note that none of the library
portals provide information about Back Volumes section
of their libraries, separately.

5.4 Information on Periodicals, Databases and
Electronic Resources
To be effective, the library portals must include
electronic resources including electronic books,
databases, journals, links to consortium like INDEST,
back volumes of the journals, etc., because the users
may access these resources online in Intranet and
through Internet. Table 4 shows the information provided
about the periodicals, databases and electronic
resources with their links for online access.
Table 4 depicts that the library portals of IIT Delhi,
Guwahati and Kharagpur provided information and links to
the current journals subscribed by them. The library
portals of IIT Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur and Kharagpur have
included link to the back volumes of the journals in their
libraries. Electronic journals are subscribed by all of the
IIT libraries. The links to these electronic journals have
been provided by the IIT Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati,
Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras. All the IIT libraries are

5.3 Collections of IITs Libraries
Library collection forms an important part in library.
Hence it is necessary that every library portal must
include information regarding their collection including
different kinds of materials such as books, audio-visual
materials, CDs, DVDs and listing of new arrivals in the
library. Table 3 shows the information about the collection
of the libraries of IITs as disclosed in their portals.

the members of the Indian National Digital Library in
Engineering Science & Technology (INDEST) Consortium
of the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).
But only the library portals of the IIT Bombay, Delhi,
Kanpur and Madras have online link to access the
INDEST Consortium. Further, it was observed that the IIT
Kanpur subscribed journals from J-Gate India and also
provided online link to access these journals in its library
portal. Most of the IIT libraries have subscribed the
electronic databases, but only the library portals of IIT
Bombay, Guwahati, and Madras provided links to access
these databases. The library portals of the IIT Bombay
and Madras have information and link to access the
electronic books online. Library portal of IIT Madras has
also provided information and links to the electronic
theses and dissertations online. It is worth to note that the
library portal of IIT, Roorkee has not provided any
information and links to these electronic resources.

5.5 Information Search
Any library portal must contain the Search box, so as
to search the resources of the library at a limited time.
Search box is a short cut to view and search the
resources of the library and information from external web
sources. Table 5 contains information about searching
options of the various resources located in the IIT libraries
and the web.
Table 5 shows that the library portals of IIT Bombay,
Kanpur and Madras have searching options for the theses
and dissertations. The library portals of IIT Guwahati and
Kanpur have information and access to fee (payment)based online databases. The library portal of IIT Guwahati
provides option to search free web databases. There is
option to search information from the free open archives
and electronic resources in the library portals of the IIT
Bombay, Guwahati, and Madras. The catalogue of the
libraries is accessible online through Web OPAC. The

library portals of IIT Bombay, Guwahati, Kanpur, and
Kharagpur have links to search their Web OPAC. The
library portals of IIT Guwahati and IIT Madras are provided
search option by using search engine. For searching
techno-portals and faculty publications of the IIT, only the
library portal of IIT Delhi has provided the link.

5.6 Library Services
The library plays an important role in providing
information by ways of different services. The services
include circulation, CD-ROM search, xerox, book bank,
reference, SDI, CAS, inter-ibrary loan, etc. The IITs are
engaged in technological and industrial research and their
library portals must disclose their achievements so that
the concerned industrial users can access and get the
services online. Table 6 shows various kinds of services,
which are available online, through the library portal. They
are stated as under:
As disclosed in their library portals, library
membership details have been provided by the IIT
Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati, Kharagpur, and Madras.
Circulation details have been specified only in the library
portals of IIT Bombay and Guwahati. Access to CD-ROM
has been provided by the library portals of IIT Guwahati
and Kanpur. The reprography and xerox service have
been specified by the library portals of IIT Bombay and
Delhi. Book bank facility is stated only in the library
portals of IIT Bombay and Delhi. Link to reference service
has been provided in the library portals of IIT Bombay,
Delhi, Kanpur, and Madras. As depicted in Table 6, interLibrary loan service has been provided by IIT Bombay and
Delhi. The electronic document supply service has been
provided by the libraries of IIT Kharagpur and Madras.
Access to the digital library services is stated in the
library portals of IIT Kanpur and Kharagpur. It is noted that
only the library portals of IIT Kharagpur and Madras have
services of virtual library. As stated in Table 6, IIT Madras

and Roorkee are providing services to industrial users. IIT
libraries are providing varied kinds of services, but there is
a need to provide all the services to different kinds of users
by all the IITs through their library co-operation.

5.7 Special Collection of the IITs Libraries
The Indian Institutes of Technology are premier
institutions engaged in providing higher education as well
as R&D simultaneously. To serve their purpose, the library
of IITs need to acquire and maintain varied types and
forms of collection and the collection must be accessible
online through their library portals. Table 7 depicts the
information on special collection of the IITs libraries.
Table 7 shows that the special collections of the IIT
libraries include standards, patents, IIT projects,
children’s collections, and video collections. Of which,
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

-

the library portals of IIT Delhi, Kharagpur, Madras, and
Roorkee are providing the information about accessibility
of the standards and patents. Library portals of IIT Delhi
and Kharagpur have provided link to access their projects.
Recently, IIT Madras has included the collection for
children and portal included the link and information.
Information about video collection of the library has been
shown in the library portals of the IIT Bombay, Delhi, and
Kharagpur.

7. DISCUSSIONS
The study revealed that the library portals of IITs
provided detailed information with links and menus to
access information from different information resources.
Portals also contain basic information such as
information about the library and news and events of the
library. About 57.14 per cent of the library portals are

providing information about library hours and library staff.
Whereas about 71.42 per cent provided information about
library organisation, floor plan and details of membership
of their libraries. Only 28.75 per cent of the library portals
stated about IT infrastructure, library brochure, user lists,
contact details and frequently asked questions. It is
surprising that none of the portals covered under the study
have given travel information in their portals.
The study revealed that only 28.75 per cent of the
library portals provided information about acquisition
section, technical processing and circulation section, and
only 14.28 per cent about to book maintenance, digital
library, virtual library, video library and back volumes
section.
Majority of the library portals covered under the study
provided statistical information about book collection,
audio-visual materials, CDs, DVDs, and new arrivals. But
only a few provided links to these collections. About
42.86 per cent of the library portals covered under the
study provided links to access audio-visual materials and
28.75 per cent of the library portals provided links to book
collection, CDs/DVDs and new arrivals. But majority of
these links were accessible only through Intranet of the
particular IIT and for the members of the library only.
The study revealed that about 85.71 per cent of the
library portals covered under the study provided access to
links electronic journals subscribed by the library, about
57.14 per cent of the portals provided links to access to
back volumes of electronic journals and links to INDEST
consortium, only 42.86 per cent of the library portals
provided access to electronic books and only one portal
constituting 14.28 per cent provided access to electronic
theses and dissertations. But most of theses resources
are accessible only through intranet of the respective IITs
and for the library members only.
Of the library portals covered under the study, only 57
per cent are providing access to their OPAC online, about
42.86 per cent are providing search access to theses and
dissertations, open archives and free electronic
resources, only 28.75 per cent portals are providing
search access to fee-based online databases and search

62

engines and only 14.28 per cent portals are providing
access to search free web databases, techno-portals,
and faculty publications. It is interesting to note that none
of the portals covered under the study are providing
access to local network databases.
Services play an important role in measuring the
performance of the library. Invention and application of the
library networks increased the importance of library and
information services. The library portals will be more
effective, if the different services provided by the libraries
are clearly stated. Among the library portals covered
under the study, about 71.43 per cent of the portals
provided the information about library membership and
also privileges to the library members. About 57.14 per
cent of the library portals provide reference service.
Information about other services such as circulation, CDROM search, digital library services, virtual library
services and services to the industrial users are stated
only in 28.75 per cent of library portals covered under the
study.
It is worth to note that all the IIT libraries have special
collections comprising of patents, standards and projects
and only a few libraries have children collections and
video. The study revealed that 57.14 per cent of the IIT
library portals covered the information about the
standards and patents, about 42.86 per cent provided
information about video library, 28.75 per cent about IIT
projects and only 14.28 per cent of the library portals
provided information about children collection.
The library portal of Indian Institutes of Technology
Madras provided detailed information by providing many
menus links and on other hand, the library portal of IIT
Roorkee provide lesser information compared to other
portals.

8. CONCLUSION
It is observed from the present study that all the
library portals of Indian Institutes of Technology are
different from one another in many respects. IITs are
identified as premier institutes of higher education and
research in Technology in India. Having common goal,

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

there is need for library cooperation among the libraries of
the IITs. To achieve this kind of cooperation, there is need
to design and develop a unique type of library portals
containing resources and services of their individual
libraries and also providing links libraries of other IITs.
Further, there is also need to form an educational network
specialised among the IIT libraries. At present most of the
IIT libraries are ERNET members, but ERNET include
many member libraries.
It was noted that a few library portals such as the
library portal of IIT, Roorkee, are not providing detailed
information about the library. There is necessity that
these portals must display detailed information, so as to
know about the collection and services of these libraries
online.
The effective library portal must be concise in the
sense; users do not like to scroll the screen of the portal.
There is need to provide more and more links to
secondary pages, which provide detailed information
about the sections and services of the library. It was
observed from the library portals of IITs that a few are
providing basic information about the collection, services,
special collection, library hours etc in the main page. But
there is necessary to include the information in the library
brochure, rather than main page of the portal.
Most of the library users want information regardless
of where they find it. They don’t want to limit themselves

to their library’s collection. A portal offers them one-stop
shopping that takes them from the initial need for
information through its delivery without having to use
several different tools. If well designed, a portal also
provides effective navigation of complex, multiple
collections. As library portals reflect the mirror of its
image, existing guidelines and standards should be
considered. Further, there is need to include only limited
graphics so as to load the web page through network at
least possible time.
