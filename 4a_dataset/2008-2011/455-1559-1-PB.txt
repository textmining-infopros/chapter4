1. INTRODUCTION

2. LITERATURE REVIEW

The rapid advancement of information and
communication technology (ICT) has brought a
revolutionary change in the information scenario giving
rise to a number of options to handle varied information
sources conveniently and effortlessly as a result of which
e-resources have become the most sought after modern
library’s reserves in satisfying varied needs of students,
teachers, and researchers with minimum risk and time.1
Information technology has changed the world and has
become one of the important tools for retrieving
information. The electronic information resources have
acquired a major portion of library collections. The value
and use of information resources, particularly eresources, have increased with the time. Therefore, there
is necessity to make study on the different aspects of eresources and the issues relating to the use of
e-resources by users, more particularly by the faculty
members of academic institutions.

Several studies on use of e-resources have been
carried out by students, research scholars, and teachers
of various institutions all over the world. Swain and Panda
in their study, ‘Use of e-services by faculty members of
business schools in a state of India: A study’, have
discussed on quantitative and qualitative use of eresources by the faculty members of business schools of
Orissa.1 Maunissamy and Swaroop Rani in their study,
‘Evaluation of usage and usability of electronic journals’,
have identified the usage and usability of e-journals by the
users of the NIT, Tiruchirapalli.2

The present study is an attempt to analyse the use of
e-resources by the faculty members of C.V. Raman
College of Engineering (CVRCE) and to find out the
problems and constraints faced by the users in accessing
the e-resources with some purposeful suggestions for its
development.

Appleton in his study, perceptions on electronic
library resources in further education, has expressed
personal experiences on the use of e-resources and their
impact on teaching and learning activity.3 Nikam and
Pramodini in their study, ‘use of e-journals and databases
(subscribed by UGC-Infonet consortium) by the University
of Mysore: A survey’ have analysed the utilisation of eresources and the satisfaction levels of users of Mysore

understanding and clarity. Certain factors like whether the
data collected are correct or incorrect, statistically true or
not, etc. judged using some statistical methods.

3. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
The Central Library of CVRCE, Bhubaneswar is
subscribing three online databases, i.e., IEL Online,
ASME, and Science Direct through INDEST-AICTE
Consortium. Library also has direct subscription of
Business Source Elite from EBSCO. The Central Library
is also the Institutional Member of DELNET, New Delhi,
and British Council Division, Kolkata, thereby has the
facilities to access their online databases. So far, no
survey has been undertaken to know the usefulness of
these e-resources to the users and use pattern of these eresources. The present study would reveal the usage and
usability of these subscribed e-resources.

4. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

6.1 Classified Data of the Respondents
Out of 120 respondents, 73 (61 per cent) respondents
were lecturers, 22 (18 per cent) Assistant Professors, 22
(17 per cent) Sr. lecturers and 5 (4 per cent) Professors.
Further 79 (65.8 per cent) were MTech./M.Phil; 31 (25.8
per cent) BTech, and 10 (8.4 per cent) PhD.
Regarding teaching experience of faculty members,
73 (60.8 per cent) were having 1-5 years; 31 (25.8 per
cent) 5-10 years; 03 (2.5 per cent) 10-15 years, 11 (9.2
per cent) 15-20 years; and 02 (1.7 per cent) 25-30 years
of teaching experience. Surprisingly, no faculty members
have teaching experience between 20-25 years. Thus, the
average years of teaching experience of faculty members
was 5.8 years.

The objectives of the study are:

6.2 Computer Knowledge of Faculty Members



To assess the contemporary use of electronic
information resources by the faculty members.



To examine the attitude of the faculty members
towards use of e-resources.



To find out the main reason(s) behind the usage of
electronic resources by them.



To identify and analyse the specific factors that
promote or hinder the use of electronic resources.



To suggest measures for improving the existing
library system and services of Central Library,
CVRCE, particularly in promoting the use of eresources by the faculty members.

Knowledge on computer has become bare necessity
for all profession. Realising this, the present study
attempted to ascertain the knowledge of computers of
faculty members. This study show that all the
respondents were computer literate, which is a healthy
sign for any organisation. Also, the study attempted to
know about the extent of computer knowledge of faculty
members Table1.

5. METHODOLOGY
This study is based on survey (questionnaire)
method. A structured questionnaire was designed to
collect data from the faculty members of CVRCE,
Bhubaneswar, keeping in mind the basic objectives of the
study. The data was personally collected from the faculty
members. Besides, personal interviews were also
conducted with library and information science
professionals to assess the problems relating to use of eresources by the faculty members.

6. ANALYSIS OF DATA
Out of 150 faculty members of CVRCE, only 120 (80
per cent) responded with the filled in questionnaire. The
questionnaires were edited where necessary. Thus in all
the cases the total number of respondents was 120. The
data collected through the questionnaires was
scrutinised, classified, and tabulated for better

The analysis of Table 1 shows that as high as 54
respondents, representing 45 per cent of total
respondents had ‘excellent’ computer knowledge. Further
the computer knowledge of 46 respondents (38.3 per
cent) was ‘good’, followed by 17 respondents (14.2 per
cent) with ‘fair’ computer knowledge, and three
respondents (2.5 per cent) with ‘satisfactory’ computer
knowledge. The results show an encouraging picture of
the faculty members of CVRCE on extent of computer
knowledge.

6.3 Use of Internet
Internet has become an important tool for teaching
and research. Literature on all the fields of knowledge is
available on Internet, which is very useful for faculty
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(4)

members to enrich their knowledge. The present study
attempted to find information on the use of Internet,
frequency, purpose and place of Internet use. Regarding
frequency of Internet use by the respondents, Table 2
clearly reveals that most of the faculty member, i.e., 91
out of 120 (75.8 per cent) were using Internet on daily
basis. Further, 8.3 per cent respondents were using it on
weekly basis, 2.5 per cent were using it on monthly basis,
and 13.4 per cent use it when they require it.

Central Library has not attracted faculty members to use
Internet in Library since 12.4 per cent respondents were
using the use of Internet at cyber café.

6.4 Use of e-Resources
Electronic resources along with print resources have
become an integral part of a library collection. Also, a
remarkable shift of choice from print resources to eresources have taken place by users for information.
Accordingly, a large number of e-resources are being
acquired by libraries. But it is a fact that use of eresources is not satisfactory in most of the libraries, the
main reason is the lack of awareness among the users.
The present study attempts to highlight on this matter in
the Tables 5-7.
Table 5. Awareness on e-resource

Internet use has both advantages and disadvantages.
It depends upon the purpose of use. If it is properly used,
it helps to increase knowledge and keeps oneself abreast
of the latest developments. Regarding the purpose of
Internet use, the analysis of Table 3 shows that as high as
106 responses out of 193 (55 per cent) opined that the
Internet was for study and research. It is followed by 72
responses (37.3 per cent) for e-mail/chating, and 15
responses (7.7 per cent) for entertainment.

Internet can be used in different places according to
the convenience of the user and availability of access
facility. Table 4 shows as high as 98 responses, out of 202
(48.5 per cent), indicates that respondents used Internet
in their respective departments, followed by its useat
home (48.5 per cent), at cyber café (12.4 per cent), and at
Central Library (7.9 per cent).

Table 5 clearly indicates that out of 120 respondents,
117 (98 per cent) were aware of e-resources and only
three (2 per cent) were not aware of this. The result
implies towards a positive sign regarding use of
e-resources by the faculty members of CVRCE.
The analysis of data in Table 6 shows that edatabases and e-journals were the most used eresources by the respondents as seen from their
responses which are 65 (28.4 per cent) and 64 (27.9 per
cent), respectively. It is followed by use of e-books (17.1
per cent), e-theses/dissertations (10.5 per cent), enewsgroups/magazines (8.7 per cent), and e-article/eprints (5.2 per cent). Further 2.2 per cent responses
indicates the use of all mentioned e-resources by the
respondents.
The main purpose of using e-resources by the faculty
members of CVRCE is teaching (Table 7). It shows that
as high as 82 responses, out of 205 representing 40 per

is for writing papers. Interestingly 27 responses
representing 13.2 per cent of total responses indicate
that the respondents use e-resources for all the above
mentioned purposes.

6.5 Knowledge of Copyright/IPR Issues
Copyright and Intellectual Property Right (IPR) are
two core legal issues related to any arbitrary and
indiscriminate use of any documents. Faculty members
should have the knowledge of these while using the eresources. Realising its importance, the present study
collected data on these (Table 8).
Analysis of Table 8 reveals that a majority of
92 respondents (77 per cent) had knowledge regarding
the copyright and IPR issues whereas 28 respondents
(23 per cent) did not had any knowledge regarding the
copyright and IPR issues which is quite surprising.

6.7 Reasons for Dissatisfaction on available eResources
The study investigates about the reason of
dissatisfaction on available e-resources by the faculty
member (Table 10).
Table 10 shows that the main reason of
dissatisfaction on available e-resource as opined by
respondents was non-availability of e-resources as per
the need (50 per cent). It was followed by other reasons
such as infrastructure is not good (27.5 per cent), library
time is not suitable (17.5 per cent), library staff was not
cooperative (5 per cent).

6.8 Sources of Information on e-Resources

6.6 Criteria for Selecting and Using eResource
There are various criteria for evaluation of e-resources
on the basis of which users prefer to use these eresources. Also, users depend on these factors while
using e-resources. Table 9 shows the various aspects on
which faculty member of CVRCE depends, while
selecting and using e-resources.
Table 9 shows that as high as 70 responses out of 158
(44.3 per cent) depends on reliability criteria while
selecting and using e-resources. It was followed by
usability (15.4 per cent), currency, authenticity (13.9 per
cent) and other criteria (1.3 per cent).
14

Criteria

The study attempted to know about the source from
which faculty members were getting information on
available e-resources at the Central Library. Their opinions
have been tabulated in Table 11.
Analysis of Table 11 reveals that library staff was the
main source of information for faculty member as 32.5
per cent responses indicates. It was followed by other
sources such as library notice board/circular (27.9 per
cent), office circular and college website (19.8 per cent
each). It implies that the Central Library was playing key
role in informing faculty member about the e-resources.

6.9 Usefulness of e-Resources
Table 12 shows the opinions of faculty members on
the usefulness of e-resources. Table 12 indicates that a
majority of respondents, i.e., 69 out of 120 (58 per cent)
were of the opinion that e-resources are more useful

than print resources to a great extent, followed by
51 respondents (42.5 per cent) to a small extent and
surprisingly none on ‘not at all’. It indicates that eresources were being used frequently by the faculty
members. Table also reveals the multiple opinions
regarding the advantages of accessing these resources.
Maximum respondents were of the opinion that the main
advantage of accessing e-resources was least time in
searching (18.9 per cent). It was followed by
simultaneous usage (17.5 per cent), downloading facility
(17.3 per cent), easy accessibility (16.3 per cent),
availability of journals before its print publication (14.2 per
cent), facility to contact with the authors (9.7 per cent),
and archival facility (6.1 per cent).

6.10 Search Strategy of e-Resources
Access to e-resources and finding of relevant
information/papers/articles or required e-journals/
periodicals from databases is a difficult task. It requires
skill and experience on the part of users. Hence the study
tried to collect data on the search strategy of the faculty
members and whether they needed any orientation/
training programme for this (Table 13). It shows that most
of the respondents search their required e-resources
through Google/other search engine as indicated by 105
responses (37.2 per cent). It was followed by ‘as per the
instruction of the library staff’ (32.7 per cent) and from
the ‘website of concerned e-resource’ (30.1 per cent).

Besides e-journals and e-database, e-books and
other e-resources (both online and offline) should be
acquired by the Central Library.



Infrastructure facilities such as extension of LAN
connection with all departments, procurement of CD
mirror server, etc. should be developed .



The speed of Internet needs to be increased for quick
access to the available e-resources.



The LIS professionals of the Central Library have to
create more awareness on e-resources. In this
context the website of library, newsletter of the
institution should highlight the available e-resources
at the library regularly.



The Central Library needs to arrange various
orientation and training programmes for faculty
members for the optimum use of available eresources. In this context, the Central Library may
arrange orientation programmes, subscribe database.
Also, product trials of various e-resources for specific
user groups need to be introduced.

8. CONCLUSION



Study on the use and usability of e-resources by the
faculty members needs to be made on regular basis.

The library environment has currently undergone
drastic change in terms of collections and services. The
proliferation of e-resources has had a significant impact
on the way the academic community uses, stores, and
preserves information. The advantages of e-resources
have drawn attention of the library users to a great extent.
Accordingly, these resources have occupied a
significant place in the collection and budget of almost all
libraries. Faculty members’ attitudes seem to be very
positive towards e-resources for their study and
research and the role of libraries as gateway to provide
assistance in accessing these resources.



Higher speeds Wi-Fi campus needs to be developed
by CVRCE, so that faculty members can use online
e-resources and Internet within the campus
according to their suitability.

Faculty members are heavily dependent on eresources for their required information and to keep
themselves up-to-date in their subject area. Though some
expects that the role of libraries as a gateway to the e-

resources will have less importance in future as faculty
members access more and more e-resources in their
respective departments or personal desktop/laptop, it
seems to be more hypothetical. Rather the role of libraries
in the age of e-resources will increase tremendously,
particularly in providing training and guidance to use
authentic and relevant information. The libraries are and
will develop necessary tools to provide such services to
their users satisfactorily. The study reveals that the
faculty members of CVRCE, Bhubaneswar, are using the
available e-resources satisfactorily. At the same time the
Central Library of CVRCE is playing an important role in
promotion, assistance and guidance in accessing the eresources. Still there is enough scope for Central Library
to develop its infrastructural facilities for accessing eresources, procurement of more e-resources as per
requirement, motivating users for assessing open source
e-resources, etc.
