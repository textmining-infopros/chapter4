ABSTRACT
The present study attempts to highlight quantitatively the growth and development of world literature on
nuclear waste management in terms of publication output as per international nuclear information system (INIS)
database. During 1970-2009, a total of 44529 publications were published by the scientists in the field of
nuclear waste management. The average number of publications published per year was 1113. The highest
number of publications (2795) were published in 2001. The spurt in the literature output was reported during
19912007. There were 140 countries involved in research in this field. The USA topped the list with 6672
(14.98 %) publications followed by Japan with 2859 (6.42 %) publications and France with 2612 (5.87 %).
Authorship and collaboration trend was towards multi-authored as more than 56 per cent of the publications
were collaborative in nature. An intensive collaboration was found during 20002004. Maximum publications
were from the domains, nuclear fuel processing and waste management aspect with 29159 publications
followed by nuclear installations/reactors with 4188 publications and chemical analysis with 2452 publications.
Japan Atomic Energy Agency (Japan) topped the list with 677 publications followed by Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre (India) with 533 publications. The most preferred journals by the scientists were: Transactions of the
American Nuclear Society with 528 publications, Atw Internationale Zeitschrift fuer Kernenergie with 244
publications, AIP Conference Proceedings with 238 publications. English was the most predominant language
(79.56 %) used by the scientists for communication.
Keywords: Nuclear waste, nuclear waste management, radioactive waste management, scientometrics

1. INTRODUCTION
Safe nuclear waste management has been the priority
of any nuclear programme. There has been immense
activity starting from nuclear fuel cycle to safe disposal of
nuclear waste.
As on 17th December, 2010, there were over 1118
nuclear reactors all over the world, out of which 677 were
research reactors and 441 were power reactors. Out of
these 193 research reactors and 125 power reactors have
been decommissioned/shutdown. To provide these
reactors with fuel, many other nuclear facilities exist
uranium mines, ore processing plants, fuel fabrication
facilities and fuel reprocessing plants joined in a complex,
worldwide transportation network1. Radioactive waste,
arising from civilian nuclear activities as well as from
defence related nuclear weapon activities poses a
formidable problem for handling and protecting the
environment to be safe to the present and future
generations2. There are many other sources of radioactive
wastes. They are spent nuclear fuels, waste generating

of
contaminated sites, radioactive medical waste,
radioactive industrial waste, naturally occurring
radioactive material (NORM), coal also contains a small
amount of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium, and
potassium, etc., residues from oil and gas industry also
produce radioactive wastes. Radioactive waste is
classified as low-level waste, intermediate-level waste,
high-level waste and transuranic waste according to the
amount and types of radioactivity in them3.
Nuclear waste management is becoming a major
research area all over the world. Its importance is
increasing day by day as many of the nuclear research
and power reactors are being decommissioned all over
the world and the nuclear waste arising from defencerelated nuclear weapon activities and other sources which
produce nuclear/radioactive waste. If the nuclear/
radioactive waste is not treated properly, it will harm the
surrounding environment as well as life forms in the
nature. Nuclear waste requires sophisticated treatment
452

and management in order to successfully isolate it from
interacting with the biosphere. This usually necessitates
different types of treatments, followed by a long term
management strategy involving storage, disposal or
transformation of the waste into a non toxic form.
Therefore, nuclear waste management forms an important
aspect of any nuclear establishment.
Publication and citation counting techniques have
been used in the assessment of scientific activity for at
least fifty years. During the halfcentury of this activity the
main thrust of interest seems to flow along two connected
but parallel paths: the bibliometric path of publication and
citation counts as tools for the librarian, and an evaluative
path using the same tools to illuminate the mosaic of
scientific activity4. Research publications are clearly one
of the quantitative measures for the basic research activity in
a country. It must be added, however, that what excites the
common man, as well as the scientific community, are the
peaks of scientific and technological achievement, not just
the statistics on publications. There are also other kinds of
research and technology development mission-oriented,
industry-oriented, country-specific, etc., progress in these
cannot be obviously measured by counting only the number
of publications5. The bibliometric and scientometric
techniques used to study various quantitative and qualitative
aspects of scientific endeavors have been studied6-7.
Many scientometric studies focussed on the
performance of nuclear science and technology8-20.
Scientometric studies are useful in ascertaining which
methods have been most employed for various analytical
determinations as well as predicting which methods will
continue to be used in the immediate future and which
appear to be loosing favour with the analytical community.

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data was collected from the International nuclear
information system (INIS) (19702009) database brought
out by International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna. The
INIS is the worlds leading information system on the
peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology.
Records pertaining to nuclear waste management
research were downloaded using the suitable search
strategy (nuclear waste* management* OR radioactive
waste* management*). A total of 44529 records were
downloaded for the period 19702009 and analysed as
per objectives of the study.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Geographical Distribution of Research
Output
There were as many as 140 countries actively involved
in the nuclear waste management research and produced
44529 publications. Figure 1 gives top 15 countries
actively pursuing research in nuclear waste management
which contributed more than 54 per cent of publications in
this field.
USA topped the list with 6672 (14.98 %) publications,
followed by Japan with 2859 (6.42 %), France with 2612
(5.87 %), Germany with 1819 (4.08 %), UK with 1710
(3.84 %), and the Russian Federation with 1523 (3.42 %)
publications. Table 1 gives the publication share of top 15
countries in different ten year blocks.

4.2 Annual Growth of Publications on Nuclear
Waste Management
During 19702009, a total of 44529 publications were
published on nuclear waste management by various
countries. The average number of publications produced
per year was 1113.23. The highest numbers of
publications (2795) were published in 2001. Figure 2 gives
the year-wise growth of publications in nuclear waste
management. It can be clearly visualised from the figure
that growth of the literature was very slow before 1990 and
peaked during 1999-2007. The productivity was low in
2008 and 2009 mainly due to the input time lag in the
database. Kademani21, et al. have estimated that about
70 % of total publications published during the particular
year are input in 12 months period and remaining 30 %
publications are spread over 2-3 years or more as the
database has a open provision for input of records
irrespective of their year of publication. This limitation may
be taken into account while considering the publication
productivity in 2008 and 2009.

4.3 Domain-wise Distribution of Publications
All the publications on nuclear waste management
were classified into nine (9) major domains as per the INIS

4.4 Authorship and Collaboration Patterns
Distribution of publications and authorship patterns
during five year blocks in nuclear waste management
research is given in Fig. 3. Publication trend was towards
collaborative publications. Multi-authored publications (25 authors) accounted for 48.56 per cent followed by single
authored publications with 31.86 per cent followed by
Mega authored publications (6 and above authors) with
8.32 per cent. There were 5013 (11.26 %) publications
with no authors in the byline.
Research is becoming more and more collaborative in
recent years when compared to earlier years as all the
governments are giving a lot of impetus to R&D activities.
Also it is because of the interdisciplinary nature of
subjects and the scientific methods used in research
where different subject experts are needed.
