ABSTRACT
The study explores the students perception of fines charged by libraries for overdue books, etc., borrowing
privileges, and lending periods in an Indian academic library. The study seeks to discover the extent to which
borrowers are satisfied towards borrowing privileges, lending periods, and fine amount. The study also seeks
to examine to what extent fines are perceived by the borrowers to be a deterrent to overdue library materials,
how borrowers feel when asked to pay fine, whether the fines should be scrapped in future or not, and
whether or not the level of fine is sufficiently high to compel the users to return the library materials on time.
The research method for this study was the survey method using a questionnaire to collect data. The findings
of the study reveal that majority of the borrowers are satisfied with the borrowing privileges, lending periods,
and the fine amounts. The majority of the respondents feel that library fines encourage users to return the
borrowed items on time. Most of the students favoured discontinuation of fines in future, besides consulting
them about the amount to be fixed as fine. Majority of students prefer keeping books beyond due date and
paying fine later. No significant differences were found between genders and faculties (Science, Commerce,
Management) wrt their perception of library fines. The recommendations can help libraries to devise policies
regarding library fines.
Keywords: Academic libraries, borrowing privileges, lending period, overdue charges

1. INTRODUCTION
The imposition of fines in academic libraries for
overdue items is a global phenomenon and penalties for
overdue materials have been levied by libraries for
centuries1. Besides fines, librarians have resorted to
short-term, charitable, and legalistic means to resolve the
mounting problems associated with overdues. In their
quest to retrieve overdue materials the librarians confront
delinquent borrowers by sending staff to their residence,
filing criminal charges or claims in small courts, engaging
credit collection agencies, sending overdue notices,
conducting fine free amnesty days for return of all
overdue materials, and offering rewards for returning
books2. Librarians have long assumed that imposing a fine
on borrowers who keep books out for more than their
prescribed period will prompt those borrowers to bring the
books back on time. Bringing books back on time is a
concept central to library functions-a book not in active
use should be on shelf in its proper location so that
browsers, or focused users, can find3. Fine amounts can
be per day beyond the due date, especially in cases of
materials borrowed from open access collections, or can

be on an hourly basis, especially with respect to
materials from restricted loan collections, such as reserve
materials4.
From the very beginning this familiar practice has
excited comment and controversy. Fines are thought by
many to deter patrons from keeping materials too long.
However, others believe there is little persuasive evidence
that fines are more effective at minimising overdues than
are reminder notices. Further, some critics contend
charging fines is unethical especially in public or school
libraries5.
The present study endeavours to ascertain the
attitudes of student users of Islamia College of Science &
Commerce (ICSC), Srinagar (India) towards the borrowing
privileges, lending period and overdue fines, as there is no
evidence of research on the problem in India hitherto. As a
result the perception of student community towards
borrowing privileges, lending periods and overdue fines in
Indian academic libraries is not fully understood. The
research will help libraries to devise policies regarding
library fines in India and abroad. Established in 1961 by
407

the government of Jammu and Kashmir as an
autonomous educational institution of higher learning, the
ICSC has a collection of 76,861 volumes and 60 current
periodical subscriptions. As of May 2010, the library had
4930 registered student readers, comprising 3648 (74 %)
Commerce & Management faculty students, and 1282
(26 %) Science faculty students, studying for Bachelors
and Masters courses (BSc, BCom, BBA, BCA and
MBA). Of the 4930 students 3928 (79.67 %) are males
and 1002 (20.32 %) are females.
Presently the students of 1st and 2nd year (BSc and
BCom) are allowed to borrow three books at a time where
as the students of Final year (BSc and BCom), BBA and
BCA are allowed to borrow four books at a time. The MBA
students are allowed to borrow seven books at a time. The
users are allowed to retain books for a period of 15 days
and thereafter library charges Rs 0.50 per day per book
from the student borrowers. The renewals are allowed
only for those books which are not in demand.

2. RELATED LITERATURE
Withholding library materials beyond due dates by the
users is a problem faced by libraries all over the world. In
1991, Okotore6 reported that retaining library books
beyond due dates was a baffling practice among
students. Some research has been done to unveil the
reasons behind this tendency. These include
forgetfulness, and tendency to personalise library
materials7, sheer greediness or lack of consideration for
others who need these materials8, besides users not
finishing with books9.
There is surprisingly little hard evidence that can
guide policy decisions to reduce the probability of overdue
materials2. The various measures adopted in libraries for
the timely return of the materials include library notices
and overdue fines10. Many librarians claim that fines act
as deterrent and encourage borrowers to return materials
promptly and that heavy fines make more of an impact on
borrowers than minimal charges11. Ahiakwo & Obokoh7
recommend stiff fines to overcome the tendency of late
return of library materials. A survey by Barber12 found that
96.3 per cent of respondent libraries charge fine for
overdue materials in UK and a majority (94.3 %) of these
favoured carrying on with this existing fine system. In
another such survey on circulation and fine policies
among medical libraries by Lyons11, it was found that 61
per cent of the institutions surveyed collected fines for
overdue books from students, faculty or both. However,
opinions regarding the effectiveness of fines among
librarians differed. Abareh13 has considered introduction of
special fine of NGN 30 for retaining reserve books beyond
due date, besides denying the use of reserve materials for
a determined period at Abubakar Tawafa Balewa
University Library, Bauchi, Nigeria. It is found that some
408

people consider fine a price rather than a penalty14,15.
However, Seteras16 has reported that the introduction of
fines at the Norwegian School of Economics and
Business Administration reduced overdue library books in
the institution. A study by Shontz3 found that besides
fines many other factors, such as convenience of renewal
and return, conscientiousness and the time when the
user had finished the material, determine when users
return the library materials. On the other hand, the
publication of defaulters names in local newspapers
reduced overdue library books in Iowa Public Library17.
Burgin & Hansel18 found that speedy notification and
making last notice a bill for the item had some effect on
overdue returns in South Carolina Public Libraries,
however they did not found any statistically significant
effect of charging fines on overdue returns. Sending
reminders on-time significantly increased the rate of
return of library books at ICSC19.
Despite a divided opinion over the efficacy of fines on
overdue returns among the researchers, the library users
consider library fines as a deterrent to overdue library
materials. A study by Adomi4 found that 77.3 per cent of
the respondents are of the opinion that overdue fines
encourage users to return the library materials on time in
Nigerian Universitys libraries. The same sentiments are
of the student borrowers in a New Zealand academic
library. The students also favoured the continuation of the
library fines20. In another such study by Ajayi & Okunlola1
at Hezekiah Oluwasanmi library, it is found that students
perceived the increase in fines as a welcome measure,
which would make library books readily available and
accessible.
During the past few years some alternative methods
are also being experimented at various institutions to
replace the existing fine system and ensure the timely
return of overdue library materials. For instance
Southampton Solent University does not charge fines but
instead uses a penalty points system. After determined
penalty points are acquired the students are banned from
borrowing items for a specific period2. A compromise
solution is implemented at Texas A&M University
libraries, maintaining fines for some materials but using
an inconvenience motivator to prompt timely renewal or
return of regular stack materials21. The other measures
include extended loan periods22 and positive
reinforcements5.

3. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
The scope of the present study is limited to student
borrowers of ICSC library. The following objectives have
been put forth for the study:


To discover the attitude of students towards borrowing
privileges, lending periods, and library fines
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)



To discover whether or not the fines encourage/
compel the users to return the library materials on
time



To discover whether or not the level of fine is
sufficiently high to compel the users to return the
library materials on time



To ascertain whether or not attitudes towards fines
vary among male and female and Science and
Commerce & Management students.

4. METHODOLOGY
The research method for this study is the survey
method using a questionnaire to collect data. Copies of
the questionnaire were administered and returned in
months of May and June 2010. To take sample from every
category of student borrowers (science and commerce &
management, male and female, level of course, i.e., 1st
year, 2nd year, and Final year students) the following
statistical formula is used:
n=

z 2Npq
NE 2 + z 2 pq

where, z is the probability given under 95.5 per cent
reliability; N is the population or universe; E is the
sampling error; and pq is the proportion of the total
population.
The value of pq is obtained from Science v/s
Commerce & Management ratio. The 95.5 per cent
confidence level is pre-assigned and a small sampling
error (0.05) is fixed to ensure optimal sample size.

borrowing privileges. The females seem more satisfied
(79.66 %) than their male counterparts (71.11 %), so are
Science students (76.38 %) to Commerce &
Management students (71.69 %). Keeping in view the
availability of books in library, the students of 1st and 2nd
year (BSc & BCom) are allowed to borrow three books at
a time where as the students of final year (BSc and
BCom), BBA and BCA are allowed to borrow four books at
a time. The MBA students are allowed to borrow seven
books at a time. Just 17.60 per cent respondents are not
satisfied. Some of the unsatisfied borrowers have
demanded the limit to be raised to eight books in their
remarks.
Table 2 shows that 154 which is over half of the
respondents (53.47 %) feel that the lending period of 15
days is adequate, compared to 127 (44.09 %) who feel
otherwise. There is a slight variation in the attitude of male
and female users (54.11 % versus 50.87 %), and Science
and Commerce and Management (52.63 % versus
53.77 %) respondents. Shontz3 maintains that period for
which users can retain the library materials is the best
compromise between the current users convenience and
future users needs. It has been found that loan period for
monographs is usually two weeks11. Pertinently the users
are allowed to retain books for a period of 15 days at ICSC
library and the renewals are allowed only for those books
which are not in demand. The students in their remarks
have expressed the desire of 30 days loan period, and in
some cases, a full academic session. However it is not
possible for the library having limited copies of various
book titles, to extend the lending periods beyond 15 days.

The sample size of different categories is determined
by the population allocation method as:
ni= n Ni/N
where, i= 1, 2, 3, 4. n= 290 (total sample size); Ni is
total number of students in the category; and N is the total
population.
Out of the 290 students, the 231 males and 59
females were chosen; the number of science students
was 76 and that of commerce & management students
was 214. The number of 1st year students was 136; 2nd
year students was 83; final year 68; and that of MBA
students was 3. The number of BSc students was 67;
BCom - 200; BBA - 11, BCA - 9; and MBA - 3.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The results of this study are presented in Tables 1-5. It
is evident from the data (Table 1) that majority of the
respondents 207 (72.88 %) are satisfied with the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)

Of the 290 respondents (Table 1), 207 (71.37 %) are
satisfied with the amount fixed as library fine. The females
are more satisfied (79.66 %) than their male counterparts
(69.26 %). There is a great deal of difference in the
attitudes between the students of Science and
Commerce and Management faculties (55.26 % v/s
77.10 %) towards the amount of overdue fine. Presently,
the library charges Rs 0.50 per day per book from the
borrowers. An increase in overdue fines is perceived a
welcome step by students as it makes library materials
readily available and accessible1.
It is revealed from the data of Table 1 that 78.12 per
cent (225) respondents feel that overdue fines compel
users to return the borrowed books on time. The basic
purpose of enforcing the overdue fines is to encourage the
library users to return the borrowed books on time, so that
the same are issued to other users in queue. As it is not
possible for a library (particularly in the developing world)
to have a copy of the book for each user, the only way out
is to circulate the available stock to as many users as
possible. This seems to be working as a small portion of
respondents 13.88 per cent (40) are not convinced that
the overdue fines compel users to return the borrowed
materials on time. The data also reveals that there is a

little difference of opinion between males and females/
Science and Commerce & Management students
(Table 2). The finding is in accordance with the earlier
studies by Adomi4 and Anderson20 who found that overdue
fines encourage users to return the borrowed items on
time.
It is interesting to note that 60.56 per cent (172)
respondents prefer to keep important books beyond due
date and pay fine later (with a little gender and faculty
variation), as it is found that fine is considered by some
people a price rather than a penalty14,15.The overdue fine of
Rs 0.50 per day per book is a meager amount. It seems
that some of the students who can afford, willingly pay the
fine and keep the books beyond due date, as many
librarians claim that heavy fines make more of an impact
on borrowers than minimal charges11. However most of the
respondents who prefer to keep the books beyond due
date and fine pay later belonged to lowest annual income
group of < Rs 1 Lakh (70.34 %). This may be due to the
fact that students of high family income may buy the
books and therefore there is no need for them to check
410

out the book from the library and no way to retain the
librarys book beyond due date. The remaining
respondents belonged to these income groups (1-2 Lakh
14.53 %; 2-3 Lakh 3.48 %; 3-5 Lakh 6.39 %; >5 Lakh
5.23 %).
It is noteworthy that more of female respondents
(55.93 %) to male (46.69 %) feel bad when asked to pay
fine. On the whole 48.60 % respondents feel bad when
asked to pay fine, compared to 46.85 per cent who feel
otherwise (Table 1). It is also evident from the data that
there is a great deal of difference of opinion between
Science and Commerce & Management faculty
respondents (61.84 % v/s 43.80 %) (Table 2). Different
aspects of fines have been a matter of investigation for
psychologists, as it is being referred to as a century long
experiment in behavioural psychology by Caywood23.
Table 1 shows that 63.06 per cent (181) respondents
are of the view that library fines assist libraries in
generating funds for the libraries, compared to 18.81
per cent (54) who number of respondents who feel that

library fines should be scrapped is 125 (44.32 %) than
those who feel that it think otherwise, and an equally
18.11 per cent (52) are silent on the issue. There is
however difference of opinion on the basis of gender and
faculty. The male respondents who think that overdue
fines assist libraries in generating the funds is 65.50 per
cent compared to 53.44 per cent females. Table 2 shows
the 66.50 per cent Commerce & Management students
and only 53.33 per cent of Science students think in the
same terms. The revenue generated through overdue fine
is a meager amount and is not regarded as a source of
income by most of the libraries, but as a deterrent to
delinquent users to return the borrowed materials on time,
although some consider it a source of income4. The
amount generated at ICSC library through overdue fines is
approximately Rs 37,000.00 annually which is deposited
in the library local fund to meet some minor expenses.
The number of respondents who feel that library fines
should be scrapped is 125 (44.32 %) than those who feel
that it should be continued 88 (31.20 %). There is a

remarkable gender difference in the opinion of those who
feel that it should be scrapped (48.43 % males v/s
28.81 % females). However, a good number of
respondents 69 (24.46 %) are silent on the issue. This is
in contrast to study by Anderson20, who found that users
favour the continuation of the library fines. It may not be
proper to discard overdue fine as it will encourage users to
retain the books beyond due dates, as agreed by the
users that it compels them to return books on time. It is
due to this reason that an overwhelming majority of
libraries still charge fine for overdue materials and also
favour carrying on with this existing fine system12.
About 77.33 per cent (215) respondents are aware of the
fact that overdue fines are a disciplinary measure intended
against library defaulters as against 9.71 per cent (27) who
believe it is not. There is a little difference of opinion on the
issue between males and females (78.26 % versus 73.68%)
and a great deal of difference between Science, and
Commerce & Management students (65.78 % versus
81.68%). The main purpose of enforcing fines for overdue

materials in libraries is disciplinary and it is quite
encouraging that majority of the students are aware of this
fact.

It is evident from the data, 59.16 per cent (171)

An overwhelming majority of respondents 76.89 per
cent (223) are of the opinion that amount to defaulters
should be reduced when the overdue is very high, out of
which 79.22 per cent (183) are males and 67.79 per cent
(56) are females. More of the Science students 86.84 per
cent to Commerce & Management 73.36 per cent support
the argument. This may be due that fact that Science
students need more books than their counterparts for
their assignments and consequent overdue of
books.16.55 per cent (48) respondents do not think that
the amount to defaulters should be reduced.

Faculty

It has been found that often the students ask library
staff at ICSC to reduce the amount citing various reasons
like holidays, strikes, ill health, etc. However, the
circulation staff can not reduce the amount as it is beyond
their control.
One can note that respondents who would like that
the amount charged as fine should be the same no matter
when one returns the overdue material is 64.93 per cent
(187) compared to 27.08 per cent (78) who would like it to
be otherwise. There is a slight variation of opinion on the
issue so for as males and females are concerned
(65.93 % versus 61.01 %), Science and Commerce &
Management users (68.425 versus 63.67 %). Going by
the students, if such a practice is adopted, it will be very
difficult for the library to retrieve the borrowed items on
time as delinquent users would know that they will not
have to pay more than a fixed amount.
An overwhelming majority of respondents across the
board (with slight gender and faculty variations) 82.06 per
cent (238) believe that the students should be consulted
about the amount that should be fixed as library fine. This
is much higher (47.9 %) than reported by Adomi4. Only
14.13 per cent (41) respondents feel that the students
should not be consulted on the issue.
The t-test static were carried out to find out any
significant difference by gender and faculty with respect to
students perception of library fines at 0.05 level of
significance. As is evident from Table 3, no significant
differences were found between male and female students
as the observed t of 1.02 is lower than the critical value of
1.96. Similarly, no significant difference were found
between the Commerce & Management and Science
students, as the observed value of 1.28 is less than the
critical value of 1.96. However, a mean difference of 1.53 is
observed between the two faculties (Table 4 and Table 5).

6. CONCLUSIONS
The basic purpose of introducing library fines is to
encourage the borrowers to return the library materials on
time. While a majority of users agree that fines compel
them to return the borrowed library materials on time, the
amount of fine is not high enough to serve as an effective
deterrent to overdue library materials. Keeping in view the
findings of the study, the following recommendations are
put forward:


The amount of fine should be raised to the extent to
which it serves as an effective deterrent to overdue
library materials. Besides the amount of fine should
be periodically reviewed.



Besides fines, the suspension of borrowing privileges
should be introduced to ensure the timely return of
library materials.



The users should be informed about the purpose of
fines, besides informing them about renewals,
borrowing rights, and lending periods.

7. FUTURE RESEARCH
As the faculty and staff are not liable to pay fines for
overdue library materials at ICSC library, their perception
of library fines need to be ascertained to identify
differences in attitudes among various user groups.
Besides, it could be explored from the borrowers as to
what they think will be more effective deterrent to library
overdues than fines.
