1. INTRODUCTION
The scholarly journals have suffered very high inflation
in cost for the past several decades. The situation in India
is compounded with continuous decline in the value of
Rupee against major foreign currencies that resulted in
steep decline in procurement of scientific journals by
Indian libraries causing a very wide gap in journals that are
required and those that are actually available in the
libraries. All educational institutions in India, especially
the universities, face acute shortage of funds to subscribe
to international scholarly journals.
It is estimated that a typical university in India
subscribes to less than two hundred international
journals. Moreover, some of the Indian universities do not
subscribe to any international journals at all. While there
are around 50,000 scholarly journals, all research
institutions and universities in India put together had
combined subscriptions to only around 1,500 journals in
print till recently. Many smaller colleges and institutions
subscribe to fewer than hundred journals. Most colleges,
including those imparting postgraduate and doctoral
programmes, do not have financial resources to subscribe
to any international journals; their subscription list
includes few Indian journals and a few popular magazines.
Received on 30 December 2009

However, the accessibility to international journals in
Indian universities and technical institutions has improved
many-fold with setting up of a few government-funded
library consortia. Prior to setting up of these consortia,
the access to e-journals was restricted to premier
institutions like IISc, IITs, IIMs and a few central
universities who were subscribing to a few e-resources
including bibliographic databases on CD-ROM, a few ejournals accessible free with subscription to their print
versions, and a negligible fraction of e-journals on
subscription.
After launch of the Indian National Digital Library in
Engineering Sciences and Technology (INDEST)
Consortium in 2003 and UGC-INFONET Digital Library
Consortium in 2004, availability and accessibility of eresources increased phenomenally in centrally-funded
technical institutions (IITs, IISc, IIMs, IIITs, etc.) and
universities, setting in a new culture of electronic access
and browsing in academic institutions. Besides, INDESTAICTE Consortium and UGC-INFONET Digital Library
Consortium, a number of other library consortia have
emerged in India in the past five to six years. These
include Council of Scientific and Industrial Research
(CSIR) E-journals Consortium, Department of Atomic
Energy (DAE) Consortium, FORSA Consortium, Indian

new IITs, IISERs, IIMs, and IIITs (centrally-funded) qualify
for inclusion as core members of the Consortium.

This article describes major functions, activities and
services of the INDEST-AICTE Consortium. It briefly
touches upon resources subscribed, terms of licenses,
policies and practices for archival backups, membership
programmes including core members, AICTE-supported
institutions and self-supported category of membership,
etc. The article outlines governing structure of consortium
and their roles. It elaborates on strategies used for
effective implementation of consortia amongst member
institutions. The article briefly touches upon the
economics of the INDEST-AICTE Consortium. Lastly,
article elaborates on future endeavours of the INDESTAICTE Consortium.

2.2 Present Status

2. INDEST-AICTE CONSORTIUM: GENESIS
AND PRESENT STATUS
2.1 The Genesis
The proposal for consortia-based subscription to
electronic resources was first discussed at length at the
National Seminar on Knowledge Networking in
Engineering and Technology Education and Research
held at IIT Delhi during 1-2 December 2000. On the
recommendations of one of the work groups of this
Seminar, a preliminary proposal on consortia-based
subscription to electronic resources was prepared and
circulated to all IITs, IISc, and RECs (now NITs). On the
basis of feedback obtained from these institutions, a
revised draft proposal was prepared which encompassed
other engineering colleges and institutions also as
beneficiary of this initiative. The Ministry of Human
Resource Development (MHRD), based on the last draft
proposal, appointed an expert group in April 2002 for
Consortia-based Subscription to Electronic Resources for
Technical Education System in India under the
chairmanship of Prof. N. Balakrishnan from IISc, to
discuss elaborately on the e-resources with the
publishers and aggregators and evolve a working model
for execution of the Consortium.
The expert group submitted its report in September
20021, and consequently INDEST Consortium was set-up
in 2003 by the MHRD. Thirty-eight centrally-funded
government institutions including IITs, IISc, NITs, IIMs,
IIITs, and few other institutions are core members of the
Consortium. The Ministry provides funds required for
accessing e-resources to the core members through the
Consortium Headquarters (HQ) situated at IIT Delhi. All
80

The INDEST Consortium was re-named as INDESTAICTE Consortium in December 2005 as AICTE took the
lead to spread the access to e-resources to all its
affiliated institutions.

The INDEST-AICTE Consortium is the most ambitious
initiative taken so far in the country. The benefits of
consortia-based subscription to electronic resources are
not confined to centrally-funded technological institutions
in the country only but are also extended to all
educational institutions under its open-ended proposition.
Sixty government/government-aided engineering colleges
are being provided access to selected electronic
resources with financial support from the AICTE. More
than 820 engineering colleges and institutions have
already joined the Consortium under its Self-Supported
category. The Consortium is also a member of
International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC).
The total number of members in the Consortium has
grown to 928. The Consortium, on the basis of sheer
strength of number of institutions, has attracted the best
possible prices and terms of agreement from the
publishers, and currently facilitates access to eresources to more than a million students. It subscribes
to over 12,000 e-journals and six bibliographic databases
from a number of publishers and aggregators. The
INDEST website hosts a search and browse interface to
locate these journals and their URLs.

3. GOVERNANCE
The Consortium operates through its HQ under the
National Steering Committee consisting of Director, IIT
Delhi as its ex-officio Chairman and Chairman, AICTE as
its Co-chairman. Members from amongst the beneficiary
institutions include two representatives each from IITs and
NITs; one representative each from IISc, IIITs and IIM;
representatives from self-supported institutions; Director
(Technical Education), MHRD; and Adviser (PC), AICTE.
The Committee is responsible for taking major policy
decisions as well as their execution. In addition, a
National Review Committee, under the Chairmanship of
Joint/Additional Secretary (Technical Education), meets
annually with an overall responsibility for making policies,
monitoring the progress, and coordinating with UGC and
AICTE for promoting the activities of the Consortium.
Further, a National Advisory Committee, constituted by
the Joint Secretary (Technical Education), comprises
representatives from amongst member institutions;
Financial Adviser, MHRD; National Coordinator, INDESTAICTE Consortium; and representatives from the AICTE
and UGC. The National Coordinator for the Consortium is
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

appointed by the Technical Bureau of MHRD and is
responsible for all the operations of the Consortium. The
National Coordinator is also the Member Secretary of the
National Steering Committee.

subscription to e-resources to 60 government/
government-aided engineering colleges. These include 37
engineering and technology colleges and 23 universities
having engineering departments/faculty. All 60 institutions
offer postgraduate courses in engineering and technology,
etc. Institutions supported by the AICTE are given
differential access to only one to four e-resources, i.e.,
IEL Online, ASME Online Journals, ASCE Online
Journals, and ProQuest Science depending on courses
offered by these at postgraduate level.

4. MEMBERSHIP
The INDEST-AICTE Consortium has three categories
of members, namely, core members, AICTE-supported
institutions, and self-supported institutions. Number of
members in the Consortium has increased from 115 in
2003 to 928 in 2009.

4.3 Self-supported Engineering Colleges and
Institutions

4.1 Core Members

The Consortium, being an open-ended proposition,
also invited UGC-affiliated institutions to join hands and
share the benefits it offers in terms of lower subscription
rates and better terms of agreement with the publishers.
Eight hundred and twenty institutions including
engineering and technological colleges, management
colleges, pharmacy colleges, and government
autonomous institutions have joined the Consortium
under its self-supported category. The number of
institutions under self-supported category has increased
from 17 in 2003 to 820 in 2009. Growth in number of
members in different categories of Consortium from 2003
to 2009 is given in Table 1. The INDEST website maintains
a searchable database of its members and resources
accessible to them with a browse interface to facilitate
browsing of institutions by categories of members and
state-wise list of institutions.

All centrally-funded government technical institutions
including IITs, IISc, NITs, IIITs, IIMs and few other
institutions are core members of the Consortium since its
inception. The MHRD provides funds required for
differential access to electronic resources for its core
members through the Consortium HQ. Seven new/
additional centrally-funded technical institutions, namely,
NIFFT Ranchi; NIT Patna; IIIT Jabalpur; and three National
Institutes of Technical Teachers’ Training and Research
(NITTTR) in Chandigarh, Bhopal, and Kolkata were also
included as core members in 2008. The Consortium is in
the process of inducting additional centrally-funded
technical institutions including five Indian Institutes of
Science Education and Research (IISER) and six new IITs
as its core members. Core members of the Consortium
have grown from 37 in 2003 to 48 in 2009.
Core members are grouped in four groups to extend
differential access to e-resources to them, based on their
resource requirements and specialisations. Group I
comprises eight institutions including IITs and IISc; Group
II comprises 21 institutions including NITs, Indian School
of Mines (ISM), Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering
and Technology (SLIET), and North East Regional
Institute of Science and Technology (NERIST); Group III
comprises 14 institutions including IIMs, IIITs, NITTTRs,
National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE); and
Group IV comprises five Indian Institutes of Science
Education and Research (IISER).

5. RESOURCE SHARING
The Consortium subscribes to 14 full-text eresources, five factual/statistical databases, and 6
bibliographic databases from 24 publishers including
scholarly societies, commercial publishers, and
aggregators. While full-text resources subscribed by the
Consortium contain full-text of electronic journals,
conference proceedings, standards and protocols,
chapters of books, etc., the bibliographic databases
contain abstract of articles published in journals,
conference proceedings or chapters in books along with
links to the full-text e-resources. The few factual/
statistical databases, subscribed for business and
management schools, contain factual/statistical data
including analytical and financial reports on industries and
companies. Details of resources subscribed and

accessible to the core members of the Consortium are
given in Table 2.

±

Print-independent Subscription: Subscription to
e-resources is print-independent in most of the cases
except Elsevier’s ScienceDirect, Springer and
Emerald Xtra. As such, beneficiary universities are
free to drop subscription to print copy of journals
accessible to them through the Consortium.

±

Inter-library Loan (ILL): Licensee is allowed to
fulfill ILL requests from non-authorised users using
printed copy of article downloaded from the licensor’s
website.

±

Usage Statistics: Publisher is required to submit
COUNTER compliant usage/statistics on number of
downloads (both full text and abstracts) in a given
month, previous month, and cumulative for one year.

±

Inclusion of additional Titles: The publisher is
required to provide access to new journal titles that
are added during the contract period at no additional
cost.

±

Electronic Link: The licensee may provide
electronic links to the licensed materials from
licensee’s web page, either at journal-level or at
article-level and publisher would provide help in doing
so.

±

Protection on Increase of Price: Publisher would
provide protection on increase in price of subscribed
resources. The increase should not be more than
5 per cent.

Access to electronic resources is IP-enabled for all
the members except for institutions that do not have
static IP addresses.

6. LICENSE AGREEMENT AND FAIR USE
Copyright is manifested in terms of licenses in digital
environment. The Consortium is required to sign license
agreement with the publisher on behalf of its member
institutions. The terms of licenses for digital collection
vary in terms of conditions, variety of pricing models and
access limitations. While the Consortium signs the
license agreement prepared by the publisher, care is
taken to incorporate terms and conditions mentioned
below for as many publishers as possible2.
±

±

82

Simultaneous Users: There is no limit on number of
simultaneous users for most of the resources
subscribed by the Consortium, except for IEL Online,
Web of Science, and SciFinder Scholar. Any number
of users can access e-resources including e-journals
and bibliographic databases at any given time except
for the three resources mentioned above.
Walk-in Users: Walk-in users who are physically
present at the subscribing institutions are allowed to
use the resources.

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

±

±

Perpetual Access and Archival Rights: In case of
termination of the agreement or on the expiry of the
agreement, publisher would extend perpetual access
to e-resources for the paid period of subscription
along with their back files offered during the
subscription period. Alternatively, the publisher would
provide full text of e-resources with back volumes (ejournals/e-databases) for each year on prevalent
formats, i.e. CD-ROM/DVD-ROM with the retrieval
software for access on the network. In case of
change in archival technology, the state-of-art
archival technology shall be made available by the
licensor to subscribers at no extra cost for archival of
full-text data of e-journals to higher version of
technology.

7. USAGE ANALYSIS
Most publishers maintain detailed usage statistics
compliant to an international standard called COUNTER
for resources offered by them to the Consortium.
Comparative usage statistics for member institutions is
obtained from the publishers and is made accessible to
the member institutions through the INDEST website.
Institutions with low usage are requested to optimise their
usage. A custom-made web interface called e-RAMS
(Electronic Resource Access Management System) has
especially been designed to provide and deliver statistics
of usage to member institutions. Besides, publishers also
provide User ID and Password to the member institutions
for accessing usage statistics of their resources directly
from publisher’s website3. The analysis of usage
statistics of e-resources by member institutions reveals
consistent increase in usage for all e-resources from
2003 to 2008 as elaborated below.

Awareness and Training: The publisher or its
representative would conduct Users Awareness
Programme on campuses of member universities at
no charge to the universities. The publisher would
provide publicity material, brochures, posters and
user-support material in both prints as well as on CD
form.

±

E-print Archive: Member universities would be
allowed to download bibliographic records, abstracts
and full-text articles published by their faculty,
researchers, students, and staff from publisher’s site
and import them in their local database and
Institution Repositories.

±

Arbitration: All disputes arising under the
agreement shall be settled under the rules of the
international arbitration court by one or more
arbitrators in accordance with the said rules. The
place of the arbitration shall be in India and carried
out in the English language.

7.1 Increase in Usage of e-Resources by
different Categories of Core Members
Table 3 depicts increase in usage of various resources
by different categories of core institutions from 2003 to
2008. The data reflects consistent increase in usage from
2003 to 2008 for all resources by all categories of
institutions amongst the core members. The increase in
usage for IIMs was calculated from 2004 to 2008 since
most of the management resources were added in
2004.
Tables 4-7 depict that while there is an appreciable
increase in usage of all full-text e-resources, the usage of
bibliographic databases have decreased substantially

with exception to SciFinder Scholar. The decrease in
usage of bibliographic databases is global phenomenon.
Most of the management resources have registered
appreciable increase in usage except in case of ABI
Inform where there is a slight decrease in usage for 2008.
As mentioned before, most bibliographic databases
have registered appreciable increase in usage from 2003
to 2005. After 2006, the usage of bibliographic databases
has come down significantly except in case of SciFinder
Scholar that has registered significant increase in all the
years.

7.2. Increase in Usage of e-Resources by
AICTE-supported Institutions
The AICTE institutions have also registered a
significant increase in usage of e-resources subscribed
for them in terms of number of research articles
downloaded from 2003 to 2008. The comparative
decrease in usage of ASCE and ASME is attributed to the
failure of scitation platform, which resulted in missing
usage statistics for a number of institutions for certain
duration. Table 8 depicts increase in usage of e-resources
by AICTE-supported institutions.

7.3. Increase in Usage of e-Resources
Subscribed by the Self-supported
Institutions
Increase in number of downloads in case of selfsupported institutions has not been analysed because

self-supported members had joined the Consortium over
the years. However, Table 9 provides number of
subscribers for each e-resource. It may be noted that IEL
Online is the most favourite resource amongst selfsupported category of institutions with 428 subscribers
followed by ASME Journals with 174, ScienceDirect with
136, and Springer with 97 subscribers in 2009.

8. ECONOMICS OF INDEST-AICTE
CONSORTIUM
The factors that determine economic viability and
cost-effectiveness of consortia-based subscription are: its
membership, intensity of usage, successful migration
from print to electronic version (with discontinuation of
print) and cost avoidance. These factors are discussed
below in detail4.

8.1 Number of Members
A consortium is more meaningful and effective if it has
larger number of members. The collective strength of
members of the consortium provides it the power to
bargain with the publishers for better rates of subscription
and terms of licenses. The cost of subscription to eresources comes down as more and more institutions join
the consortium. The INDEST-AICTE Consortium took the
benefit of large number of subscribers for IEL Online,
ASCE and ACM Digital Library as mentioned below:

2006

ASCE Online: The cost of subscription decreased
by 8.33 per cent in the year 2003, i.e. from US $ 3600
to US $ 3300 when its subscriber base increased
from 28 to more than 36.

Subscription cost for both the above mentioned
resources came down drastically in the same year as
more number of members joined the Consortium.
±

ACM Digital Library: The cost of subscription
decreased by 3.51 per cent in 2003-2004, i.e. from
US $ 4560.25 in 2003 to US $ 4400 in 2004 when its
subscriber base increased from 28 to more than 40.

±

Considering the increase in number of subscribers,
several publishers agreed to peg their 2004
subscription rates at 2003 level without annual
increase in rates.

8.2 Cost Avoidance
The Consortium, with its collective strength of
participating institutions, has attracted highly discounted
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

rates of subscription coupled with most favourable terms
of agreement. In effect, the members of the Consortium
avoid the cost commitments on the following:

8.2.1 Lower Rates of Subscription
The rates offered to the Consortium are lower by 50
per cent to 98 per cent depending upon the category of
institution. The Consortium was offered lower rates of
subscription from the vendors not only because of
combined strength of its members but also due to the
eagerness of publishers to enter the Indian market. Cost
avoidance on account of lower rates of subscription for the
members of the Consortium is calculated in terms of
difference between cost paid by the Consortium for
member institutions for e-resources and cost payable by
individual institutions in case the resources were
subscribed by them on their own.
Figure 1 depicts that there is a notional saving of Rs
643 crore considering the fact that the same resources on
list price would have cost Rs 692 crore as against Rs
24.42 crore paid by the INDEST-AICTE Consortium for
2009 for its core members.

8.2.2 Annual Increase in Rates of Subscription

8.3 Intensity of Usage: Cost Recovery

Members of the Consortium have the benefit of cap on
the annual increase in the rates of subscription. While the
usual increase in price of e-resources vary from 10 per
cent to 15 per cent, members of the Consortium enjoy the
cap on increase in price ranging from 4.5 per cent to 8 per
cent.

The recovery of cost incurred on e-resources
subscribed through the Consortium can be judged in
terms of intensity of usage of resources. Most publishers
maintain detailed usage statistics for resources offered by
them to the consortium. The INDEST-AICTE Consortium
obtains comparative usage statistics for member
institutions from the publishers and sent to the member
institutions regularly with a request to optimise the usage
and check misuse, if any.

8.2.3 Cap on Annual Increase on Print
Subscription
Several publishers also extend the benefit of cap on
the annual increase in the rates of subscription of eresources on print resources. While the usual increase in
price of e-resources vary from 10 per cent to 15 per cent,
members of the Consortium enjoy the cap on increase in
price ranging from 5 per cent to 6 per cent.

8.2.4 Lower Rates for Print Subscription
The publishers of e-resources offer lower rates of
subscription for print publications to the member of the
Consortium in lieu of their subscription to the electronic
version. For example, subscriber to IEL Online (5 and 15
simultaneous users), ASCE, and ASME Journals Online,
can avail subscription rates for the print version of these
resources. The discounted print subscription rates for
these resources are given in Table 10.

The cost recovery is calculated on the presumption
that if the e-resources were not available through the
Consortium, articles downloaded from these resources by
the member institutions would have been sourced on ILL/
document delivery at a cost of US $ 15 per article (average
cost of article taken from a study conducted by the
American Research Libraries. The cost recovery table is
led by Group I institutions (IITs and IISc) with Rs 1697.57
crores as cost of articles downloaded by them as against
Rs 27.87 crores spent on subscription to e-resources
recording a gain of Rs 1685.85 crores in terms of cost of
research articles downloaded in excess. Group II
institutions (NITs, SLIET, ISM and NERIST) were second
on the cost recovery table with Rs 117.64 crores and Rs
7.83 crores as the cost of articles downloaded and cost of
subscription to e-resources, respectively with Rs 109.80

usage varies from one category to another. The cost
recovered in case of AICTE supported institutions is

Consortium, i.e. articles worth Rs 53.06 crore were
downloaded in excess.

8.3.1 Average Cost of an Article/Record
The average cost of a full-text article or a bibliographic
record varies from Rs 0.46 in case of IIMs to Rs 43.94 in
case of NITs as depicted in Table 11. In case of IITs/IISc,
average cost of article is as low as Rs 10.84. The trend
clearly shows that bibliographic databases are less costeffective since full-text databases are preferred over
bibliographic databases and are used more extensively in
comparison to bibliographic databases.

8.4 Migration from Print to Electronics:
Cost Savings on Account of Drop in
Print Subscriptions
The INDEST-AICTE Consortium, as a policy, has
asked their core member institutions to decrease their
print resources gradually. It was, however, observed that
several e-resources are linked to their print subscriptions
and the core member institutions are not at a liberty to

Average cost of articles for
different categories of core
members

delete their print subscriptions that are linked to
electronic access. The member institutions were,
however, suggested to cancel their print subscription in
preference to electronic accesses, wherever possible.
The member institutions of the Consortium have recorded
a saving of Rs 16.39 crores on account of deletion of print
subscription to resources being subscribed by the
Consortium. This savings assume special significance
considering the following facts:
(i)

Total amount spent on subscription to e-resources for
these 48 institutions was Rs 31.39 crores during
2008–2009;

(ii) The Consortium subscribes to more than 12,000 ejournals and six bibliographic databases. As such the
access to e-resources to all 48 institutions has
increased significantly from almost negligible; and
(iii) All the institutions do not get access to all the
resources subscribed by the Consortium, however,

an interface called JCCC facilitates access to all
journals at the content level to all core members of
the Consortium. The JCCC offers an environment to a
user wherein he/she may request one of the libraries
in Consortium for a full-text article which is not
accessible at his/her institution.
Figure 3 depicts comparison between cost savings vs
total expenditure on e-resources. It may be noted that
access to full-text resources in most of the institutions
has been raised from negligible to more than 12,000
journals and six bibliographic databases.

9. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES
ADOPTED BY THE INDEST-AICTE
CONSORTIUM
Considering the fact that funds required for
subscription to e-resources for most of the institution are
met by the Government, it is inevitable to take steps to
ensure utilization of resources in all member institutions.
Some of the important steps taken in this direction are as
follows:

9.1 Promoting Use of Resources
The Consortium needs to take steps to promote
usage of subscribed resources amongst the member
institutions. It maintains a comprehensive website and a
template web page for all member institutions. Besides,
training programmes and annual meets, both at institute
level and consortium level, posters, brochures and user
manuals were prepared and distributed amongst member
institutions. Soft copies of these tutorials have also been
made available through the INDEST website. The website
88

also provides links to web-based tutorials available for
these resources5.

9.2 Usage Monitoring
Most publishers maintain detailed usage statistics for
resources offered by them to the Consortium.
Comparative usage statistics for member institutions is
obtained from the publishers and sent to the member
institutions regularly with a request to optimise the usage
and check misuse, if any. A custom-made web interface
called
e-RAMS
(Electronic
Resource Access
Management System) was especially designed to provide
and deliver statistics of usage to member institutions. The
usage statistics for several resources are accessible to
the institutions through web-based interfaces from the
publisher’s site.

9.3 INDEST-AICTE Consortium Users’ Group
at each Institution
With an aim to optimise usage of e-resources made
available through the Consortium, each member
institution is required to constitute an INDEST
Consortium Users Group Committee, which may be a
Sub-committee of the existing Library Committee. The
INDEST Consortium Users Groups are required to meet
once in a month to review the usage and other problems.

9.4 INDEST Consortium Users’ Convention at
each Institution
It is obligatory for each institution to organise a Users’
Convention in their respective institutions for e-resources
accessible to them through the INDEST Consortium for
the benefit of their user community.
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

9.7 Reliability of Connectivity

(20); ISM, Dhanbad; SLIET; and NERIST fall under
Category II institutions; and IIIT (Allahabad), and IIITM
(Gwalior) are considered as Category III institutions. IIMs
are considered as a category in themselves, and NITIE
and IIITM (Gwalior) are also included with IIMs for purpose
of providing e-resources to them. The category of
institutions are basically used to denote the level of usage
of e-resources, conceived to be highest amongst
institutions in Category I, modest in Category II and
lowest amongst the Category III. Further, usage of eresources requires ICT infrastructure. While all Category I
institutions have well-developed ICT infrastructure, most
Category II and III institutions have at least modest ICT
infrastructure. The rates of subscription, number of
simultaneous users and number of resources offered to
various categories of institutions are worked out based on
their usage/suitability to the respective categories of
institutions.

Availability of adequate Internet connectivity and
bandwidth are crucial for optimal use of e-resources.
Steps are being taken at the institutional level as well as
at the level of Ministry to increase bandwidth and
connectivity available to each centrally-funded technical
institution.

The Consortium is considering categorisation of
institutions based on intensity of usage of e-resources
instead of their status. Based on higher usage of a given
resource, the IITs may be considered Category I
institutions whereas IIM may be considered Category II
institution for the same resource based on its low usage6.

9.8 Benchmarking Outcomes

9.10 Training of Users

Providing access to e-resources to the faculty and
researchers is not a purpose in itself. It is only a means to
trigger a stronger research and academic culture in the
institutions recipient of this benefit. Science Citation
Index (SCI) is considered to be a filtering mechanism that
indexes qualitative research output based on citations
received by it. The SCI can also be searched to find out
qualitative productivity on institutions. The source articles
appeared in SCI for all INDEST members in 2003 can
serve as a yardstick to measure current research output
of these institutions. The research output in 2003 can
then be compared with their research output in 2009 to
measure the impact of e-resources provided through the
INDEST-AICTE Consortium on the research productivity
of beneficiary institutions over a period of five years.

The web-based search and browse interfaces allow a
user to conduct his/her own search without the help of an
intermediator, i.e. a librarian or an information specialist.
However, it is important that users are trained in the art of
searching so that they can conduct better search that
provide better results and save their time. Training
programmes are a crucial requirement that a consortium
has to fulfil to facilitate optimum use of subscribed eresources. Training programmes act as a bridge to
facilitate better communication amongst members of
Consortium and find answers to common problems. Such
programmes make users competent to conduct their own
searches more effectively. Proper training would make
library staff more competent enabling them to provide
qualitative services. “On the job” training programmes are
preferable not only because they benefit large number of
users but also solve localised technological problems that
can be solved by the experts available at the time of
imparting training.

9.5 Regional Coordinators
The Consortium has provision to appoint regional
committees and regional coordinators to promote
subscription to e-resources through the INDEST
Consortium amongst educational institutions.

9.6 Copyright and IPRs Issue
Users as well as librarians are sensitised on issues of
licenses and agreements that consortium signs with the
publishers. Users are informed about “does” and “don’ts”
in electronic environment. While most of the publishers
allow ILL, electronic delivery of articles are not allowed.
The Consortium website provides detailed information
about license agreements signed with the publishers on
behalf of member institutions.

However, the number of publications in SCI cannot be
considered as sole criteria for measuring productivity of
institutions. Other criteria that may also be considered
include: patents, research projects, research reports,
honours and awards, etc.

9.9 Categorisation of Institutions based on
Usage
Member institutions of the INDEST-AICTE Consortium
are categorised based on the recommendation made by
the Task Force on Human Resource Development in
Information Technology. As such, eight institutions (all IITs
and IISc) are considered as Category I institutions, NITs
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

Imparting training to members of the INDEST-AICTE
Consortium is a decentralised activity. All IITs, NITs and
IIMs may conduct training programmes in their respective
regions with financial support from the Consortium.
Moreover, all member institutions of Consortium are also
required to conduct training programmes in their
respective institutions for the benefit of their users. The
Consortium has signed a tripartite agreement with the
publishers of e-resources with a local vendor as third party
responsible for providing training on resources at
89

campuses of various member institutions. All institutions
have been requested to take benefit of this arrangement
and organise training programmes on various resources
within their institutions.

9.11 Archival Access/Back-up
Unlike in print media, the electronic access is made
available for the period of subscription. The electronic
access gets terminated as soon as the subscription
period is over even for the period for which subscription
was paid. Most publishers have made offers for archival
back-up or access to e-resources if Consortium decides
to discontinue subscription to their resources. The offers
made by the publishers fall under the following categories:
(i)

Perpetual Access to Resources for Subscribed
Period: Publishers like Elsevier Science and
Springer have a policy to provide perpetual access to
their subscribed resources for the period of
subscription.

(ii) Back-up CD-ROM made available during
Subscription Period: Backup on CD-ROM is being
supplied along with its web-based access for
resources like ABI/Inform Complete, ProQuest’s
Science and EBSCO Business Premier.
(iii) Back-up Data (raw) to be supplied on CD-ROM
on Termination on Subscription: Several
publishers, like EI Village and Springer Verlag, have
agreed to provide their data on CD-ROM on
discontinuation of service.
(iv) Local Hosting of Electronic Resources: ACM
Digital Library has set up a local server that would
host entire contents of ACM Digital Library using
search and browse platform used by I Group.
More recently, all publishers have been requested to
provide full-text data on CD/DVD in a standardised format
on completion of every year with the search and browse
capabilities in-built. They are also expected to help us
install these CDs/DVDs on our servers so that the data
could be used instantaneously as the need arises.

10. FUTURE ENDEAVOURS
The INDEST-AICTE Consortium plans to take up
activities that may not be associated either with the
purchase of e-resources or their usage but with
completely different activities that require collaborative
efforts and Consortium with its infrastructure can act as a
catalyst. The Consortium would take up additional
activities related to content creation7. Some of the
important activities that Consortium has initiated include:
±

90

Setting-up interoperable electronic submission of
theses and dissertations.

±

Setting-up of interoperable institutional repositories
in member institutions.

±

Web-based Union Catalogue of Journals and other
serial publications.

±

Web-based Union Catalogue of Books.

±

Cooperative Cataloguing of Internet-based eresources.

Besides, cross-subscription to e-resources with
UGC-INFONET Digital Library Consortium is proposed
with financial support from the MHRD, i.e. subscription to
INDEST-AICTE resources for universities and UGCINFONET resources for technical institutions as well as
for subscription to UGC-INFONET e-resources for
colleges. The project proposal, jointly submitted by the
two Consortia to the Ministry has been sanctioned.

11. CONCLUSION
The INDEST-AICTE Consortium, with its collective
strength of participating member institutions, has
attracted highly discounted rates of subscription coupled
with most favourable terms of agreement. Consortium
was offered very attractive prices from the vendors not
only because of combined strength of its members, but
also due to the eagerness of publishers to enter the Indian
market. The rates offered to the Consortium are lower by
50 per cent to 90 per cent depending upon the category of
institution. Moreover, the rates have come down further
with initiatives taken by the AICTE.
Consortium has triggered remarkable increase in
sharing of both print and electronic resources amongst
participating library through its website and through JGATE Custom Contents for Consortia (JCCC) being
subscribed for all core members of the Consortium. The
INDEST-AICTE Consortium, being an open-ended
initiative invites other institutions to join it for the benefits it
offers. The consortium thrives on the strength of members
it has. With increase in number of participating members
the consortium would be able to get higher rates of
discount for various resources and better terms of
licenses. Future plans of INDEST-AICTE Consortium
include setting-up mirror servers, local hosting and to
obtain national licenses for important e-resources with
access spread out to as many educational institutions as
required.
