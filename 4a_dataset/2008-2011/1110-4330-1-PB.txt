ABSTRACT
This paper examines Online Public Access Catalogue usage by the students and faculty of Panjab
University Library, Chandigarh. OPAC, an information retrieval system, has revolutionised access to
bibliographic information through search capabilities such as keyword searching, Boolean searching,
truncation, proximity searching, and item identity number searching. A questionnaire-based survey on use of
OPAC was conducted forA.C. Joshi Library on various categories of users such as faculty members, research
scholars and postgraduate students, covering different disciplines such as basic sciences, applied sciences,
social sciences, and humanities. The paper discusses various aspects of OPAC such as frequency of use,
purpose, ease of use, satisfaction level, etc. An attempt is also made to explore the reasons for the least used
search options of OPAC. The results of the study reveal that a significant number of users search information
regarding the library material through OPAC despite encountering problems. Lack of basic skills among users
was found to be the major reason for not utilising full features of OPAC. It is suggested that University library
should organise quality instruction programmes to improve knowledge and skills of the users.
Keywords: Catalogue, information retrieval, library automation, OPAC, user study, university library

1. INTRODUCTION
A large number of libraries in India have automated
their operations and services using this technology to
fulfil their users' needs. Public catalogue, which is an
important service of the library is not exceptional to
computer technology. Computerised catalogue is termed
as Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC). It acts as an
information retrieval system for the user. OPAC has
revolutionised access to bibliographic information through
search capabilities such as keyword searching, Boolean
searching, truncation, proximity searching, and item
identity number searching. These were not possible in the
traditional catalogue.
Today, a number of libraries are providing OPAC
service to their users to find out their documents. In such
a situation, the libraries should examine periodically how
much comfort the users feel with this service so that
some initiatives could be taken timely to improve this
facility. Therefore, a study has been undertaken on the
use of OPAC by the users in Panjab University Library,
Chandigarh.

2. A.C. JOSHI LIBRARY—A BRIEF
INTRODUCTION
The Panjab University Library is officially known as
A.C. Joshi Library after the name of the illustrious ViceChancellor of the University. The Library houses more
than 6.8 lakh volumes including books, bound volumes of
periodicals, theses/dissertations, rare books, reports,
and government documents, back files of newspapers,
other non-book material, and manuscripts. It is
subscribing approximately 662 current periodicals. This
library also possesses facilities like photocopy, Internet,
CD-ROM databases, etc. It is equipped with computer
and communication network which is connected to
campus-wide network. It has its own server to support
automation of library. It is automated with integrated
library management software named Techlib Plus. All
library operations are being operated with the help of the
computer and it is providing OPAC facility to the users. In
2003, INFLIBMENT Centre came up with a consortium
project named 'UGC-INFONET' to provide access to the
universities with electronic resources through a central
agency. The Panjab University is also a part of this

consortium from its beginning. As per the usage statistics
provided by various publishers to INFLIBNET, the Panjab
University is among the top ten universities using
electronic resources1-2.

3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The present study aimed to achieve the following
objectives:


To assess as to what extent the users are using
OPAC.



To find out the purpose of use of OPAC.



To know whether the users face problems while using
OPAC.



To study the satisfaction of users while using OPAC.

4. SCOPE OF THE STUDY

6 DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
6.1 Features of Techlib Plus OPAC
Techlib Plus is an integrated modular system for
automating functions for libraries and information centres.
It is DOS-based system and developed by Information
Dimensions Inc, Dublin, Ohio. The features available in
Techlib Plus OPAC are shown in Table 1. To present the
features of OPAC, a check list was designed on the basis
of the checklist developed by Babu and O'Brien3 but
some modifications were made in it. It covers interface,
search capabilities and facilities of the OPACs.
The evaluation of the checklist indicates that this
OPAC provides basic search options and facilities, i.e.,
simple search, expert search, Boolean search and
truncation search. It offers access points by author, title,
subject, call number, keyword, and combined search for
searching information/documents.

The present study included faculty members,
research scholars and postgraduate students of Panjab
University Library, Chandigarh. The main aim of the
study was to assess the purpose, knowledge and
frequency of using OPAC and problems faced by users.
A sample of 252 users was taken covering various
disciplines such as basic sciences, applied sciences,
social sciences and humanities.

While it does not provide search limit by year of
publication, it offers search limits by the type/form of
publications. It has provision for both short and long
bibliographic displays. Although it provides user
assistance/on-screen help to the user on its search
interface, but it lacks facilities of spell check online
tutorial and procedural prompts or guidance to indicate
next steps during a search.

5. METHODOLOGY

There is no provision for new arrivals, reservation,
renewal, patrons to see the information regarding the
books on loan, over dues, etc., and provision to indicate
the search interface separately for novice or
experienced/expert users. The facility of providing links
to electronic sources is also not available. Thus, the
features and facilities of this OPAC need to be
strengthened so as to execute the search effectively and
efficiently.

A questionnaire was designed to gather primary data
which was distributed among 252 users constituting 24
faculty members, 82 research scholars and 146
postgraduate students of A.C. Joshi Library during 20082009 session. Proper care was taken to select the
representative sample from each category proportionately
on the basis of total strength of category concerned.
A total of 190 out of 252 respondents completed and
returned the questionnaires giving overall, a response
rate of 75.5 per cent. Out of 190 respondents, 17 (8.9
per cent) faculty members, 61 (32.1 per cent) research
scholars, and 112 (58.9 per cent) postgraduate students.
Out of the responses, 60 (31.6 per cent) were received
from social sciences, followed by 53 (27.9 per cent) from
basic sciences, 43 (22.6 per cent) from applied
sciences, and 34 (17.9 per cent) responses from
humanities.
The investigator also had discussions with some
users on various issues of OPAC to make the data and
information more convincing and authentic. The
collected data was analysed by using SPSS statistical
package.

6.2 Frequency of OPAC Use
It is important to know how frequently the users use
OPAC to locate their required documents. The frequency
of using OPAC indicates its value in the library. Table 2
highlights the frequency of OPAC use. The table depicts
that out of the total 190 users very few, i.e., 3 (1.6 per
cent) were not aware of OPAC service. Only 13 (6.8 per
cent) used OPAC very frequently, almost one-third of
users used frequently, 53 (27.9 per cent) used
occasionally, 19 (10 per cent) used rarely, and 36 (18.9
per cent) never used OPAC. Table 2 further shows that
majority of users regularly (very frequently and
frequently) used OPAC and a little more than one-fourth
users moderately/occasionally used OPAC.

The users' knowledge about using OPAC is an
essential factor for searching the resources of a library
efficiently. Therefore, the opinions of the users were
collected to rate the knowledge of using OPAC. Table 5
shows that only 11 (7.3 per cent) out of 151 users were
of the views that they have excellent knowledge of OPAC,
almost one-sixth of users above average, 57 (37.7 per
cent) average, 45 (29.8 per cent) below average, and
only 12 (7.9 per cent) extremely poor knowledge. Table 5
also shows that only one-fourth of users stated that they
have adequate (excellent and above average) knowledge
of using OPAC.

6.6 Purpose of Using OPAC
Table 6 shows the purpose of using OPAC is
indicated. It depicts that 119 (78.8 per cent) users
consulted OPAC to know the availability of the required
document in the library, 47 (31.1 per cent) to know
whether the required document issued/checked out, and
103 (68.2 per cent) to know the location of the required
documents . It is clear from Table 6 that majority of users
consulted OPAC to know the availability and location of
the required documents.
Table 6. Purpose of using OPAC

6.4 Other Methods Used by the Users
The opinions regarding other methods used by the
users who never used OPAC are represented in Table 4.
Out of 36 users 23 (63.3 per cent) consulted card
catalogue to search the documents, 32 (88.8 per cent)
searched the library shelves themselves. Further, 19 (52.7
per cent) seeked the help from library staff to find out the
documents, and 22 (61.1 per cent) seeked the help from
the friends. Thus, it is clear from Table 4 that majority of
these users preferred to search shelves or consult card
catalogue to locate the required documents.

6.7 Frequency of Use of Access Points
The users come to library with various approaches to
find out the required documents. They can search the
information by author, title, subject, keyword, call/class
number, and combined search through OPAC.
Therefore, an attempt was made to know the most used
approaches. Table 7 highlights the awareness about
these access points and the frequency of their usage. It
indicates that all the users were aware of the existence of
author and title as access points in OPAC. As a result, 46
(30.5 per cent) users searched the documents by title

very frequently, one-third searched the documents by
title frequently, one-fourth search the documents by title
occasionally, only 14 (9.3 per cent) searched the
documents by title rarely.
Almost similar results were observed in case of
Author access point. Only 17 (11.2 per cent) users were
not aware of subject access point. One-fifth of the users
used subject approach regularly (very frequently and
frequently). Similarly, only 20 (13.2 per cent) used it
occasionally, almost one-fifth of the users use it rarely
and almost one-third of users used it never.
Almost three-fourth of users were aware of keyword
and a significant number of users were not aware of call/
class number and combined search. The data reveals
that a few users used keyword approach and very few
call/class number and combined search. It is clear from
the Table that author and title were the most used access
points.

6.8 Reasons for Most Used Access Points
As shown in Table 7, author and title were the most
used access points. A few users used other access
points regularly (Table 8). 'No response' in Table 8
indicates those users who do not use any of access
points frequently. The table depicts that almost one-sixth
of users responded that they have 'comparatively good
knowledge to search' the most used access points,
whereas 87 (57.6 per cent) 'comparatively easy to
search'. The data further reveals that a large majority of
users expressed that the most used access points were
'comparatively easy to search'.
Table 8. Reasons for most used access points

6.9 Problems Faced By Users in the Most
Used Access Points
Table 9 indicates problems, if any, faced by the
users in the most used access points. Notably, 60 (39.7
per cent) users faced the problems in searching the most
used access points, whereas almost one-third of users
did not faced any problem. Thus, the most used access
points were not free from the problems.

only 4 (6.6 per cent) respond 'Lack of knowledge', about
one-sixth respond 'do not know to narrow/expand search
results', 6 (10 per cent) opined 'results/output too large or
too small, very few, i.e., 2 (3.3 per cent) opined 'lack of
on-screen help' and 4 (6.6 per cent) opined 'no results/
output but book in library'. Further analysis infers that the
users are not acquainted with search strategy of OPAC
to find out the relevant information and documents.

6.11 Reasons/problems for the Least Used
Access Points
The reasons/problems for the least used access
points are presented in Table 11. One-sixth respondents
did not responded to this query. Forty four (29.1 per
cent) stated 'Do not know how to use', 35 (23.2 per cent)
'complicated/confusing to use', and 20 (13.2 per cent)
'do not know how to narrow/expand search results'. While
only 17 (11.3 per cent) express 'no output/null retrieval', 7
(4.6 per cent) 'lack of on-screen help' and very few, i.e.,
3 (2 per cent) 'lack of assistance from library staff'. The
data reveals that the responses for the first three
problems/reasons in Table 11 accounted almost two-third
of total 151 users. Thus, it can be inferred that there is
lack of basic skills among the users in searching the least
used access points.

and search strategies. In addition, the users sometimes
typed search terms in wrong fields as they applied 'title
searches' in the field/search box of 'author' and
consequently, they obtained no results. Chisman, Diller
and Walbridge6 reported that typing a search in the
wrong format led some of the users to conclude that the
item they were looking for was not in the library's
catalogue. Further, to confirm the spelling errors in
metadata, five hundred entries were browsed randomly
and no spelling errors were found there. A strong feature
of this software is that it makes index/keyword for every
word/term in database. Hence, catalogue database has
sufficient keywords for selecting search terms.

6.12 Orientation Programme Received by
Respondents
Table 12 shows the responses from the users about
attending user orientation programmes. In this
programme, the users are oriented about library facilities
and services including OPAC. The Table highlights that
majority of the users constituting 96 (63.6 per cent) were
not aware of such programmes. Almost one-fourth of 151
users attended orientation programme, whereas 20 (13.2
per cent) users did not attended while they were aware of
it. It is clear from the data that a small proportion of users
attended orientation programme. During informal
interview with the users, it was found that this programme
helped in searching OPAC. Novotny and Cahoy7 found
that library instruction could have a positive effect on
user search behaviours in using OPAC.

During the survey, it was noticed that the majority of
users were unaware that they have misspelled search
terms, while OPAC of Techlib Plus requires exact search
terms or spellings. The users rarely checked spelling
errors, which resulted in 'no output/null retrieval'. They
also faced difficulties for selecting appropriate search
terms and could not formulate good search queries.
Some previous studies have shown similar findings. Antell
and Huang4 reported that users rarely utilised correct
and complete subject terms and therefore retrieved zero
results in almost half of their searches. Morupisi and
Mooko5 discovered that the users faced common
problems in using the OPAC that included typographical
errors, spelling difficulties, appropriate search terms,

6.13 Availability of Library Staff near OPAC
Table 13 shows the responses about the availability
of library staff to assist the users for using OPAC. The
Table reveals that only 15 (9.9 per cent) users found that
library staff was always available near OPAC, almost
one-sixth found library staff usually available, 59 (39.1
per cent) found occasionally available, 34 (22.5 per cent)

of users occasionally available near OPAC.

6.14 Need of Assistance of Library Staff
Table 14 depicts the responses of the users about
the need for the assistance from the library staff near
OPAC. It depicts that 64 (42.4 per cent) out of 151 users
always needed the assistance from library staff for
searching OPAC, 43 (28.5 per cent) usually, about onesixth occasionally, 16 (10.6 per cent) rarely, and a very
few, i.e., 4 (2.6 per cent) never needed the assistance. It
is inferred that a large majority of users constituting 107
(71 per cent) needed regularly (always and usually)
assistance from library staff near OPAC. In a similar
study, Rajput8, et al. found that the dominant majority of
users opined for assistance/advisor near the OPAC.

6.17 Overall Ease of Using OPAC

Table 15 presents the opinions of respondents about
the adequacy of computers/terminals available in the
library for OPAC use. Table shows that only 15 (9.9 per
cent) users strongly agreed that the number of
computers was adequate, about half of users agreed with
availability of computers, 44 (22.5 per cent) were neutral
about it, while almost one-sixth disagreed with availability
of computers, and very few, i.e., 3 (3.3 per cent) strongly
disagreed with availability of computers. It is clear from
Table 15 that majority of users opined that the number of
computers was adequate for OPAC use.

6.15 Adequacy of Computers for OPAC Use

Adequacy of computers

data related to this query is depicted in Table 16. Among
the respondents, 22 (14.6 per cent) said very fast display
of the results after a search, 84 (55.6 per cent) said fast
display of the results, 35 (23.2 per cent) said moderately
fast display of the results, 8 (5.3 per cent) said slow
display of the results, and very few (2 representing
1.3 per cent) said very slow display of the results. It is
evident that a large majority of users (70.2 per cent) feel
that the display of the results after a search was fast
(very fast and fast). Besides this, during the survey the
researchers observed instant display of results.
Moreover, in case of large number of documents on a
search term in the catalogue database, information
retrieval took less than/or approximately one minute.

In response to the overall ease of using OPAC, only
a few users 7 (4.6 per cent) expressed that OPAC is very
easy to use, 24 (15.9 per cent) easy to use, 53 (35.1 per
cent) moderately easy to use, 54 (35.8 per cent) difficult
to use and only 13 (8.6 per cent) found OPAC very
difficult to use. Table 17 shows that majority of users (45
per cent) felt that OPAC is difficult (difficult and very
difficult) to use and some users (35.1 per cent) said
OPAC is moderately easy to use.
As discussed earlier in Section 6.10 and 6.11, the
users sometimes receive too large or small results; they
do not know properly to narrow/expand search results.
The lack of understanding of the capabilities of OPAC
also created difficulties for users. Such users are
generally unable to apply effective search strategies and
to use all search features. Apart from this, OPAC users
are also accustomed to simplicity of Web seaching.
Therefore, users felt that OPAC is complicated/confusing
to use.

Many researchers have also noted that the users
experience that OPAC is difficult to use. One of the
reasons mentioned commonly in research is that users
usually use the OPAC as they do a search engine.
Search engines and OPACs have certain similarities;
however, the system complexity of OPACs is far greater
than that of search engines9. While examining over
17,000 OPAC sessions using transaction logs, Malliari
and Kyriaki-Manessi10 discovered that individuals use
very few of the search features provided by the system.
Mulla and Chandrashekara11 investigating the libraries of
Engineering Colleges in Karnatka found that OPAC
systems were not user-friendly. The users were facing
certain difficulties in making proper use of the OPAC
facility. Moreover, information retrieval (IR) systems are
not too much simple to unserstand. OPAC as an IR
system is more complicated and requires a certain level
of expertise to use.
Borgman12 pointed out that information retrieval in
an OPAC requires conceptual knowledge of the IR
process, semantic knowledge of how to effectively
execute a query, and technical skills to implement the
query. Hence, OPAC searchers are facing difficulties for
a long time.
Further, Techlib Plus is a DOS-based system. These
types of systems are difficult to use in comparison to
Windows-based systems because users have to give a
command to operate such systems. Windows-based
systems provide various searching functionalities and
flexibilities to get the search results with little effort.

7.

On the basis of the findings, the following
suggestions have been made for optimum utilisation of
OPAC facility in the University library:


The study indicates that OPAC system is difficult to
use. The major reason of complexity of use is that
OPAC is DOS-based system. Therefore, the library
should provide Windows-based OPAC system that
has simple search options.



It is observed that the OPAC does not offer various
essential features such as spell-check software,
quick search, online reservation, online renewal, new
arrivals and book cover display facilities. Besides
these features, there is no provision for links to
electronic sources/content pages. Therefore, it is
strongly recommended that the said features must
be incorporated in OPAC. Such features may
enhance its optimum utilisation and also make it
more attractive and useful.



OPAC should have more user-friendly online help that
may provide guidance to users to start a search and
to indicate next steps during a search.



It was also felt that the system designer should
provide two separate search interfaces on OPAC
system for novice and experienced/expert users.



To facilitate the users, the University library should
organise quality instruction programmes on the use
of different techniques and strategies in retrieving
information about the documents. The instruction
programmes may enhance user knowledge and
basic skills for searching OPAC. In addition to this,
printed instruction may be provided to understand
the functions of OPAC.



It is evident from the study that the users were not
having basic skills of searching OPAC. Therefore,
they needed the assistance of library staff near
OPAC terminals for optimum utilisation of this
service.

6.18 Overall Satisfaction Level in Using OPAC
Table 18 exhibits overall satisfaction level of users in
using OPAC. It highlights that out of 151 users a very few,
i.e., 2 (1.3 per cent) were fully satisfied with OPAC use,
almost one-fourth were satisfied a little more than
andone-third moderately satisfied with OPAC use. Almost
one-third were dissatisfied with OPAC use, 11 (7.3 per
cent) were very dissatisfied with OPAC use.
Evidently, it is clear that only a small portion of users
is satisfied (fully satisfied and satisfied) with OPAC
working.

SUGGESTIONS

8. CONCLUSIONS
Users usually come to OPAC when they want to
search the required materials on the topic of their interest.
In this process, OPAC, as a retrieval tool, plays an
important role for finding out the required documents.
From the present study, it is evident that majority of users
use OPAC to know the availability and location of library
materials, and at the same time, they expressed that they
face difficulty in its use. It was found that users have not
acquired basic skills to apply effective strategies such as
309

subject, keyword, call number, and combined search
options. The major reasons for the least used search
options are 'do not know how to use', 'complicated/
confusing to use', and 'do not know how to narrow/expand
search results'. Therefore, the University library should
arrange instruction programmes on the effective
techniques and strategies of OPAC so that maximum
number of users could utilise this facility efficiently.
Further, library professionals have to ponder what
changes should be made to it. In this regard, library
professionals should convey users' problems as well as
their needs and requirements to library software
developers; they should also collaborate with the software
vendors. Finally, the system designers should design
user-friendly OPAC.
