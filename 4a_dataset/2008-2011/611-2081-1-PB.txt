ABSTRACT
Education is undoubtedly a process of living. It cherishes and inculcates morale values, disseminates
knowledge, spreads information relevant to its institutions, and keeps alive the creative and sustaining spirit.
Application of information and communication technologies in libraries and information centres has posed many
challenges to library professionals as well as LIS education. This paper briefly traces the history and
development of the LIS education in India. It also traces the emergence, trends and issues of LIS education in
north India. It describes the status, the different patterns, and levels of LIS education.
Keywords: Library and information science education, LIS education in north India, trends and issues of LIS in north
India

1. INTRODUCTION
Education is the most important investment that
governments of different countries make. Countries all
over the world today need to emphasise on building the
creative and productive capacities of their workforce.
Only academic knowledge of the students may not serve
the purpose. They need to have interpersonal skills too.
The ability of a nation to use and create knowledge as
capital determines its capacity to empower and enable
its citizens by increasing human capabilities. India today
stands poised to reap the benefits of a rapidly growing
economy and a major demographic advantage that will
see the country having the largest resource of young
people in the world in the next few decades. The
challenge and the opportunity are to galvanise our
national potential into a dynamic resource: an informed,
enlightened and capable young Indian citizenry would
not only enhance and enrich the processes of national
development, but could be a positive force in the world.
As our Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh has stated:
“The time has come to create a second wave of
institution building, and of excellence, in the fields of
education, research and capability building so that we
are better prepared for the 21st Century”1.
Government, industry, and the public have
recognised the significance of information resources as
strategic resources and intellectual capital. Information
is one of the determinants of social, economic and
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

cultural growth, therefore, an effective information
system in the country is necessary to be supported by
an efficient workforce. A need to breed librarians as
facilitators is always there and library schools have to
fulfill the responsibility of human resource development
to provide an efficient workforce to manage library and
information centres.India is an ancient civilisation with a
rich lineage of cultural heritage. It comprises 28 states
and 7 union territories. Spread over an area of
32,87,2631 sq. km, India is the seventh largest country
in the world2. On geographical bases, India has six
major zones: East India, West India, North India, South
India, North-east India, and Central India3. The States
and Union Territories in the northern region of India
includes:

2. SCOPE OF THE PAPER
The scope of this paper is limited to formal library
and information science (LIS) education programmes/
courses at the postgraduate level conducted by the
university departments, documentation and information
centres and research institutions in North India.
Facilities for LIS education in north India are available in
Union Territory of Chandigarh, Delhi (National Capital
Territory), Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and
Uttar Pradesh. At present, no postgraduate course is
available at the university level in Himachal Pradesh and
Uttrakhand. This paper does not include courses
conducted at the under-graduate level and certificate
courses by various agencies such as library associations,
teachers training institutes, polytechnics, and even
universities. Short-term specialised courses conducted
by the university departments and documentation
centres have not been included in this paper.

3. LIS EDUCATION IN INDIA
Since ancient times, India has been a centre of
excellence in the field of higher education. Today India
has one of the largest higher education systems in the
world. There are 85 universities/deemed universities/
institutions for higher education in north India3. India is
also gradually emerging as a key player in the LIS
education. LIS education is being imparted in India since
1911 when the first library school was started in Baroda,
in Maharashtra under the direct royal patronage of
Sayaji Rao Gaekwad II. In 1915, it gained the first-time
university patronage under the umbrella of Punjab
University when another American student of Dewey,
Asa Don Dickinson (1876-1960), the then librarian of
Punjab University, Lahore (now in Pakistan), started
three-month apprentice training programme for working
librarians. Before independence, there were only five
Universities (Andhra, Banaras, Bombay, Calcutta, and
Madras) offering the Diploma in Library Science. A large
number of colleges, universities, associations, and
learned
societies
started
LIS
courses
after
independence. Major stakeholders in LIS education are
universities.
After 1950s, a large number of departments were
established in universities to provide different levels of
LIS education, i.e., Diploma BLIS, MLIS, MPhil and
PhD. Masters degree in LIS is a one- or two-year long
structured programme after 10+2+3 years of education
in any discipline. Some universities have two separate
programmes like one-year BLIS degree, and one-year
MLIS degree. Some have two-year integrated MLIS
programme running into 4 semesters. At present, there
are two national institutes, namely, the Documentation
Research and Training Centre (DRTC) in Bangalore, and
NISCAIR (National Institute of Science Communication
and Information Resources), formerly Indian National
10

Scientific Documentation Centre (INSDOC), in New
Delhi, concentrating on training professionals for special,
industrial and corporate libraries and information centres
(oriented towards science and technology). As a third
wave, there are distance education courses run by the
National Open Universities started with the effort of Indira
Gandhi National Open University, which started
Bachelor’s Degree in 1989 and Master’s Degree in 1994.
State Open University like Netaji Subhas Open
University (West Bengal) and various other universities
quickly followed suit to offer a gamut of LIS courses in
the distance education mode.

4. LIS EDUCATION IN NORTH INDIA
LIS education in India is currently passing through a
turning point and has become a fast developing subject
with a multidisciplinary approach. Today, LIS education
not only includes the library-specific subject but has
extended to subjects like computer application,
statistics, information science, and management
studies. With the changing scenario, modern
librarianship has become a profession with a diversity of
opportunities and challenges for LIS students and
professionals. LIS education being offered at university
level in various states of north India, i.e., Jammu and
Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi (National Capital
Territory) Uttar Pradesh and Union Territory of
Chandigarh by the following universities/institutes:

5. LIS SCHOOLS IN NORTH INDIA
Table 1 shows the names of the universities/
institutes along with the names of their respective
departments offering LIS courses and their dates of
establishment. As seen from Table 1, the oldest
Department of Library and Information Science was
established in BHU in 1942, in the northern region of
India followed by DU. The latest department established
in the north India is BBAU. In addition, largest numbers of
LIS departments were established during 1969-1972 and
1984-1989.

Almost all the universities have their departments
named either Department of Library Science or
Department of Library and Information Science with an
exception of BU which has named it after Prof. SR
Ranganathan, and NISCAIR, which calls it Education
and Training Division.

6. HISTORY AND STATUS OF LIS EDUCATION
IN NORTH INDIA
6.1 Punjab University, Chandigarh
Punjab University was established in Lahore (now in
Pakistan) in 1882. After the partition in 1947, the
University was constrained to function for almost a
decade without having a campus of its own. In 1956, the
University was relocated at Chandigarh4.
The Department of LIS at Punjab University was
established at its Chandigarh Campus in 1960 and
started a Postgraduate Diploma in Library Science in
the same year. It was renamed as Bachelor of Library
Science (BLIS) from the academic session 1968-69 and
as Bachelor of Library and Information Science (BLIS)
from the academic session 1988-89. The University

National Open University (IGNOU) in September 1985.
IGNOU introduced its programmes in 1987 and has so
far launched 117 programmes covering more than 900
courses consisting of PhD, Master’s degree, Advanced/
Postgraduate Diploma, Diploma, and Certificate
Programmes, etc6. IGNOU is the first university, which
started quality LIS education through open mode. This
was a major step in making LIS courses available in the
areas where the professional and technology–oriented
education had not reached5. It has introduced many
innovative ways and means of providing distancelearning packages to the learners.
The LIS courses offered by IGNOU are quite popular
and have set a new trend of multimedia-based LIS
education in the country. It may be noted that LIS is one
of the programmes offered by the School of Social
Sciences in IGNOU. The University launched its BLIS in
1989. The programme was completely revised in 2000 to
keep pace with the changing dimension of the subject,
particularly in relation to the application of information
technology (IT). IGNOU started MLIS in 1994. It was
revised in July 2005. MLIS Online LIVE (Library and
Information Virtual Education) is an initiative of IGNOU to
develop in-house Learning and Content Management
System for imparting online education7.

fields of education. NISCAIR has a special name for its
two-year integrated programme, i.e., Associateship in
Information Science (AIS).
Only a few universities provide LIS education
through distance education mode. One of these is
IGNOU, which is a premier national level open university
to provide all its courses via distance learning. Few
universities such as PUCHD, KUK, and GNDU also
provide BLIS through correspondence courses. As far as
pre-research courses are concerned, not many
universities provide MPhil courses. The number of
universities providing PhD course (10) is far more than
that of MPhil (5).

8. ELIGIBILITY AND ADMISSION CRITERIA
Table 3 gives details of the eligibility conditions to
different courses offered in universities in north India. It
shows that all BLIS and MLIS courses require at least a
graduate degree for admission. While some universities
like IGNOU and AMU also settle for experience in LIS
field if the cut-off marks of the student are less than 50
per cent. Most of these give admission on the basis of
merit while some have a more rigorous criteria involving
entrance tests as in case of Kurukshetra University. In
DU admission in BLIS is given on the basis of merit
whereas for MLIS admission is through entrance test.

9. SEATS OFFERED

located in a separate building consisting of lecture hallcum-auditorium, seminar room, rooms for faculty,
computer laboratory, and a well-equipped departmental
library29.

7. COURSES OFFERED
Table 2 gives details of the different types of LIS
courses offered by various universities and institutes of
the northern region of India. Table reveals that six
universities/institutes have started a two-years
integrated postgraduate course instead of having two
separate courses of one-year each. Three universities,
i.e., PUCHD, KASH, AMU, BBAU, and BHU have
ceased their earlier one-year courses to go with an
integrated two-year MLIS course. In addition, institutes
like NISCAIR already have such integrated courses
similar to conventional Master’s level courses in other
14

Table 4 gives the number of seats offered in various
courses. In BLIS, DU offers the highest number of seats
followed closely by AMU. In MLIS also, DU offers
maximum number of seats followed by KUK. In case of
MLIS 2-year integrated course, PUCHD offers maximum
number of seats, i.e., 40 whereas NISCAIR and BHU
both offer 25 seats each.

10. INFRASTRUCTURE: FACULTY AND

NISCAIR offers only 10 papers for its two-year AIS
course along with one dissertation. Six universities offer
papers including submission of a dissertation in their
Masters’ course. GNDU provides it as an option. On an
average, all the universities offer 8-10 papers per year,
i.e., 4-5 papers per semester, in their BLIS, MLIS or twoyear integrated programme. IGNOU, in its PGDLAN
course, also has a provision for project submission along
with compulsory 14 papers, which include theory, as
well as practical papers.
Almost all the universities have included ICT in their
syllabus along with practice papers. Many of these
universities also provide an option for elective papers
from which students can choose. All the universities/
institutes provide basic papers like Foundation of Library
and Information Science, Classification and Cataloguing
(theory as well as practice paper), Information Sources
and Services, Library Management, and Information
Technology.
NISCAIR has different syllabus for its two-year AIS
course. It includes novel papers like new IT and DBMS,
and full-fledged papers on library automation and digital
libraries and intellectual property rights (elective paper).
DU in its 1-year BLIS course requires a project
submission in the first semester, which includes a
literature survey or a field survey to provide the students
hands-on experience of research. In the second
semester, the course provides one month internship
training to the students in a library in Delhi. They have to
submit a report on the activities of the library, which in
turn accounts for a paper. It also offers a newly added
paper ‘Information Literacy Applications in LIS’ in MLIS.
IGNOU has a distinctive full-fledged elective paper
on Preservation and Conservation of Library Materials
and Technical Writing. GNDU offers a unique paper on
Bibliography, Literature & Organisation of Publications in
Punjabi Language (Gurmukhi Script), which is an
elective paper.

12. CONCLUSIONS
The following trends emerged in LIS education in
northern region of India while conducting the study:


There are no LIS department in Universities of
Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand. At least one
library science department should be set up with
proper infrastructure in both these states.



In north India, out of 16 LIS departments, only six
changed their one-year BLIS and one-year MLIS
courses to two-year integrated MLIS course. Rest of
the departments are still continuing with the old
pattern of LIS education. Nine years back,
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

Curriculum Development Committee (2001) in its
report stated that LIS schools need to bring radical
change in their syllabi in view of the overall impact
of ICT on information storage, retrieval, and
dissemination as well as users’ information seeking
behaviour. It is high time that quality of LIS
education should be upgraded to two-years
integrated master’s level course to avoid duplication
of contents and for covering traditional areas as well
as new subjects comprehensively.




Eligibility conditions for admission in BLIS and
MLIS courses in different LIS department vary. Few
are offering admissions based on both merit in
qualifying examination and interview but most of the
departments are having entrance test only. The
admission criteria should be based on kinds of
professionals required by libraries. It is desirable
that performance in the entrance test and interview
along with academic qualifications should form the
basis of admission. The number of seats should
take into consideration the job positions likely to be
available in the market30.
Provision of Internet along with library automation
and digitisation software for practice were available
in most of the LIS schools. Though most of the LIS
schools have computer labs, they still lack
infrastructural facilities like class rooms, etc. There
is a need to strengthen the existing infrastructure.
Only few LIS departments such as Department at
University of Delhi have provision of intership
programmes as part of BLIS and MLIS courses. It is
also suggested that other LIS schools of north
Indian should also include internship as part of the
courses.
