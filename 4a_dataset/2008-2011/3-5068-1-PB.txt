ABSTRACT
One of the areas in bibliometric research concerns the application of most commonly used bibliometric
laws such as Bradford’s Law of Scattering. The paper gives a review of the scholarly contribution on the
various facets of Bradford’s Law. In addition to the theoretical aspects of the law, review covers papers
dealing with the application of the law in the various subject fields. A study on five-year data of journals
(2004-2008) cited by the physicists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangaluru was carried out to
examine the applicability of Bradford’s Law of Scattering, which include 690 periodicals containing 11,319
references collected from 79 doctoral theses during the period 2004-08. Ranked list of journals was prepared,
and Physical Review-B with 9.53 per cent citation, followed by Physical Review-A with 7.69 per cent, and
Astrophysical Journal with 5.47 per cent citations were the most preferred journals. Applicability of Bradford’s
Law in various methods was tested. The journal distribution pattern of the IISc doctoral theses does not fit
the Bradford’s distribution pattern. The Bradford multipliers were calculated, and the law found to be applicable
with the value of k as 1.2. The distribution of the journals in three zones was made and the number of
references in each zone was then estimated. The applicability of Leimkuhler model was also tested with the
present data.

1. INTRODUCTION
In every subject there are some journals which are
frequently referred by the researchers because of the
close relation between the subject of the journals and
the areas of research work. These highly cited journals
are listed as core journals of the specific subject. The
core journals are considered as ‘central set of journals,
which most clearly reflects the conceptual essence of
the research being reported in the discipline’1. The core
journals always contain a higher concentration of
relevant articles in a particular discipline.
The concept of core journals is derived from
Bradford’s Law of Scattering, which was formulated by
Samuel Clement Bradford in 1934. Bradford2 first
published his observation of the increasing scatter of
relevant journal articles on a given topic, and later in
1948, summarised these observations by relating the
number of journals in the nuclear, or most productive

zone, to the number of journals in successively less
productive zones containing equal numbers of papers3.
Among the several statistical expressions, Bradford’s
Law of Scattering is perhaps the most popular and the
best known of all the bibliometric concepts that try to
describe the effective working of science by
mathematical means4.

2. PREVIOUS STUDIES
Bradford’s Law of scattering has been the main topic
of many articles in LIS literature. The discussions of the
law take several directions: analysis of the law itself,
attempts to refine it, comparison with other laws, and its
applications.
The first notable paper on the law was by Vickery5
and subsequently by Kendall6. The bipolar nature of the
law was further discussed by Wilkinson7. He suggested
that the verbal formulation expressed Bradford’s theory,
3

while the graphical formulation expressed his
observations. The search for an exact formulation of
Bradford’s Law was stated by Vickery and Leimkuhler8
and was further pursued by many other authors. In 1977,
Brookes9 contributed his theory of Bradford’s law in the
commemorative issue of the Journal of Documentation.
In this classic paper, Brookes did a complete evaluation
of the Bradford’s Law and concluded, “Bradford was
therefore a pioneer in social mathematics”. Avramescu10
gave the theoretical foundation of the law. A
comprehensive review of the mathematical evolution of
Bradford’s Law was done by Oluic-Vukovic.11 Locket12
reviewed the significant studies. An empirical
examination of the Law was done by Qiu13. The gap
between empirical and theoretical considerations of the
phenomenon described by Bradford’s law has been
pointed out by Drott14.
Different authors have given many alternative models
derived for scattering. Groos15 observed a S-shaped
curve (with a droop, at the end of the curve) to explain
law of scattering. Fairthorne16 and Asai17 suggested a log
model. The dual of Bradford Law was proposed by
Egghe18. Burrel19 suggested warring process to explain
general features of Bradford’ law. Basu20 suggested that
the Bradford’ regularity acquires two pairs of description,
Bradford’s verbal law (sequence of ratios) and the
classic Leimkuhler law (equation); Bradford’s graphical
law (plotted graphs) and Brooke’ law (equation). Again
she suggested a model to explain distribution of articles
in journals based on probabilistic considerations21.

Gupta and Suresh Kumar37 in theoretical population
genetics. The Law has been applied to study not only
the scattering of publications, but in other sphere of
activities also. A study conducted by Garg and Lalitha
Sharma38 of R&D indicators in Indian industry using
Bradford’s Law bears testimony to this fact.
Many scholars have studied the application of
Bradford’s Law in the distribution of publications in
journals, coverage in international indexing and
abstracting services, etc., but few have analysed the
applicability of Bradford’s Law in the distribution of
journal citations in a particular institution. Hence, this
study on the journals cited by the physicist of IISc in
their doctoral theses becomes significant. IISc is the
premier S&T research institute in the country, where
research in all the major areas of physics is being
carried out. IISc celebrated its centenary in 2008.

3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The main objectives of the study were:
(i)

To prepare a rank list of most cited journals by the
IISc physicists.

(ii) To study the phenomenon of scattering for citation
data.
(iii) To test the appropriateness of verbal and graphical
formulation of Bradford’s Law of Scattering.

4. METHODOLOGY

The theory of Bradford Law to the calculation of
Leimkuhler Law was proposed by Egghe.22 He also gave
a note on different Bradford multipliers.23 To identify a
suitable model to explain the law of scattering,
Ravichandra Rao24 fitted about 24 different models to the
12 different sets of data. He observed that log-normal
model fits much better than many other models,
including the log-linear model. Wagner-Dobber25 have
also made their comments on the Law. Recently,
Nicolaisen and Hjorland26 in their article presented
practical potentials of Bradford Law.

A total of 690 journals containing 11,319 references
collected from 79 doctoral theses were arranged in
descending order of productivity. The study treated
references as items and journals as sources. The verbal
formulation was tested by three separate parameters for
carrying the different number of periodicals, while for
testing the appropriateness of graphical formulation, the
natural log value of the cumulative number of journals
was calculated for plotting the graph.

A number of studies were carried out to verify the
authenticity of the Bradford’s law. On the application
side, the studies of Sengupta,27 and Goffman and
Morris28 are significant. The applicability of the two vital
formulations (verbal and graphical) of Bradford’s law of
Scattering was tested by Arjun Lal and Panda29. The
data were collected from 20 doctoral theses in plant
Pathology submitted to Rajendra Agricultural University,
Bihar, during 1980-93. Gupta30 studied the applicability
of Bradford’s law to citation data in Ethiopian Medical
Journal. Other studies include, Lawani31 in Agriculture,
Tyagi32 in Physics, Nweke33 in Zoology, Asundi and
Kabir34 in Horticulture, Bandyopadhyay35 in different
disciplines, Sukla and Saksena36 in Bioenergy, and

Bradford’s Law of Scattering describes a quantitative
relation between journals and the papers these publish.
Samuel Clement Bradford, Chief Librarian at the London
Science Museum, made statistical analysis of two
geophysics bibliographies, the Current Bibliography of
Applied Geophysics (1928-1931) and the Quarterly
Bibliography of Lubrication (1931-1933)2. He tested the
journals containing references to these fields in their
descending order of productivity and then divided the
articles into three approximately equal zones or groups.
He termed the first one as the nuclear zone, which is
highly productive; the second zone as moderately
productive zone; and the third zone as peripheral zone
or low productive zone. Bradford discovered regularity in

4

4.1 Bradford’s Law of Scattering

calculating the number of titles in each of the three
zones. On the basis of the observations, Bradford
concluded that the ratio of the titles of journals in
successive zones followed a common pattern.
Bradford’s verbal formulation stated that if scientific
journals are arranged in order of their decreasing
productivity of articles on a given subject, they may be
divided into a nucleus of periodicals more particularly
devoted to the subject, and several ‘groups’ or ‘zones’
containing the same number of articles as the nucleus,
where the number of periodicals in the nucleus and
succeeding zones will be 1: n: n2, where ‘n’ is a
multiplier3.
Based on Bradford’s observations, Brookes39
suggested the following linear relation to describe the
scattering phenomenon as:
F(x) = a + b log x
where F(x) is the cumulative number of references
contained in the first x most productive journals, and a
and b are constants. This is the most widely used
formulation of Bradford’s Law.
Vickery extended the verbal formulation to show that
it can be applied to any number of zones of equal yield.
Leimkuhler8 issued the following simple function for
Bradford’ distribution, which was named after him:
R(r) = a log ( 1 + br)
where R (r) is the cumulative number of articles
contributed by journals ranked 1 through r, and a and b
are parameters.
Similarly, Brookes derivation for journal productivity
takes the form
R (r) = a log (b/r)
Further, Wilkinson7 noticed that the formulae
provided by Leimkuhler and Brookes did not really
describe the same phenomenon. Starting from the late
1960s, several mathematical formulations, models, and
syntheses of previous statements related to Bradford’s
Law have been put forth, but very little agreement exists
about which model is the best. Brookes expression of
the Bradford distribution has however gained wide
acceptance.

4.2 Theoretical Aspects of Bradford’s Law
Bradford’s Law of Scattering describes a quantitative
relationship between journals and the papers they
publish. It explains that, only a small number of core
journals will supply the nucleus of papers on a given
topic which accounts for a substantial percentage (1/3)
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

of the articles, to be followed by a second larger group of
journals that accounts for another third, while a much
larger group of journals picked up the last third3.
There are two most widely recognised formulations
of the so called Bradford’s Law: the verbal formulation
which is derived from the verbal statement of Bradford’s
conclusion, and the graphical formulation, which is an
empirical expression derived from the graphical survey of
a distribution of periodicals40.
Bradford did not give a mathematical model for his
law. Models were suggested later by Brookes, Vickery
and Leimkuhler. Several authors, while explaining the
scattering of articles in journals, have formulated many
different models of Bradford’s Law. Leimkuhler developed
a model based on Bradford’s verbal formulation as41:
R (r) = a log (1+br)

(1)

r = 1, 2, 3 …
while explaining Leimkuhler’s Law, Egghe shows that
a = Y0/log k

(2)

b = k-1/r0

(3)

where r0 is the number of sources in the first
Bradford group, Y0 the number of items in every Bradford
group (all these group of item being of equal sizes), and
k the Bradford multiplier.
R(r) is the cumulative number of items produced by
the sources of rank 1, 2, 3…r and a and b are constants
appearing in the law of Leimkuhler. In forming Bradford
groups, it is shown that the number of groups p is a
parameter that can be chosen freely.
Egghe22 has shown the mathematical formula for
calculating the Bradford Multiplier k as
k = (eγ ym) 1/p

(4)

where g is Euler’s number (eg = 1.781).
If the sources are ranked in decreasing order of
productivity, then ym is the number of items in the most
productivity sources.
Then y0 and r0 are:
Y0 = y2m log k and

(5)

r0 = (k-1)Ym

(6)

Once p is chosen, the value of k can be calculated
by using
5

k = (1.781 ym) 1/p

(7)

and Y0 = A/P
where A denotes the total number of articles.
Let T denote the total number of journals in Bradford
group, there are r0k i-1 sources (i = 1, 2, 3……p)
T = r0 + r0k + r0k2 +………+ r0kp-2

(8)

So, r0 = T/1+k+k2+…………+kp-1 = T(k-1)/(kp-1) (9)
Since A and T are known from the data set, r0 and Y0
are calculated, once p is calculated by the formula (7)
Gupta and Suresh Kumar37 have given the theoretical
aspects of Bradford’s Law and studied its applicability
using the above method. According to Brookes42, to test
the conformity of Bradford’s law, one should meet the
following three implicit conditions:
(i)

In dividing the journals into zones, the number of
articles in each zone must remain constant.

(ii) The Bradford multiplier k must be >1.
(iii) The Bradford multiplier must remain approximately
constant.

5. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
5.1 Top-ranked Journals
Core journals ranking studies are usually made to
help in the selection of journals and in assessing the
importance of one or more journals in a particular
subject field. The journals are arranged in their
respective descending order of frequency and in
alphabetical order among the same rank number. The
journal contributing the largest number of articles is
ranked as number one, next is ranked two and so on.
The criterion for ranking is purely quantitative not
qualitative.
The ranked list of most cited journals of IISc are
shown in the Table 1. In the analysis, the citation of
articles is distributed in 690 journals with a total of
11,412 citations. From the Table 1 it is clear that
Physical Review B, a specialised journal in the area of
Condensed Matter Physics published by American
Physical Society (APS) tops the list with the highest
contribution of 1087 (9.53 per cent) citations. Physical
Review A, also a publication of APS, is in the second
position by accounting 878 (7.69 per cent) articles, while
Astrophysical Journal, published from USA by University
of Chicago Press occupies the third position with 624
(5.47 per cent) citations. Of the journals of IISc, 51
journals are cited at least 37 times or more. The most
cited journals are usually well established and known
worldwide. With more available to be cited more often
6

than newer journals. Majority of the most cited journals
of IISc are being published for about or more than 100
years. Physical Review B (110 Years), Physical Review A
(110 Years), Astrophysical Journal (108 Years), Nature
(134 Years), etc.
Among the journals listed in the Table 1, some
journals include the word ‘letters’ or ‘communication’ in
their titles. These journals are letters or communication
type, such as Physical review Letters, Applied Physics
Letters, Solid State Communication, Physics Review
letters etc. The purpose of this preliminary
communication is to establish priority for an invention
and to disseminate nascent information on current
research in the scientific community. Nature and
Science, though they are not letters journals, their main
purpose is reporting preliminary communication and
current research. In general, these journals publish short
articles with a short time interval and most of them are
weekly or biweekly publications. With more new
information to be cited, it is not surprising that these
journals are receiving more citations than the general
journals, as seen in the IISc ranked journal list43. The
next remarkable feature of the study is the high status of
multi-disciplinary science journals in the core journals
list of Physics literature. It is evident from the analysis
that Nature, Current Science, Science, Proc. Indian
Academy of Science, Proc. Nati. Acad.; Sci. Proc. Roy.
Soc. London, etc. are in the top ranks in IISc theses.
The top ranked journals of IISc researchers indicate
that 8 out of the first 10 journals are published from
USA. It is also interesting to see that out of the top 10
journals, 4 journals are published by American Institute
of Physics (AIP) and 3 journals are by American
Physical Society (APS). The prestigious science journal
Nature published by the Nature publishing group of
United Kingdom is in the 9th position with 223 (1.95 per
cent) citations.

5.2 Application of Bradford’ Law
To observe the appropriateness of the distribution of
journals using the verbal formulation of Bradford Law, the
following explanations are made and the results
presented. The first part deals with the verbal formulation
of the theory based on data consisting whole periodical
references, arranged by their decreasing frequency of
citations while the second part examines the graphical
representations based on the same data.

the present study is 6 : 30 : 654. This does not fit into
the Bradford’s distribution.

For testing the algebraic interpretation of the Law,
the 690 journal titles were divided into three zones. The
Bradford’s multiplier factor was arrived at by dividing
periodical titles of a zone by its preceding zone.
Bradford multiplier is expressed as the ratio of the
number of periodical titles in any group to the number of
periodical titles in any immediately preceding group. The
basis for choosing the three zones was that the
percentage error in distribution of citations, among the
three zones should be minimum.

Here, 6 represent the number of periodicals in the
nucleus and n= 13.4 is a multiplier. The mean value of
multiplier is 13.4.

The distribution of journals and corresponding
number of citations in the three zones along with the
value of Bradford multipliers are shown in the Table 3.
In the present data set, 6 journals covered 3859
articles, next 30 journals covered 3803 articles and next
654 journals covered 3657 articles. In other words, one
third of the total citations has been covered by each
group of the journals.
According to Bradford, the zones, thus identified will
form an approximately geometric series in the form 1 : n
: n2 . But it is found that the relationship of each zone in

value of multiplier (Table 3) is not fit well as discussed
earlier. The modification is logically not correct and it will
not serve the purpose what Bradford advocated.
Therefore, the following method based on the
Leimkuhler model is employed for the verification of
Bradford’s law of Scattering.

5.2.2

Application of Leimkuhler Model

For application of Bradford’s law, divide the citation
distribution in three or more approximately equal zones
(p). Since Bradford assumes that there should be
minimum 3 zones, here also p is assumed to be 3. Then
by using the mathematical formula (4), the value of the
Bradford’s multiplier k is calculated as

a = Y0/log k=3773/log12 = 3496
b = k-1/r0=12-1/4 = 2.75 » 3
The findings of the calculations are shown in the
Table 4.
Table 4 shows that the number of journals in the
nucleus is 4 and the mean value of the Bradford
multiplier is 12.60. Therefore, the Bradford’s distribution
is written as:
4 : 4 x 12.60 : 4 x (12.60)2 » 1 : n : n2
i.e., 4 : 50.4 : 635.1 » 689.5
Percentage of error =

k = (1.781 x Ym)1/p
= (1.781 x 1087)1/3 = 12.46 » 12
Y0 = A/p = 11.319/3 = 3773
r0 = T(k-1)/(kp-1) = 690 (12-1)/(123-1) = 4.39 » 4

689 .5 − 690
× 100 = 0.072%
690

Here the percentage error is negligible. It is also
observed that, the number of periodicals contributing
references to each zone increases by a multiplier of
12.60. The data of the zonal analysis shows that the

been found to be more accurate when compared with
data and also more convenient to use.

6. CONCLUSION

Since the percentage of error is very negligible, the
Bradford’s law fits very well in this data set. The study
identified only 4 journals as the core/nucleus journals
that were most cited by the researchers of IISc, out of
the total of 690 journals. 28.02 per cent of the total
citations of researchers of IISc, 51 journals 45.60 per
cent, and the remaining 635 journals 26.37 per cent of
citations. The three zones are not exactly the 1/3 rd of
total citations as proved by Bradford. The first and third
zones are more and the second zone is less than 33.33
per cent citations, and there is no exact match in the
proportion of number of journals, nor an exact match in
the number of papers of each group.

The journal distribution pattern of the IISc doctoral
theses does not fit the Bradford’s distribution pattern,
i.e., 1 : n ; n2 . When the multiplier for the first two
zones were calculated, the Bradford’s law could be
modified as 1 : n : 4.35 n2 (where n =5 ) and this
modification fits the Bradford Law for the data set. But
when the mean value of multiplier is considered (13.4),
this modified Bradford law does not fit the journal
distribution, as the percentage of error is very high
(68.66 per cent). When the Leimkuhler model is
employed for the verification of Bradford’s law, it is found
that the law find valid for the data set. The percentage of
error is found to be the most negligible (0.072 per cent).
Bradford’s Law of Scattering is an area where much
work has been done. However, till now, no one has come
out with a single model that fits fairly well to most of the
data set.

5.3 Graphical Formulation

verification of the verbal formulation which observes
certain regularity in the distribution of scientific
publications.

The graph in the Figure 1 is logarithmic plot of the
cumulative number of journal titles on the horizontal axis
and the cumulative number of citations on the vertical
axis. If the distribution confirms to Bradford’s law, the
graph is known as ‘Bradford Bibliograph’ and it will
display the characteristics of 3 distinct regions: (i) a
rapid rise for the first few points, (ii) a major portion of
linear relation between two variables, and (iii) a ‘droop’ at
the tail end of the distribution indicating the
incompleteness of the bibliography45.

Figure 1 shows the Bradford bibliograph, where
cumulative total of articles are plotted against logarithm
of cumulative number of journals. On a Bradford
bibliograph, the core journals are those whose points lay
on the initial curved part of the graph until tangentially
becomes a straight line. The sloping part at the top of
the Bradford curve is called the groos droop. Brookes
discussed the groos droop and argued that droop was
an indication of the incomplete nature of the bibliography
examined.
