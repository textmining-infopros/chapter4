(84). The highly cited Indian publications have also been identified.
Keywords: Scientometrics, neutron scattering, neutron diffraction, India, publication productivity.

1. INTRODUCTION
The usefulness of neutron scattering as a technique
to study the dynamic properties of condensed matter
stems from the fact that neutrons interact with both
nuclei and magnetic or unpaired electrons, and
that slow neutrons have energies and wavelengths
that match those of excitations and collective modes 1 .
Neutron Scattering technique provide information
about both dynamical and the geometrical aspects
of the system under test2. The term “Neutron Scattering”
encompasses all scientific techniques whereby the

deflection of neutron radiation is used as a scientific
probe. It falls into two basic categories—elastic
and inelastic scattering. For several good reasons,
moderated neutrons provide an ideal tool for the
study of almost all forms of condensed matter.
Firstly, they are readily produced at a nuclear research
reactor or a spallation source. The neutrons cause
pronounced interference and energy transfer effects
in scattering experiments. Because the neutron is
an electrically neutral particle, it is deeply penetrating,
and is therefore more able to probe the bulk material.
It also has the advantage that the cross sections
3

for interaction do not increase with atomic number
as they do with radiation from a synchrotron x-ray
source. Thus neutrons can be used to analyse
materials with low atomic numbers like proteins
and surfactants. Neutrons may be emitted during
nuclear fission (either spontaneous or triggered),
nuclear fusion, very high energy reactions such as
in a Spallation Neutron Source or from certain other
reactions, most famously the (a, n) reaction, for
example when a beryllium nucleus absorbs an alpha
particle and emits a neutron. Cold, thermal and hot
neutron radiation is most commonly used for scattering
and diffraction experiments in order to access the
properties and the structure of materials in
crystallography, condensed matter physics, biology,
solid-state chemistry, materials science, geology,
mineralogy and related sciences. Neutron diffraction
is a crystallographic method for the determination
of the atomic structure of a material. One practical
application of elastic neutron scattering/diffraction
is that the lattice constant of metals and other
crystalline materials can be very accurately measured3 .
Evaluation is a key component of any research
and development activity. One well known productivity
indicator is the number of publications produced by
the scientists, institutions and countries. Studies
like this will provide some insight into the complex
dynamics of research activity and enable the scientists,
policy makers and science administrators to provide
adequate facilities and proper guidance in which
direction the research has to be conducted. Research
publications are clearly one of the quantitative measures
for the basic research activity in a country. It must
be added, however, that what excites the common
man, as well as the scientific community, are the
peaks of scientific and technological achievement,
not just the statistics on publications.
There are also other kinds of research and
technology development-mission oriented, industryoriented, country-specific, etc., and progress in
these cannot be obviously measured by counting
only the number of publications4. Many scientometric
studies have appeared in the literature to focus on
the performance of science in various domains 5-23 .

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the study was to present
the country-wise distribution of Neutron Scattering
research. The study was also focused on the detailed
analysis of Neutron Scattering research in India
including the aspects like year-wise research output,
subject-wise distribution, international collaboration,
authorship and collaboration pattern, institution-wise
4

publications productivity, journals preferred for
publications, country-wise distribution of journals,
high frequency keywords and the highly cited publications.

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data was collected from the Scopus database
(1991-2006). Scopus database is one of the very
comprehensive databases covering all aspects of
science brought out by Elsevier publishers. The
search string ‘Neutron Scattering* or Neutron Diffraction*’
in ‘All Fields’ and ‘India’ in ‘Affiliation’ field of the
Scopus database was used to retrieve the data. A
total of 1,808 records were downloaded and analysed
by using the spreadsheet application as per the
objectives of the study. The citations received to
the publications were retrieved on 31 August 2007
to identify the highly cited publications in the field.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Country-wise Distribution of Research
Output in Neutron Scattering
Figure1 provides the country-wise distribution
of number of publications on Neutron Scattering.
USA was the top producing country with 16,519
publications followed Germany with 10,704 publications,
France with 9,560 publications, Japan with 8,155
publications, United Kingdom with 6,366 publications,
Russia with 4,967 publications, Italy with 3,404
publications, Switzerland with 2,331 publications,
China with 2,109 publications, Spain with 2,044
publications, Canada with 2,019 publications, India
with 1,808 publications and Poland with 1803 publications.

4.2 Growth of Publications in Neutron
Scattering Research in India
During 1991-2006, a total of 1,808 publications
were published on Neutron Scattering by India. The
average number of publications produced per year
was 113. The highest number of publications 284
were produced in 2006. Figure 2 gives year-wise
growth and collaboration rate on Neutron Scattering.
It can be clearly visualised from the figure that
growth of the literature was very low during 19911995 and it peaked during 1996-2006 and an exponential
growth of publications was observed which indicates
that research on Neutron Scattering received a major
impetus during this period.
An exponential growth in number of publications
was observed during 1991-2006. The highest growth
rate 398.39 per cent was found during 1995-1998
with 309 publications followed by 110.37 per cent

31 August 2007 as per Scopus database. There
were 454 (25.11 per cent) publications which received
no citations and 1,354 (74.89 per cent) publications
received a total of 15,879 citations. The number of
citations to the publications ranged from 0 to 893.
The average number of citations received per publications
was 8.78. The list of highly cited publications published
by the Indian scientists is given in Table 8.

5. CONCLUSION
The paper analysed the contributions (1,808)
by the Indian scientists in the field of Neutron
Scattering covered in Scopus database during last
16 years (1991-2006). There were only 34 publications
in 1991. The growth of literature was very low during
1991-1995, but thereafter, an exponential growth of
publications was observed which indicates the sustained
impetus received for the research during 1996-2006.
The highest growth rate was observed during 19951998. India had highest number (169) of collaborative
publications with USA. Collaboration trend was towards
multi-authored publications. Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre, Mumbai topped the list with 425 publications
followed by Indian Institute of Science with 183
publications. More than 95 percent of the publications
were published in the journals with impact factors
which is suggestive of the publication behaviour of
