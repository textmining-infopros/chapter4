ABSTRACT
The influence of information and communication technology (ICT) in developing countries makes more
demand for web-based reliable information. Many user studies confirm that, being able to trust the information
on a website is very important to them in deciding to visit a website. Application of ICT and web hosting in
an academic environment has increased gradually in the recent decades. This paper aims to study and analyse
the various aspects of the credibility of university websites in Tamil Nadu. A total of 43 universities in Tamil
Nadu were considered which include 17 affiliated and 21 private universities. The analysis of the data represents
the extent and the level of credibility possessed by the universities’ websites in Tamil Nadu.
Keywords: Tamil Nadu, information and communication technology, university websites, credibility

1. INTRODUCTION
Websites help in accessing universe of knowledge
across the globe, irrespective of their geographical
location and anybody can publish anything in World Wide
Web (WWW) from his desktop. With the help of WWW
and related Internet technologies, any organisation or
institution can make its presence on the Internet. For
many institutions, websites are crucial to ensure sales
and services. The Internet already has a profound
influence on institutes of higher education, and this
influence is projected to further grow. It is a debatable
issue that whether all websites and web contents in the
Internet are reliable, uptodate and standardised.
Print sources come across different stages of
reviewing and filtering. Unlike most printed information
sources, in web publishing, no one has to approve the
content before hosting it on the Internet. This means that
the quality of the information found on the net must be
evaluated very carefully, because there is no surity
whether the information provided is trustworthy or not.
When a person opens a website, the first impression or
judgment is probably made within a few seconds.
Recieved on 5 November 2008

Whether the user will stay or move on to the next option is
based on the credibility and aesthetics of the website, its
ease of use, and navigation, etc. Credibility is limited to
the believability or trustworthiness of information found in
the WWW. If a website is not perceived as credible it is
unlikely to be used. The term credibility means the extent
to which the users trust the information content on a
website. This paper aims to study and analyse the various
aspects of the credibility of university websites in Tamil
Nadu.

2. WEB CREDIBILITY
Credibility is a perceived quality that does not reside
in an object, a person, or a piece of information. Therefore,
in discussing the credibility of a computer product, one is
always discussing the perception of credibility1. Many
scholars agree that credibility perceptions result from
evaluating multiple dimensions simultaneously. Although
the literature varies on how many dimensions contribute
to credibility evaluations, the vast majority of researchers
identify two key components of credibility as
trustworthiness and expertise. A person makes an
assessment of both trustworthiness and expertise to

arrive at an overall credibility assessment. "Web
credibility is about making your website in such a way
that, it comes across as trustworthy and
knowledgeable"2. In nutshell, web credibility is a
perceived quality of a website by a user, whereas web
evaluation is the process of web credibility.

3. UNIVERSITIES IN TAMIL NADU: A BRIEF
NOTE
The first university, University of Madras, was
established in 1857, which was the only university for
composite Madras state. Madurai Kamaraj University was
the second affiliated university established in 1966 in
Tamil Nadu, only after 109 years. Subsequently, a number
of universities have been established.
The impact of universal and globalisation of education
brought more number of private universities established,
especially in engineering, technology, and medicine
disciplines. However, all the universities generally fall into
the following three categories, based on their
organisational structure (UGC)3:
(i)

Affiliating universities, having university departments,
constituent and affiliated colleges, with single or
multiple campuses;

(ii) Unitary universities having university departments
and constituent colleges, with single or multiple
campuses;
(iii) Private universities, mostly of the unitary type and
having distributed campuses.
At present, conventional or affiliated universities form
a significant segment of the university system in Tamil
Nadu. As on September 2008, there were about 45
universities in Tamil Nadu4,5 (Appendix A). Almost all the
universities have their own websites. Every university is
trying to project its facilities, courses, services of their
libraries and constantly updating or improving the
functionality of its website. While some universities have
opened a portal for their libraries, some have provided a
link to it in their website.

4. OBJECTIVES
The following are the objectives of this study:


To examine the websites of the universities in Tamil
Nadu.



To collect the data with regard to the structure and
contents of the universities in Tamil Nadu.



To analyse the contents and structure of the
websites under study.

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(3)



To compare the websites of vaious universities under
study with the established guidelines.



To offer suggestions for the design of an ideal website
for a university.

5. HYPOTHESES
Hypotheses applied for the study were:


A majority of the universities in Tamil Nadu has
hosted websites on the Internet.



The university websites are heterogeneous in the
structure and contents.



Most of the websites do not confirm to the
established guidelines.

6. RELATED RESEARCH
Karp and Karp6 offered guidelines about the web
designing. Though not directly related to web credibility,
adopting those guidelines will help to improve a website.
The guidelines explain intelligent use of graphic elements
and design that can add greatly to the attractiveness of a
web page.
Fogg7, et al. gathered the comments people wrote
about each site's credibility and analysed the comments
to find out what features of a website get noticed when
people evaluate credibility. The team found that the design
look of the site was mentioned most frequently followed
by comments about information structure, and
information focus. In this study, 2,684 people evaluated
the credibility of two live websites on a similar topic
(health) and the authors shared participants comments in
the top 18 areas that people noticed when evaluating
websites’ credibility. Fogg8 also proposed a theory that
users notice and interpret various websites elements to
arrive at an overall credibility assessment.
Mangala Hirwade9 evaluated the websites of Indian
universities with special reference to their library's web
pages. Two hundred and seventy three Indian universities
were selected for this study. Out of these, 91 (59.87 per
cent) have included information about their libraries in
their websites. Major findings and suggestions were
presented and directory of Indian university websites were
created as a by-product of the study.
Jasek10 offered a short set of simple-to-implement
guidelines in his pamphlet "How to Design Library
Websites to Maximise Usability" to help librarians to
design usable library websites. The guidelines are based
on a survey of literature on library website design and
usability testing, results of usability reviews conducted by
Elsevier for library customers, and established best
practices in website usability.

Out of 45 universities in Tamil Nadu websites of 43
university were considered, evaluated, and analysed. Two
universites were excluded due to technical reasons.
There is a phenomenal growth of universities in Tamil
Nadu after 2000 (Table 1) due to the development of
private universities. Nearly 19 self-financed engineering
colleges have got university status after 2000 which is
nearly 42 per cent in the overall growth of universities in
Tamil Nadu.

'Ease of Use', 'Structure of Website' and 'Navigation'
plays a major role in the website credibility. Even large
websites fails to meet the user needs due to lack of
proper structure and navigation tools. Table 5 explains
that most of the universities in Tamil Nadu have proper
structure and logically arranged contents (93 per cent).
But more than half of the university websites do not
provide navigation tools like site map (33 per cent), search
facility (35 per cent), etc. 'Reliability' factors are the basic
factual data, which is expected from all the university
websites. Table 6 explains that almost all the universities
provide the contact details, history and copyright
information. Only 40 per cent of the universities have the
'feedback' feature and 58 per cent 'information about
faculty'. It is interesting to note that only three universities
have the provision to make complaint through their
website. Table 7 shows the variable in 'Validity' factor,
which helps to assess the importance and the role of a
website of an organisation. Majority (84 per cent) of the
websites maintain the respective sites without any 'dead
links' and are able to 'distinguish between link and line of

Table 2 explains the types of management of
universities in Tamil Nadu. In the last 150 years the growth
of affiliating universities is perpetual and the growth of
private universities is transient.
Table 3 reveals that seven types of 'URL extensions'
were observed in this study. Out of 43 universities nearly
half (49 per cent) of the universities have .ac.in as 'URL'
extension followed by .org (18 per cent) and .edu (16 per
cent). The study by Fogg, et al., indicates the 'Design
look' factor as one of the key factors for any web
credibility study.
Table 4 reveals that all the websites have graphics or
pictures (100 per cent), and in majority (84 per cent) of the
websites background and text colour is matching.
Unfortunately many do not provide information about the
screen resolution, browser compatibility, etc. The above
details are important since many websites do not fit into
one page display.

expressed information to the maximum end user. Multiple
languages or the regional language add value to the
website, but it is odd to note only four universities (9 per
cent) provide some information in the regional language.
No private university has this additional feature. At the
same time, most of the universities (95 per cent) appear in
the first page of Search Engines like Google, Yahoo and
Rediff. While majority of the universities have the
information about the 'research activities', some of them
provide the 'project titles' also.

that only 14 (33 per cent) universities have such links in
their websites. Directory of various departments'
telephone extensions will help the end users to reach the
respective official quickly, which was found in most of the
affiliating universities, whereas it is a very rare feature in
the private and unitary universities. On the other hand
'course eligibility related information' is comparatively
lesser in the affiliated universities.
Library-related factors are given in the Table 10. Most
of the universities (79 per cent) provide the information
about library with nearly 60 per cent of them with a
separate page or homepage for library. Contact
information about library, is rarely found; only 9 (21 per
cent) universities provided the information and 11 (58 per
cent) universities have separate 'library homepage'.

Table 9 depicts the factors that will add value to a
website and increase the 'customer satisfaction'. Links to
UGC, AICTE, and State Higher Education-related
websites and references will help the end user to get more
clarity on policies and procedures. The study observed

Table 11 describes the library collection-related
details. Almost 70 per cent of the websites have the
information about the 'Kind of Collection' and 67 per cent
provide the 'No. of Books' available. 'List of Journals' is
rarely provided among the private, unitary and affiliating
universities. But majority of the universities provide the
information about the 'Online or E-resources'. It was
observed that only Gandhigram Rural University has
mentioned about the 'Braille Books Collection'.

Table 12 provides the details about library services.
Unfortunately the information about libraries is brief in
most of the websites. Twenty three (53 per cent)
universities have mentioned about lending, online and CDRom service followed by reference (49 per cent),
reprography (40 per cent), and Internet browsing services.
Specialised services like CAS, SDI, etc., have rare
mention. Of course provision of such services in university
environment is a rare phenomenon.

information on placement, hostel, transport, other noncurricular activities, sports, etc., from the respective

website. It is not common among affiliated and unitary
universities. Most of the universities provide details about
alumni followed by extra curricular activities, and sports.

occupies nearly 70-96 per cent of the overall website size.
By reducing the picture size a significant size reduction
can be achieved.

enter a URL to calculate page size, composition, and
download time. The script calculates the size of individual
elements and sums up each type of webpage component.
Based on the page characteristics the script then offers
advice on how to improve page load time. The script
incorporates the latest best practices from website
optimisation secrets, web pagesize guidelines and
trends, and website optimisation techniques into its
recommendations.

Table 15 reveals the webpage size and download
speed details of websites of unitary universities. Tamil
Nadu Open University's website is the topper (very small)
among them, but the size seems to be naïve, which could
be due to different design method (Frame based). So the
optimisation tool would have captured the data from the
mirroring site, which means it is only a small and simple
website. On the other hand, Gandhigram Rural University
takes nearly 90 s to download, which is undesirable
according to the guidelines of users' studies. It is
apparent from the Table 16 that, none of the private
universities falls under < 10 s category (optimal), nine
universities falls under less than 50 s, five universities falls
under > 50 s and remaining all falls </> 100 s category.
Due to some technical reasons, the web optimisation tool
could not retrieve data from Sri Ramachandra Medical
College and Research Institute.

this study, 56 K connection rate was taken as the sample
to represent the other connection rates. According to the
web credibility users' studies done in the past, the optimal
download time for a homepage is 10 s. So for better
download results, it is suggested to design 45 kb to 55 kb
sized homepage. Table 14 depicts that there is a
correlation between the website sizes and download time
taken; typically 4-5 kb is downloaded in one second. Only
Bharathidasan University falls in less 10 s category. Four
universities falls under > 50 s category. Many homepages

11. SUGGESTIONS
(i)

A majority of the university websites in Tamil Nadu
are not updated regularly. Hence, it is mandatory to
update these regularly with date of last updation and
frequency of updation. This will add more credibility
to the site.

much as possible as they unnecessarily occupies
space and increases the download time.

12. CONCLUSION

(iv) Unlike printed information resources, the space is
not managed properly in the web. To achieve this
effectively, it is very important to utilise the space
effectively.

In Tamil Nadu, though all the universities have their
websites, they lack a standard design and structure. The
growing use of Internet among the general public including
students, staff, etc., has revolutionised the process of
university publicity and dissemination of information
pertaining to university activities, services, rules and
regulations, admissions, various sections, staff, etc.
Library webpages of universities in Tamil Nadu not only
serve as excellent media for publishing the library
activities, programmes, resources and services but also
help to bring to the notice of the user all the significant
information which they must know in developing and using
their libraries. The information provided in the webpages of
universities in Tamil Nadu and their library pages need to
be evaluated periodically using established criteria like
web design, accessibility, arrangement, etc. This will help
the universities to improve their websites according to the
users needs.

(v)

REFERENCES

(ii) Home page is the virtual front door for any website,
therefore the first impression makes the difference.
Many user-studies confirmed that, one page display
of home page without scrolling has more credibility.
The goal can be achieved if a website is designed
based on the percentage of total screen size.
Offcourse, this is applicable only if it is a simple site.
(iii) The arrangement of web objects and links are very
important. It is preferred to place them in the logical
order.

The moderate use of photos, animations, marques,
etc., will not only decrease the size of websites but
also improve the ease-of-use.

(vi) By placing the objects/links in the right place, where
these are expected to be placed, will reduce
duplication of links or objects. This will reduce size
and can improve effective utilisation of space.
(vii) Instead of each individual links, it can be grouped
under broad categories. This will also improve the
aesthetics of the site and ease-of-use.
(viii) Normally a website will have many pages. Since it is
not possible to browse all of these, a sitemap and
internal search engine will be an value added to the
website, which will increase its credibility also.
