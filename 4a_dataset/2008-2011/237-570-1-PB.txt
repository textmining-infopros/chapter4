ABSTRACT
The paper compares the status of social science research in India, China and Brazil using various
indicators. It particularly focuses on the analyses of annual average publication rate vis-à-vis global publication
share; similarity in research profile of different countries; research priorities of countries as measured in
terms of national publications output by sub-fields; relative share of international collaborative papers in the
national output; distribution of research output by geographical regions within each country; and characteristics
of high productivity institutions and highly cited papers computed on select measures.
Keywords: Comparative study, India, China, Brazil, social science research

1. INTRODUCTION
Social science research in India is largely a statefunded activity, mainly by Government of India (GOI) and
its agencies such as Indian Council of Social Science
Research, University Grants Commission, etc. The UGC
has introduced several funding programs such as Special
Assistance Program, Centres of Advanced Studies,
doctoral fellowships for creation and expansion of social
science faculties in universities, deemed universities and
postgraduate colleges. In addition, UN agencies, aid
agencies of foreign governments, international financial
agencies, and private foundations also fund social
science research. However, this share is small compared
to that of the GOI. There are at present more than 400
social science institutions in the country such as
specialised universities under the academic sector (190
institutions); governmental institutions under government
sector (67); autonomous research institutions under
agencies of the government (27); and NGOs, international
agencies, individuals in the private sector (133). The GOI
spends nearly Rs 600 crore (2004-05) per annum on
maintaining these social science institutions. Over the
years, these institutions have built up strong research
capacity and capability for research in social sciences.
Their aim is knowledge generation by advancing our

understanding of socio-economic processes, knowledge
application by undertaking public-policy-centric studies
and such other studies for catalysing socio-economic
development and knowledge utilisation by evaluating the
impact of governmental programmes, etc. The ICSSR
Review Committee reports that social science research is
mainly driven by two forces: interest in knowledge about
the functioning of society in its diverse social, cultural,
political and economic aspects and in understanding the
factors that shape them, and the practical needs of the
policy-makers and managers in government, civic society
and the private sector for reliable data and professional
analysis1.
In the past some bibliometric studies have been done
on the status of social science research in India2-5.The
ICSSR Review Committee Report also assessed status of
social science research in India based on bibliometric
analysis of sample data as published during 2004-05 in
eight select journals and on publications data on books
and monographs as published on social science themes
by eight select publishers. Findings from such a study
could be biased. For building a more reliable and objective
picture on the status of social science research in India
and understanding how this picture has changed
overtime, it is important to analyse total research output
15

on social science themes published over the last 10 years
or more and not just limit such an important study to a
select group of journals. Secondly, it would be more
useful if we plan such a study on comparative basis, and
study how India has been performing in social sciences
vis-à-vis China and Brazil, the other leading economies in
the developing world. Hence, the need to undertake this
study.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this study is to compare the
status of social science research in India, China and
Brazil by using measures such as (i) annual publication
rate vis-à-vis global publication share; (ii) similarity in
research profile of different countries; (iii) research
priorities of countries as measured in terms of national
publications output by sub-fields, (iv) relative share of
international collaborative papers in the national output,
(v) distribution of research output by geographical regions
within each country, and (vi) characteristics of high
productivity institutions and highly cited papers computed
on select measures.

3. METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCE
The present study uses SCOPUS international
database for capturing publication data of India, China,
and Brazil in the areas of social sciences. Scopus is an
international multidisciplinary database covering around
15000 peer-reviewed international journals, of which

around 4,000 are in social sciences. The study uses 12years publication data from 1996 to 2007 on India, China
and Brazil. In addition, it uses citation data for qualitative
analysis of research output. The quality of research
output has been compared on average citations received
per paper during first three years since the publication of
the research paper in the journal. Three years citations
window has been used for comparing quality of research
published from 1996 to 2004. Two years and one year
citations window have been used for papers published in
2005 and 2006.

4. ANALYSES
4.1 India’s Publication Share in Social
Sciences and World Rank
In social sciences, India ranks 13th among the top 26
productive countries with 1 per cent global publication
share. Overall, the top 26 productive countries in social
sciences have shown wide disparity in their global
publications share, between 0.35 per cent and 29.17 per
cent of the cumulative world publications output during
1996-2007. The United States tops the list with 29.17 per
cent global publications share, followed by the United
Kingdom with 9.84 per cent share. The countries that
ranked at 3rd to 14th positions have shown disparity in
their global publications share but on a narrow band,
between 1 per cent and 4.07 per cent. The developed
countries falling in this band are Canada, Germany,
Australia, Netherlands, China, and France (global

per cent), Russia (from 0.38 per cent to 0.29 per cent),
and Poland (from 0.31 per cent to 0.30 per cent). On the
other hand, other countries like the UK, Spain, Australia,
Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, and Switzerland have
shown marginal rise in their global share, varying between
0.17 per cent and 1.58 per cent during the same period
(Table 2).

4.2 Shifts in the Global Share of Developed
Countries

4.3 Shifts in the Global Share of Developing
Countries

The top 26 productive countries in social sciences
have shown shift in their global publications share over
time. In particular, some select developed world countries
have shown decline in their global publication share over
10 years. These include the United States (its global
share declining from 36.17 per cent to 24.71 per cent

The developing world countries ranking in the list of
top 26 productive countries in social sciences, except
Israel, have shown rise in their global publication share
ranging between 0.10 per cent and 2.78 per cent. China

cent to 3.63 per cent), whereas India’s rise has been
small and insignificant, 0.10 per cent (from 0.91 per cent

and 2007.

business, management and accounting as their top
productive areas of research, together contributing the
largest share in the national output (i.e. 52.61 per cent
share by China and 41.12 per cent share by India), with
general social sciences as their second priority area (with
30.06 per cent share by China and 39.41 per cent share
by India) followed by decision sciences (with 14.53 per
cent share by China and 14.2 per cent by India),
economics, econometrics and finance (with 4.22 per cent
share by China and 9.08 per cent by India), and
psychology (4.14 per cent share by China and 6.47 per
cent by India). Brazil, in contrast has shown different
order of priorities in the social science sub-disciplines. Its
largest share (25.74 per cent) is in psychology, 14.29 per
cent in decision sciences, 9.53 per cent in economics,
econometrics and finance, and 9.22 per cent in business,
management and accounting (Table 5).

4.4 Publication Growth Rate
India achieved an average annual publication growth
rate of 10.9 per cent during 1996 to 2007. In comparison,
China and Brazil posted much higher growth rate, 36.75
per cent and 24.79 per cent, respectively during the same
period. Brazil leads India and China in citations
performance. Its average rate of citations per paper is 1.66
as against 0.82 by India and 0.52 by China. This data
reveals that high productivity is a not a necessary
indicator of high quality research or excellence in
research. Brazil which posted least publications output
amongst three select countries has shown best
performance in citations per paper (Tables 3 and 4).

4.6 Collaborative Research Profile of India,
China, Brazil
Brazil registered the highest share of collaborative
publications (27.7 per cent) in its national output in social
sciences during 1996-07, followed by China (16.8 per cent
share), and India (14.9 per cent). However, it has been
found that collaborative research activity of India, China

and Brazil is not going strong. Both Brazil and China have
registered negative shift over time in their collaborative
output by 10.6 per cent and 7.6 per cent respectively,
whereas India showed marginal rise by 1.5 per cent in 9
years, from 1996-98 to 2005-07 (Table 6). The negative
shift in collaborative out put has come to happen despite
the fact that China has shown the fastest publication
growth rate of 638 per cent over 9 years from 1996-98 to
2005-07, followed by Brazil (638 per cent), and India
(103.4 per cent) (Table 7).

have had partnership with more than 20 countries for
international collaborative research. The USA and the UK
are their major collaborating partners, as individually 12
per cent to 47 per cent of their share of international
publications has co-authors from these two countries
alone during 1996-07. Their other collaborating partner
countries, accounting for 0.10 per cent to 10 per cent
share of international output, are Germany, Australia, the
Netherlands, Canada, Hungry, Japan, Switzerland,
France, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, South Korea, and
Taiwan (Table 8).

4.8 High Productivity Institutions in India
Based on analysis of publications data on India, 19
institutions were found as high productivity in social
sciences in India. Individually these institutions published
50 or more publications during 1996-2007. Together they
contributed 3860 papers, accounting for 28.39 per cent
share to Indian output in social sciences. Individually
these institutions contributed 59 to 779 publications, with
an average of 230 publications per institute. Only 5
institutions published output above the average. Their
share showed decline over time by 7 per cent (down from

these 17 institutions was 1.83. But only six out of 17
Brazilian institutions showed citation performance above
the average of the total institutions (Table 12).

5. CONCLUSION
The analysis of publications data on India, China, and
Brazil for 1996-2007 reveals that these leading developing
world economies are on the growth track; their
publications activity in social sciences is growing though
at differential rates. India’s average annual growth rate is
10.9 per cent, China’s 36.75 per cent, and Brazil’s is
24.79 per cent. China’s global publications share in social
sciences is 2.16 per cent, India’s 1 per cent, and Brazil’s
0.48 per cent. That India lags behind China in terms of
publications productivity and publications growth rate in
social sciences should a matter of concern to policy
makers and planners. These three economies also differ
in terms of citations received per paper—an indicator
used to measure and compares the quality of research
output. Brazil registered an average rate of 1.66 citations
per paper, China, 0.52, and India, 0.82. Significantly,
Brazil was able to achieve the highest average citations
rate per paper despite the fact that its global share was
the lowest (0.48 per cent) compared to India (1.01 per
cent) and China (2.16 per cent). This goes to demonstrate
that high productivity alone is not a necessary indicator of
excellence and quality of research. Brazil leads India and

China on productivity through collaborative research.
Further, the data shows that on collaboration research
activity of these economies, in particular of India, is still
not strong and dynamic one. These countries did not
register any significant shift over time in their collaborative
publications. India showed marginal rise by 1.5 per cent in
9 years, 1996-98 to 2005-07, whereas China and Brazil
showed decline by 7 per cent to 10 per cent. The USA and
the UK are their major collaborating partners, accounted
for 56 per cent to 66 per cent share of total international
collaborative publications by each country. Their linkages
with other countries are weak, accounting for 1 per cent to
6 per cent share.
At present, high productivity research is confined to
barely 19 institutions in India even as country spends over
Rs 600 crore per year on social science research and that
it commands 400 plus institutions in the country. It
appears we are not exploiting full potential of our
institutional infrastructure in social sciences. If India has
to make a quantum leap and rank amongst top five
productive countries in the world, it needs to strengthen
the research potential of social science institutions within
the country and match them to world leaders in social
