ABSTRACT
The paper discusses the scientific contribution from Madhya Pradesh (India) as per the Web of Scienceexpanded version during 2000-2009. The parameters studied include growth of publications and citations,
international collaborations, national collaborations, subject-wise distribution of publications, citations, activity
index and collaboration rate, ranking of research and academic institutions, authorship and collaboration
patterns, channels of communications, and major journals preferred by scientists of Madhya Pradesh for
publishing their research works.
Keywords: Scientometric, Madhya Pradesh, India, activity index, collaboration trend, S&T research

1. INTRODUCTION
Publication and citation counting techniques have
been used in the assessment of scientific activity at
least for the past 50 years. During the half-century of
this activity, the main thrust of interest seems to flow
along two connected but parallel paths: (i) the
bibliometric path of publication and citation counts as
tools for the librarian, (ii) and an evaluative path using
the same tools to illuminate the mosaic of scientific
activity1. The use of citations as a measure of research
quality is based on the assumption that scientists and
their published works receive citations in proportion to
the degree to which their ideas and findings constitute a
contribution to the advancement of knowledge.
As the scientific system gets larger, it becomes
increasingly difficult to gauge the direction in which
science is moving, as some parts will experience
growth, other parts show decline in growth. Published
papers, therefore, can indicate areas of growth of
science2. Scientometrics is a discipline which analyses
scientific publications and citations appended to the
papers to gain an understanding of the structure of
science, growth of science at global level, performance
of a country in a particular domain, performance of
institutions, departments/divisions, and scientific
eminence of an individual scientist. It also helps in

knowing the information-seeking behaviour of scientists
and engineers by way of identifying where they publish
and what they cite. Many scientometric studies have
been presented in the literature to focus on the
performance of science in various domains3-16.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the study is to present the
growth of S&T literature published by scientists of
Madhya Pradesh during 2000-2009 as per the Web of
Science (WoS) database and make the quantitative and
qualitative assessments by way of analysing various
features of research output such as year-wise trend of
publications and citations; subject-wise distribution of
publications and citations; ranking of institutions
according to publication output and citation impact;
authorship pattern versus citations, year-wise and
domain-wise
activity
indices;
channels
of
communications used by the scientists and
collaboration trends.

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data was collected using WoS for the duration
between 2000-2009. The Wos provides researchers,
administrators, faculty, and students a quick and
powerful access to the world’s leading citation
3

databases. Using suitable search strategy, records
pertaining to Madhya Pradesh in the address field
(Madhya Pradesh in address or MP in address or M.P.
in address or M.P. in address and India in address) were
downloaded for 2000-2009. A total of 5576 publications
and 36289 citations to these papers were downloaded.
All the records were classified into 12 broad subject
categories based on WoS subject categories. Ranking
of institutions was done based on the number of papers
and average number of citations per paper. Further, all
the bibliographic details were transferred to spread sheet
application. The data was analysed as per the objectives
of the study.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Growth of Publications and Citations
Figure 1 shows year-wise distribution of publications
and citations. A total of 5576 publications were
published by the scientists of MP during 2000-2009 as
per WoS. These publications received 36289 citations
during the period. The highest number of publications
925 (16.59 per cent) were published in 2009. While
average number of publications per year was 557.60, the
average number of citations per paper was 6.51. It was
observed that the old publications tend to receive more
citations than the latest publications as these require
notice by researchers and to find context to cite
them.The highest number of citations 6180 (15.37 per
cent) were received in 2002. The average number of
citations per year was 3628.90.
Figure 2 gives the top 20 Indian states and union
territory actively pursuing research in S&T, producing
285269 publications, Maharashtra topped the list with
37471 (13.14 per cent) publications followed by Delhi

with 35819 (12.56 per cent) publications, Uttar Pradesh
with 34152 (11.97 per cent), Tamil Nadu with 31476
(11.03 per cent), and Karnataka with 31030 (10.88 per
cent) publications.

4.2 International Collaboration
In recent years, many countries have initiated
programmes that enable scientists to have more
interactions among them, both at national and
international levels. This study also measures the
extent of international collaboration by the scientists of
Madhya Pradesh. Table 1 gives the list of countries,
which collaborated with the institutions located in
Madhya Pradesh. There were 3715 (66.62 per cent)
international collaborative papers by them with 86
countries. The USA ranked first with 617 collaborative
publications and 14571 citations, England ranked 2nd
with 358 collaborative publications and 5512 citations,
and Germany ranked 3rd with 260 collaborative
publications and 4284 citations.

4.3 National Collaborations
There were 1552 (27.83 per cent) collaborative
papers with institutes across 28 Indian states.
Chhattisgarh ranked the first with 561 collaborative
publications and 1370 citations, Uttar Pradesh ranked
the second with 290 collaborative publications and 944
citations, Delhi ranked third with 250 collaborative
publications and 685 citations, Maharashtra ranked
fourth with 233 collaborative publications and 853
citations, and Gujarat ranked the fifth with 90
publications and 191 citations. Table 2 gives the list of
year-wise trend of institutional collaborations of other
Indian states with Madhya Pradesh.

technology. However, the extent of collaboration and
their rate of growth varied from one subject to another,
from one branch to another branch of the same subject,
and from one country to another country. The major
impact of collaboration on scholarly research was the
increase in productivity associated with multiple
authorship18-20. On analysing the extent of collaboration
in S&T research in MP during 2000-2009, it was found
that only 7.84 per cent publications (437) were by single
authors and these received 1518 (4.18 per cent)
citations. There were 5139 multi-authored (92.16 per
cent) publications which received 34771 (95.81 per cent)
citations, indicating very large collaborative output from
scientists of MP.

4.8 Authorship and Collaboration Pattern

Among the multi-authored collaborative papers, the
