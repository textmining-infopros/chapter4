ABSTRACT
Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) by defecto became a knowledge organisation tool, particularly in
S&T libraries all over the world. Like DDC updations and revisions, the UDC has also been revised from time
to time and incorporates many new classes and changes in the changing context. The third revised edition
of UDC in 2005 has many changes. But unfortunately, the common auxiliaries of places, particularly India and
its states, are very inadequate even in the recent published edition of UDC. Hence, classifiers and LIS schools
all over the country are facing sever problem in assigning the numbers of newly formed states and districts
of India. Therefore, this study is an attempt to provide a solution to the above problem by giving a depth
schedule for common auxiliaries of places for Indian states, districts, and historically significant entities.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is a
system of library classification developed by the Belgian
bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine at the end
of the 19th century. It is based on the Dewey Decimal
Classification but uses auxiliary signs and symbols to
indicate various special aspects of a subject and
relationships between subjects. It thus contains a
significant number of faceted or analytico-synthetic
elements, and is used mainly in specialist libraries where
UDC has been modified and extended over many years to
cope with the increasing output in all disciplines of human
knowledge and is still under continuous review and
revision to take account of new developments. The UDC is
used worldwide, and has been published in whole or in
parts in 39 different languages. India consists of 28 states
and seven Union Territories. All states, and the two union
territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory
of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments
patterned on the Westminster model. The other five union
territories are directly ruled by the Centre through
appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States
Reorganisation Act, states were formed on a linguistic
basis. Since then, this structure has remained largely
unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided
into administrative districts. In India UDC has became a
defacto knowledge organising tool, specially in R&D

libraries as well as a teaching subject in all the LIS
schools in India.

2. WHY THIS STUDY NEEDED?
The UDC since its inception has undergone many
changes in context of growth and development,
expansion and extension and revision of new classes and
knowledge. But the need was felt since a long time for
revision and expansion of common auxiliaries of place,
particularly for India and its states, as India now is the
biggest democracy of the world and second in the use
and application of UDC in its libraries. Therefore, the
present study is very relevant and would be very useful in
providing the depth schedule numbers for India and its
states and districts.

3. WHAT IS NEW IN THIS STUDY?
The latest edition of the UDC published in 2005 is the
third edition. It only provides common auxiliaries of places
of 28 states of India, which is insufficient in fulfilling the
exhaustive need of classification.
But this schedule contains more than 700 entries
pertaining to all Indian states, union territories and their
districts. In addition, schedule also provides number of
places of religious, historical and tourists significance
415

such as Ajanta and Ellora, Amarkantak, Amarnath,
Bedagat, Bhilai, Bodh Gaya, Vrindavan, Cherapunjee,
Dhariwal, Dwarka, Gangtok, Gulmarg, Kaziranga,
Khajuraho, Konark, Mount Abu, Mussoorie, Ooty,
Pahalgam, Pathankot, Sarnath, Shantiniketan, Shillong,
Shirdi, Srirangapatnam, Tirupati, Vaishnodevi, etc. The
researchers firmly believe that this study will not only
serve as a tool to provide appropriately allott class number
to all the places in India like states districts, UTs of India
but also make aware to the world communities to the
states, districts and famous places of India.

4. OBJECTIVES OF STUDY
The main objective was to expand the common
auxiliaries of places of India and its states. In addition, the
study intended to serve the following specific purposes:

•
•
•

•

•

To identify the new Indian states and districts;
To prepare a base document for common auxiliaries
for places of India for UDC;
To incorporate the newly formed Indian states and
districts and allott numbers as per the provision laid
down in UDC;
To assign the auxiliary numbers for sacred, and
historical places and places of tourists’ significance;
and finally
To prepare an exhaustive index on common
auxiliaries for places in India for quick retrieval.

5. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
The study covers more than 700 entries on common
auxiliaries of places of 28 states and 7 union territories i.e.,
Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar,
Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman
and Diu, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,
Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala,
Lakshdweep, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur,
Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry,
Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar
Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal. Study also provides
the auxiliary numbers of religious, historical, and tourists’
significance places such as Ajanta, Amarkantak, Amarnath,
Bedagat, Bhilai, Bodh Gaya, Vrindavan, Cherapunjee,
Dhariwal, Dwarka, Ellora, Gangtok, Gulmarg, Kaziranga,
Khajuraho, Konark, Mount Abu, Mussoorie, Ooty,
Pahalgam, Pathankot, Sarnath, Shantiniketan, Shillong,
Shirdi, Srirangapatnam, Tirupati, Vaishnodevi, etc.
For developing the schedule following approaches
have been adopted:
(a) New states, districts and famous places of religious,
tourists’ interest, etc., have been taken from the
government sources;
416

(b) The auxiliaries entries of famous places are entered
according to Principle of Geographical Continuity;
(c) The schedule is expended strictly on the lines/
principles as laid down in the UDC (3rd IME Edition2005) so that consistency can be maintained; and
(d) Gap device has been followed for future expansion of
the schedule.
