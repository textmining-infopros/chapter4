ABSTRACT
Various methods have been suggested in the literature to normalise the impact factor of journals. However,
these methods have their own limitations. Present communication suggests a simple alternative method to
normalise the impact factor of journals based on average impact of journals.
Keywords: Impact factor, normalised impact factor, standardised impact factor

1. INTRODUCTION
The impact factor of a journal is basically a ratio
between citation and citable items published in a journal
and indicate the relative standing and influence of the
journal within its disciplinary boundaries. It is calculated
by dividing the number of citations a journal receives for
papers published during the last two years by the number
of articles this journal published during the same time.
However, Moed1, et al. and van Leeuwen & Moed2 have
questioned the accuracy and validity of the impact factor
of journal.

The methods suggested by Sen5 & Fromter6 exclude
review journals, while Marshakova-Shaikevich7 takes into
consideration five journals with highest impact factor of the
specialty in the calculation of the NIF. According to Pudovkin
& Garfield,8 the methodologies suggested by Sen5 and
Marshakova-Shaikevich7 are not quite satisfactory, as these
involve either the maximal impact factor or a few of the
highest impact factors in a speciality. The champion values
are not always characteristics of impact factor values of the
majority of journals within the specialty, and thus, introduce
fortuitous elements in the NIF.

Due to diversity of citing behaviour in different
disciplines, Balaban3 and Makino4 argued that direct
comparison between impact factor of journals dedicated
to different disciplines is inadequate. Using the same
rational it is not advisable to use impact factor of journals
for an inter-institutional or inter-country assessment of
research performance in different disciplines. To
overcome this problem, use of normalised impact factor
(NIF) has been suggested. Different authors5-11 have
suggested different methods to normalise the impact
factor of the journals.

Moed9, et al. suggested normalised impact factor of
journal, that takes into account both the citation
characteristics in the sub-fields covered by a journal, as
well as the composition of the journal in terms of types of
documents, particularly ‘normal’ research articles, notes,
and review articles. In the methodology suggested by
Moed9, et al. one has to examine the citations of all the
documents published in a journal X under the category C
for a particular year. Examining the citations of all
documents published in a journal is not only cumbersome
but also a time-consuming process and necessitates the
use of citation index.

According to Sen5 the impact factor of the publishing
journal is divided by the highest impact factor of the
journal within the sub-field excluding review journals,
which is then multiplied by a constant number. Fromter6
suggests another method, according to which the impact
factor of the publishing journal is divided by the arithmetic
mean of all impact factors of the category excluding
review journals.

Pudovkin & Garfield8 have suggested the use of ranknormalised impact factor to compare journal performance
across subject categories. Egghe & Rousseau10 also
suggested relative impact factor to compare the impact of
journals belonging to different fields. The methods
suggested by Pudovkin & Garfield8 and Egghe &
Rousseau10 are simple to use but have practical
difficulties. The calculation of rank-normalised impact
371

factor requires the use of Journal Citation Report (JCR) for
recording the rank of the journal in the specialty. Similarly,
for calculating the relative impact factor, one needs JCR
for recording the citations and the source items for a
specified journal in the field.
In view of the above limitations in the methods
suggested by different authors, a simple alternative
method for calculating NIF is suggested.

2. METHODOLOGY
In the suggested procedure, average impact factor of
the journals in the sub-disciplines is calculated. Based on
the average impact factor of the journals, the journals in
the sub-discipline are divided into three categories as low
impact factor journals, medium impact factor journals,
and high impact factor journals. Piecewise linear mapping
technique has been applied to calculate the normalised
impact factor. Stepwise procedure for computations of NIF
by the suggested procedure is as follows:
Step 1: Arrange the journals within a sub-discipline in
ascending order of impact factor (column 2 of
Table 1).
Step 2: Calculate the average impact factor of the
journals
in the sub-discipline using the formula
n
1
n
IF
( ) ∑ j , where, IF denotes the impact factor of
j =1
the journals and n denotes the number of journals
in the sub-discipline. In the set of journals
given in
n
1
n
IF
=
73.619 .
(
)
∑
j
the Appendix 1, n=139 and
j =1
Average impact factor is thus 73.619 /139 =
0.530.
Step 3: Based on the average impact factor of the
journals, divide the journals into three categories
as low impact factor journals, medium impact
factor journals, and high impact factor journals.
In the present case, low impact factor journals
are those whose impact factor is ≤ average
impact factor of the sub-discipline, i.e., ≤ 0.530;
medium impact factor journals are those whose
impact factor is more than average impact factor
but less than or equal to twice the average impact
factor, i.e., > 0.530 ≤ 1.06; and high impact factor
journals are those whose impact factor is more
than twice the average impact factor, i.e.>1.06.
Step 4: Calculate the average impact factor for each
category of the journals as illustrated in Table 2
for the list of journals given in the Appendix 1.
Step 5: Calculate pre-normalised impact factor (PNIF)
values for each journal by piecewise linear
mapping technique using the following formula:
⎡( AIFr − AIFr −1 ) ( IFj − Max ( IFr −1 ) ) ⎤
⎦
PNIFj = AIFr −1 + ⎣
⎡⎣ Max ( IFr ) − Max ( IF r −1 ) ⎤⎦

29.932 / 19 = 1.575

where, PNIFj denotes the pre-normalised impact factor of
the journal j; and Max (IFr) denotes maximum impact
factor of corresponding category.
In case of r = 1, i.e., the Ist category, the value of IFr-1
would assume the value of zero, since there is no
category prior to the Ist category. Hence, in case of Ist
category the values of AIFr-1 and Max (IFr-1) would be zero.
Calculation for PNIF for different categories of journals
given in the Appendix 1 are:
⎡ ( AIFr − AIFr −1 ) ( IF j − Max ( IFr −1 ) ) ⎤
⎦
PNIFj = AIFr −1 + ⎣
⎡⎣ Max ( IFr ) − Max ( IF r −1 ) ⎤⎦
Example for calculation of PNIF for different
categories:
st
⎣⎡( 0.211 − 0 )( 0.012 − 0 ) ⎦⎤
(1 category ) PNIF6 = 0 +

[0.514 − 0]

= 0.005

Step 6: Normalise the PNIF to the scale of 10 using the
following formula:
⎛
PNIFj
⎞
NIFj = ⎜⎜
⎟⎟ *10
Max

(
)
⎝
⎠

3. ADVANTAGES
The advantages of using the suggested method for
calculating the NIF are:
(a) It does not exclude review journals or any other high
impact factor journal in the calculation of NIF as
suggested by Sen5 and Fromter6, and thus takes
into consideration the wide variations in the range of
impact factors.
(b) It does not take into consideration only the journals
with highest impact factor as suggested by
Marshakova-Shaikevich7.
(c) It does not require the tools like JCR for obtaining the
ranks of the journals in a speciality as suggested by
Pudovkin & Garfield8 and data on source items and
number of citations as suggested by Egghe &
Rousseau10 as well as the Science Citation Index for
examining citations for different types of citable items
as pointed out by Moed9, et al.
