ABSTRACT
As the World Wide Web moves from the Web 1.0 to its newer version of Web 2.0, it offers transformation
of the nature of human interaction with information. This will have profound implications for education that
has shifted according to time and technology in the way it is imparted. The Web 2.0 technologies have enabled
higher order skills of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation resulting in new terms like e-learning 2.0 and Library
2.0. E-learning 2.0 has created a comprehensive suite of learning resource materials, which enable scientists
and students of different fields, particularly those from the developing world, to develop lifelong learning skills.
This has wide scale implications for the library and its services. This paper takes a look at the awareness
of the various learning paradigms of the Web 2.0, e-learning 2.0, and the Library 2.0 environment with a focus
on the geoscience education in India.
Keywords : E-learning, Library 2.0, Web 2.0, library science education

1. INTRODUCTION
Never before in the history has mankind been
connected with everybody else as he is today. This
limitless connectivity and potential to create an open
social order and system of interaction and collaboration
have been made possible only because of the high
performance and robust electronic infrastructure—
termed broadly as information and communications
technologies (ICTs). By reducing the physical component
of material and increasing the message part, ICTs
have transformed the richness of human experience,
the diversity of human languages and cultures, and
the full range of human creativity. These technologies
have empowered humanity with radical new ways of
conducting research not only in the scientific and
technical domains but also in the arts, humanities,
and the social sciences.
In the initial phases of its development, ICTs led
to the emergence of the Internet and the WWW for
access to information, thereby driving revolutionary
social, cultural, and political changes. This media for
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

information not only transformed human awareness
and expectations but resulted in digital globalisation
also. Information was widely recognised as a selfregenerative natural resource in the post-industrial
era1. As information is inherently economic, it resulted
in the utopian dream of an affluent society. Lack of
social, legal, and technological information exacerbates
poverty, which has its roots in ignorance.
The Web or Web 1.0 that most of us are familiar
with and using for some years now, has largely been
a one-way medium with the sole purpose of looking
for information. The Web 1.0 was merely an expression
of our mindsets of the way knowledge was transferred
over centuries by our gurus or teachers to their disciples.
As we further progressed into the information society,
it was realised that the issues like access and equity
to information were important enough to be taken
care of for political and economic survival. The Web
1.0 methods of information handling, preservation,
and access underwent a radical transformation from
ownership to sharing and from physical to electronic
to virtual.
5

Access to information via Internet has now reached
its second phase or edition as is evident from somewhat
audacious use of the term Web 2.0. As opposed to
its earlier version, i.e., Web 1.0 environment where
information was merely sought after, Web 2.0 environment
engages people to modify, contribute, and create
their own identities in innovative ways 2. Web 2.0 is
like a social phenomenon that not just connects
people together but generates and contributes the
web contents itself. It gives openness in terms of not
only the technologies employed, but also the ideologies
created. The ‘digital natives’ or the ‘n-gen’, as the
Web 2.0 communities are referred, constitute not
only the general public from all walks of life, but
school children and professionals from research or
higher education community also.
The aim of this paper is to examine the effect
of Web 2.0 environment in learning as implied to the
education system, followed by an assessment into
the general awareness and understanding of the Web
2.0 world and the role of the changing educational
model.

2. WEB 2.0
The ability to publish or broadcast free on Internet
has facilitated openness that is associated with values
of tolerance, individual freedom, lifelong learning,
participation, empowerment, and cooperation. Such
values give rise to open-societies, open-innovations,
open-standards, open-ecosystems, open-source, and
open-architecture3. Such an open-source paradigm is
characterised by the properties of independence, zero
cost, modularity, and regenerative capacity of the
Web 2.0. It is exactly at this higher level of interaction
and a deeper and more fulfilling user experience that
the Web 2.0 is centered around.
Some of the infrastructure and tools running the
social systems today are 4


Really Simple Syndication (RSS)



Wikis



New and revised programming methods like AJAX
and APIs



Blogs and blogging



Commentary and comments functionality



Personalisation and ‘My Profile’ feature



Personal media such as Podcasting and MP3
files



Streaming media, audio and video formats

6



Reviews and user driven ratings



Personal alerts



Web services



Instant messaging and virtual reference including
co-browsing



Folksonomies, tagging and tag clouds



Social networking software



Open access, open source and open content



Socially driven content



Social book marking (such as del.icio.us).

Teaching and learning are always dependent on
the tools and techniques used in the process. The
above technologies give us an idea of the potential
of interaction and collaboration enabled by Web 2.0
into the education environment. Though technically
such a host of infrastructure means moving from an
old era of hierarchical portals and restricted group of
content creators to search engines, aggregators and
user-based contents, knowledge-wise this means a
better integration of the different methods of presentation
with more interaction and better learning space that
allows a student to learn at his own chosen pace,
time, and place. Such tools thereby help bridge the
divide of race, age, gender, language, culture, and
geographical boundaries. It is no wonder that such
tools have proven to be useful learning aids for students
with learning disabilities like dyslexia and for the
non-native language speakers.
It is, however, important not to get carried away
by the hype supporting the Web 2.0 platform but
rather invest money in the stronger underlying ideas.
As with any technology, tools alone do not make it
useful; rather they should be integrated with the
workflow of the organisation or the individual to lead
them to success 5. Besides this, various postings
from blogs state that around 50 per cent of senior
managers do not appreciate the benefits of promoting
Web 2.0 technologies in the workplace, and a third
of them do not understand it all. Also, there is no
dearth of documentation on the perils of accessing
wrong information or information laden with inappropriate
content that students may copy and paste. While the
educational potential of social software is huge, commercial
social networking sites that allow any individual to
create digital identity and make it available to other
users for communication via chats, forums, e-mails,
and messaging poses a significant threat. A recent
legislation in the US, Deleting Online Predators Act
(DOPA), seeks to address the moral panic over such
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

sites, and the perceived dangers to school children 6.
In blogs reporting on the myths and realities of engagement
and sharing information in the online world, a certain
amount of restrain and maturity on part of the individual
in social connectivity is required. Educating the naïve
users of online engagement requires more authoritative
form of technology to ascertain our trust in technology.
The firm belief of technology solving all our problems
and liberating us from personal discipline and responsibility
thus needs an even more human touch.

3. E-LEARNING 2.0
The technical developments of the WWW allow
us to trace the history of e-learning in the stages of


The multimedia era (1984-1993)



The web infancy (1994-1999)



Next generation web (2000-2005) and



Mobile learning technologies of today.

RSS Reader Pages: This tool is based on a new
way of sharing information on a collective and collaborative
basis. RSS shares the entire page using RSS syndication
rules.
Online Office: Also referred to as the Web desktop
or the WebTop, allows applications to run at the
browser. Online office refers to packets similar to
Microsoft Office or Open Office and includes word
processors, data sheets, multimedia presentations,
etc. Such an office facilitates the production of online
documents with some history, discussion, and annotation
notes, etc. An example is the Google Docs.
Social Book Marking: As the name suggests shared
book marking is a new way of information access,
based on collaborative selective searching, e.g., del.icio.us.
Shared Videos: Youtube.com and several such sites
offer sharing of educational and instructional videos
over the web, often solving technical or size-related
problems. Some websites, specifically offering educational
materials, are Teachertube, Sclipo, Expertvillage, etc.

The new learning tools have resulted in change
in the educational goals. With technology being integrated
into all aspects of lives the digital learners of today
rarely see e-learning as a separate activity. Students
no longer rely on the old methods of memorising for
studying. Instant access to facts has replaced their
rote learning skills with skills like analysis, synthesis,
and evaluation of higher order. The collaborative instruction
techniques today focus more on the individual learner.
The Web 2.0 facilitates new learning paradigm as is
apparent in the use of the widely recognised term elearning 2.0, from its lexicology 7. In the e-learning
2.0 environment, teachers become the facilitators of
the learning process and learning by doing and collaborative
and active methods of learning become the essential
approaches to attain the new learning objectives.

Podcasting: Podcasting refers to sharing all kinds
of educational instructional materials like multimedia
presentations, written documents, and images, etc.
One can download such material for free usage.

While many e-learning websites commonly employ
a number of Web 2.0 tools, the following Web 2.0
features are more commonly associated and employed
with the e-learning 2.0 scenario 8.

Group Work Spaces: While virtual campuses have
been used in e-learning environments, the latest trend
in the Web 2.0 world is the personal learning environment
(PLE). ELGG is an example of a PLE.

Wikis: A wiki is a website that allows users to produce
or change content from the site, e.g., the Wikipedia.
Wikis can be used in education to support collaborative
work, or produce a course in cooperation or to distribute
information amongst students for the purpose of updating
materials.

Based on the eLearn magazine’s Editor-in-Chief
Lisa Neal’s blog post, ten things you can do in ten
minutes to be a more successful e-learning professional,
Stepehen Downes has outlined 10 things one can do
successfully to utilise the Web 2.0 tools to be a
more effective e-learning professional 9. These are:

Blogs: A blog is a way of distributing knowledge by
one or many authors, adding comments, or receiving
new entries via RSS readers. To support collaborative
work, teachers often use blogs to produce dynamic
learning environment without prior knowledge of html.

(i)

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

Video Online: Public open resources like Stickam.com
or Ustream.com and institutional websites often include
online videos as learning resources. Such sites allow
educators to distribute educational videos in their
distance learning or coaching sessions.
Social Networks: The theory and practice of social
networks is the backbone of the whole Web 2.0
understanding. Often seen as a community of practice,
networks like ELGG are social networks developed
specifically for the educational community.

Use the RSS feeds to run across conference
presentations and bookmark the conference sites.

(ii) Record presentations about the work or learning
materials, either as audio, video or a blog.
7

(iii) Besides GoogleSearch, use Google Blog Search,
Google Image Search, Del.icio.us, Technorati,
Slideshare, or Youtube to do a search and save
them to del.icio.us to read them later.
(iv) Write a quick blog post or article about something
learnt recently, from a meeting, or a conference
note. The idea is to make your point known to
others immediately and click submit.
(v) Always update your e-portfolio, e.g., upload your
slides, audio, video on the appropriate online
sites, code your presentations online, or describe
the links to your latest publication or projects
available online.
(vi) Use Flickr, licensed under the Creative Commons
license, to find an image and create slides using
ZOHO.
(vii) Find the blogger of your interest currently in your
RSS reader, go to their sites and follow links to
other blogs, feeds, or posts.
(viii) Write a personal comment on a blog post, article,
or book written by an e-learning researcher or
practitioner.
(ix) Go to sites like Engadget.com, Metafilter.com,
Digg, Mixx, Mashable or Hotlinks, browse through
their items and write a blog or comment on something
interesting.
(x) To end it all in a relaxing way, catch up with an
online gaming friend or watch an online video.
Baris’s Web 2.0 list offers a comprehensive list
of some Web 2.0 resources that can be used for
such activities as well 10.
The learning object repository (LOR) is the best
store house of digital reusable learning objects of the
Web 2.0 world. Such LORs are based on the
OpenCourseWare consortium and support the use
and exploitation of interoperable collections and objects
of geographic, cultural, scholarly or scientific nature
from libraries, archives, and museums. While there
are a number of links representative of the scope and
range of the LORs, the WikiEducator has a comprehensive
collection of open e-learning content repositories 11 .
Institutional repositories (IRs) that play significant
role in enhancing e-learning are examples of LORs.
Learning in virtual environment takes place at
any website of educational value and the typical
learning landscape that a student may find appropriate
for his/her e-portfolio. Also known as webfolio, it is
a web-published collection of documents, information,
8

audio, and video clips, with no restrictions on the
amount of information that can be added, deleted or
shared. Often known as PLE, it gives students the
personal space to pose questions, put up drafts, link
to comments on similar and relevant sources, and
create an adhoc learning environment best suited to
his/her own needs and capabilities 12. Such webfolios
when integrated with IRs act as LORs, facilitating the
network, discovery and retrieval of the Web 2.0 resources
in learning. Thus the Web 2.0 environment provides
a platform for students to create a digital identity.
Using the networks one can connect resources,
experiences, tutors, and enrich themselves with the
e-learning 2.0 experience lying therein.

3.1 Library and E-Learning
E-learning in the wider perspective connotes a
knowledge-centric rather than a course centric approach,
allowing the user to query the knowledge base to
learn better. Such a knowledge base is built on a
variety of resources such as documents, websites,
experts, communities, tools, and events. As a host
to many of the elements of this knowledge base,
libraries act as an enabler to the e-learning process.
The IT enablement of the learning process, besides
providing universal learning opportunities, explores
how best libraries can blend or redefine their own
systems and services so as to address the needs
of the new learning environments. It is under this
guise and more that the Library 2.0, a term brought
in from the Web 2.0 lexicology is still being deliberated
upon13.
The Web 2.0 has changed the user experience
with information. The webby networked world requires
libraries to reconfigure its services to support research
and learning activities by responding to the changing
networking-user behaviour. Such environments provide
libraries the collaborative possibilities of exposing
library services, creating and maintaining digital asset
repositories, and creating standards for interoperability.
Table 1 shows how libraries and librarians can be
involved at each stage of the e-learning process in
meaningful ways 14. The successful adoption of these
e-learning processes would mean a leap into the
Library 2.0 world resurgent with the IT world.
Librarians can work with faculty members, students,
or the IT specialists in the pre-authoring stage of the
e-learning process for the selection and evaluation of
learning materials. They can also help with the metadata
schemas for content management or towards information
literacy modules involving organising metadata for
online resources or training in information seeking,
assessment, evaluation, and consolidation of resources,
plagiarism, copyrights, and the digital rights management

(DRM) issues with respect to the duplication and
usage of digital learning materials. Libraries can provide
free downloads plagiarism software into the digital
diaries or PLEs of users. Similarly the virtual reference
service (VRS) is a powerful mean for engaging the
user in the experience of the omnipresent librarian
towards the correct discovery, and the rightful integration
and re-usage of digital materials using information
systems scattered all over the web. Library services
could be integrated with the learning management
system (LMS) such as WebCT, Blackboard, DesireLearn,
ANGEL or Moodle, so as to make accessible to all
course components direct links such as e-journals,
articles, inter-library loan, online interactive reference
service, and content resources.

(v) Creating database of free online resources, enriched
with recommendations, comments and ratings
by the librarians themselves.

Social tagging on the web has changed the purview
of information management and provision from being
a librarianship centric skill to one that allows just
everybody to categorise information the way they
want. Similarly the long held notion of authenticity
and validity of information held in the field of librarianship
has been broken by the collaborative information tools
and technologies. All over the world, libraries and
librarians are constantly reinventing and evolving themselves
in response to the changing technologies, user needs
and behaviour. Libraries worldwide are trying to maximise
online access to enhance transparency of library
operations and increase interactivity, thereby adding
new value to the users with increased library
usage 15, 16. Some of these are:

(x) Provide free space for flexible resources, vodcasts,
podcasts with a continually updated download
list.

(i)

Based on Web 2.0 technologies, libraries are
setting up blogs for online library reference services.

(ii) Libraries today rely more on informal and instantaneous
communication via instant messaging and wikis.
(iii) Libraries are offering more space within their
walls that congregate the digital natives online.
(iv) Promoting library collections and services through
Facebook, RSS feeds, and widgets.

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

(vi) Using browser tool bars on the web for displaying
the library tools, photos, and videos.
(vii) In an effort to make the catalogue more interactive,
some libraries are opting for more personalisation
tools and options for rating books as well as
dynamic floor plans showing subject collections.
(viii) Customise curriculum resource pages.
(ix) Offer Web 2.0 classes for the public on blogging,
etc.

Thus the library community with its commitment
to preserve vast stock of knowledge is in the forefront
of successfully mapping the whole of society’s knowledge
by using the relevant technologies and serveing the
readers.

4. WEB 2.0 AND THE SCIENCES
The digital resources, tools, and networks of the
ICTs, influence ways in which scientists investigate
the real world, the way they organise and communicate
what they know, and how they think. Such resources
offer effective ways of handling the geoscience information
by opening the possibilities of more rigorous analysis
with quantitative and statistical methods and more
vivid visualisation techniques. Such tools have revolutionised
the management and rapid dissemination of scientific
information. ‘E-science’, a term used for changes
related with information technology (IT) in the scientific
disciplines, used in conjunction with other terms like
e-research and e-scholarship shows the transformative
shifts sweeping across the scientific domains as a
result of the IT revolution in particular 17 .

9

The Web 2.0 has facilitated the conduct of science
and research into a global enterprise, which transcends
geographic boundaries, disciplines, and educational
levels. It facilitates the ability of scientists to work
with experts from all over the world, to use resources
across international boundaries, and to share and
integrate different types of data, knowledge,and technology
being generated in real time from all around the
world.
ICT applications have no disciplinary boundaries;
these have always been an integral part of the evolution
of various branches of science, e.g., geoscience,
which is centered on Geology. It inevitably, overlaps
into such subjects as geophysics, geobiology,
geochemistry, applied geophysics that includes geophysical
prospecting and exploration, general geology that
includes internal geodynamics, geotectonics,
tectonophysics, external geodynamics, historical
geography or stratigraphy, economic geology, and
soil science. As atmospheric science, environmental
science, surveying and geomorphology are related to
the geoscience discipline, one should not confuse
them with subjects like hydrology, meteorology or
oceanography, which are broadly into the domain of
the Earth Sciences 18. Such interdisciplinary subjects
must be catalogued with rich metadata for long-term
access involving decades or centuries owing to the
nature of the associated research challenges.

5. THE INDIAN SCENARIO
The Indian constitution makes education a fundamental
right for children in the age group of six to fourteen.
India has approximately 300 million students in this
age group. With 300 University level institutions, more
than 12,600 colleges, 80 lakh students and 4,00,000
teachers, India has one of the world’s largest highereducation systems. Despite this, the literacy rate in
the rural areas is 56 per cent. The country has a
huge population of enthusiastic younger generation
that strives to acquire scientific and technical skills,
and reading and writing in the English language. The
main challenge for the Indian education system today
is to provide basic education to all. The rising cost
of education often calls for a change from traditional
space-and-time bound institutions to ones that will
offer cost-effective but technologically enhanced
programmes. For this purpose, the educators first
need to develop pedagogically-based research programmes
and electronic courseware at different levels to adapt
teaching styles to maximise student learning.
While some of the universities in India have distance
education programmes for the undergraduates and
the postgraduates in major disciplines, their intake
and growth has been far from imprssive. These courses
10

still use the traditional paper-based notes and reading
materials, and supplement these once a week by
physical contact with local instructors for the registered
students. Some of the reasons for the non-use of
ICTs for this purpose are:


Lack of penetration of ICTs in semi-urban and
rural India.



Lack of reliable communications infrastructure.



Lack of course content, except in the IT domain.



Lack of content in vernacular Indian languages
as most of the content is still in English.



Lack of psychological acceptance due to the
absence of the personal touch associated with
classroom lessons.



Lack of teachers and experts for development,
deployment, and delivery of the e-learning solutions,
as well as experience and understanding of the
e-learning market.



Lack of standards and a long gestation period for
implementation.

A number of institutions of higher learning have
now begun to offer e-learning courses. These institutions
have the necessary infrastructure and technology for
online video conferencing and virtual laboratory setup. India is also the first country in the world to have
its own exclusive satellite, namely, EDUSAT for educational
purposes. Besides the apex institutions, EDUSAT
networking is being expanded to the remotest areas
where a college level institution is located. About
2,700 schools in the backward districts of the country
are also using this facility; this includes 10 schools
for the blind in the state of Gujarat being served by
the EDUSAT by special transmission.
E-learning solutions in the corporate sector are
reasonably well picked up in the country, with a
number of companies employing effective e-learning
strategies for its employees to remain competitive.
This, however, has a negative effect as the number
of small vendors entering with e-learning solutions
has increased. The credibility of such stakeholders
cannot be ascertained as there is no regulatory body
in the Government.
India has one of the youngest population in the
world and is going to remain young for the next
15 years. This young generation of the country is as
net savvy and digital as that of any other part of the
world. As such, these n-gens are achievement oriented,
selective, manage their time, are practical, and use
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

the Web 2.0 tools to create their own digital identities.
The webby world in its various versions has made a
mark for itself within India and the netizens of the
country will adapt any of the Web 2.0 technologies
with as much fluidity as those for the next generation
web, the Web 3.0.
Libraries in India are not yet equipped with the
necessary infrastructure to face the challenges of elearning in the broader term. There are very few initiatives
in the fields of digital libraries, institutional repositories,
and open access publishing. Such initiatives could
be harnessed to aggregate, create and disseminate
a knowledge base, and leverage the e-learning environment
in the country. Besides the personal web spaces like
blogs, podcasts, etc., of a few enterprising librarians,
there are only few instances of bringing the Web 2.0
environment into the library settings in India. This is
contrary to the fact that such open technologies of
the Web 2.0 would help overcome economic barriers
that are often imposed by technologies, and are
aimed at addressing the digital divide if harnessed
to its full potential.

6. E-LEARNING AND LIS EDUCATION
The challenge today is for raising awareness,
especially for those researchers and library members
who are not web-savvy. Making them literate in the
use and application of the Web 2.0 tools into their
personal and professional life is the first task the
library community should engaged in. This could be
a starting point for the information literacy modules
to gain momentum within the library community in
India. The library science schools in the country have
a direct responsibility in doing so. This can be done
in two stages, viz., by training the existing generation
of librarians who are already employed, and by educating
the up-coming generation of LIS students in ICT skills
in general and e-learning concepts in particular.
The librarians first will have to learn the dynamism
of e-learning and the pedagogical issues involved. At
an operational level, they will have to manage and
administer the virtual learning environment. To start
with, the essential building blocks for the same can
be developed on the following lines:


Study, review and organise the e-learning products
with clear agenda for organisational needs.



Learn to work through interoperability.



Develop suitable infrastructure to support environment
for e-learning.



Create content, prepare a list of web-enabled
resources available in the library.

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)



Prepare pathfinders for searching information through
important reference sources, encyclopedias, world
of learning, handbooks, industrial guides, government
publications, gazetteers, list of awardees, institutions
granting scholarships, day-to-day news analysis,
research reportsin such a way that they form a
ready reckoner for learners.



Provide links through library’s homepage to relevant
e-resources, institutions, research centres, universities,
full-text and/or free-text services.



Manage the contents through metadata schema
and federated searching services through
interoperability.



Monitor the delivery of contents through free/feebased access and networked system.



Prepare expert systems, subject gateways on a
small scale to suffice local needs.



Distribute the new web resources via mailing
lists, listservs or discussion groups.

The drive towards e-learning requires libraries to
adapt to the needs of the increasing online user
population. System developers and librarians together
should provide a mechanism that would support the
e-learning initiatives and the environment. The creation
of technical standards and specifications would be
the immediate task ahead in near future.
The library science schools must take steps to
revise their syllabus to include practice-oriented ICT
skills. Much has been talked and discussed these
days on this issue through discussion forums, conferences,
listservs, seminars, and so on. The fixed framework
of syllabus has certain limitations as it cannot
accommodate everything which should be ideally part
of the course content. It is not an easy task to
ascertain the priorities and relevance of traditional
and non-traditional subjects and what should be dropped
while revising the syllabus, as the traditional subjects
also have their importance and place of their own.
There are number of steps involved before getting the
syllabus approved and implementing the same. Availability
of competent and dedicated faculty is yet another
issue. Higher education is facing a number of challenges
today. Social, political, and economic pressures are
mandating. The overall education system is confronting
and entrapped ‘mass education versus class education’
with no clear agenda for the same, except lot of
paper work and too many discussions. There is a
visible education divide between haves and havenots
as far as infrastructural facilities, teaching, guidance,
and sustainability is concerned. Library science education
is no exception to this. E-learning in library science
11

represents a pair of variables studied together for
knowledge produced within the organisation and that
produced outside the organisation. Introducing shortterm courses first and then developing electronic
courseware suitable to the home situation to exploit
the power of e-learning, possibly could be a viable
solution in present situation. In the move towards elearning or virtual learning, while the focus on technology
is important, the educators need to think about issues
of pedagogy to promote effective teaching and learning.

7. CONCLUSION
The right implementation of proper ICTs can help
solve a number of problems pertinent to the Indian
education scenario. For example, a combination of
virtual classroom, online tutorials and digital libraries,
and or the virtual reference tools in local language
could help the rural Indian youth to compete with the
outside world and move towards information literacy
path irrespective of their socio-economic status. Elearning could be a powerful tool for lifelong training
for workplace employees and will help them remain
competitive. It is thus a successful tool to re-skill
large workforces that become redundant over the
time. There is a need for library advocacy. Decisions
made at all levels of government and within the institute
about funding, copyright, telecommunications, intellectual
freedom, and other policy issues need to address the
role of libraries. Librarians should get representation
in decision making process regarding e-learning initiatives
within the organisations.
Thus, by adapting ourselves and our libraries to
the everchanging information world, we can make the
academic and other research libraries as centres of
resources within any learning environment. Thereby,
we can look forward to the dream of Rabindranath
Tagore:
“Where the mind is without fear; Where the
world has not broken up into fragments by
narrow domestic walls; Where words come out
from the depth of truth; into that heaven of
freedom, my Father, let my country awake”.
