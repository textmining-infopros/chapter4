ABSTRACT
This study examines India’s performance in S&T on several quantitative measures including India’s global
publication share, rank and growth rate, its publication share in various subjects in terms of national and global
context using 15 years publications data (1996-2010) from the Scopus database. It also determines share
of its international collaborative papers at the national level as well as across subjects and analyses the
geographical distribution of its research output. In addition, it analyses the highly productive institutions and
characteristics of high-cited papers.
Keywords: Scopus, quantitative measures, publication data, scientometrics, research analysis

1. INTRODUCTION
Science and technology (S&T) has been central to
India’s development efforts since the time of
Independence. Even though there have been shortfalls,
limitations, and missed opportunities, India has made
substantial progress in a number of areas-reasonably
high rates of economic growth, considerable food
security, substantially high average life expectancy,
growing literacy rates, success in higher education, etc.
In bringing about these socio-economic changes, the
S&T policy and approach which have been formulated in
various five year plans by taking guidance from the
Scientific Policy Resolution of the year 1958, the
Technology Policy Statement of 1983 and Science and
Technology Policy of 2003 have played a considerable
important role.
At the time of independence, the S&T base of the
country was very small. But, today it consists of a wide
spectrum of infrastructure in terms of higher education
institutions, research laboratories and institutions, inhouse R&D establishments, etc., covering several
disciplines. Indian investments in S&T have also grown
many-fold, from Rs 163.6 billion (US $3.8 billion) in 2005061 to Rs 284 billion (US $5.8 billion) in 2009-10. India’s
R&D intensity increased only slightly from 0.80 per cent
in 2003 to 0.88 per cent in 2007 of GDP, the share of the

business enterprise sector in gross domestic expenditure
on research and development (GERD) leapt from 18 per
cent to an estimated 28 per cent during the same
period2.Several bibliometric studies have so far attempted
to look at indicators as require for understanding the
status of S&T in India3-9. They had focused on developing
indicators on institutional productivity, national
productivity, scattering of research across Indian and
foreign journals, quality of research, and nature of
collaboration, etc.
Another important study10 had reported several
important indicators to understand the progress in Indian
science and technology, covering the period 1985-1986,
1995-2006 and 2001-2002. Raghuraman11, et al.
compared research performance of Indian institutions with
foreign institutions on selected bibliometric parameters.
A more recent study12 compared overall S&T publications
output of India, China, and South Korea across 20 broad
subjects as defined by Scopus bibliographical database.
The present study seeks to build Indian S&T indicators by
examining and analysing 15-years continuous S&T
publications data from India for the purpose.

2. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this study are: (i) to analyse India’s
publications growth and global share in comparison with
359

select leading countries; (ii) to analyse its research
priorities as reflected in its subject areas distribution; (iii)
to identify its share of international collaborative papers,
leading countries collaborating with India and as well as
its international collaborative publications share across
subjects; (iv) to determine its productive and weak
geographical regions; and (v) to understand the
characteristics of its highly productive institutions and
cited papers.

3. METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCE
The publications data (derived from Scopus database
from 1996 to 2010) on India and select countries forms the
basis of this study. Scopus has a world wide coverage, of
which more than half of the Scopus contents originate
from Europe, Latin America and the Asia and the Pacific
Region. Scopus coverage of Indian journals is much
higher, compared to Web of Science database. The study
used larger data set covering 15 publication years in order
to ensure that the study reflects a more accurate and
reliable results. The study has used a number of absolute
publications, citation and collaborative measures for
depicting India’s status in science and technology from
1996 to 2010.

4. ANALYSIS
4.1 India’s Publication Share and Rank in the
World
India ranks 10 among the top 20 productive countries
in science and technology, with its global publications
share of 2.32 per cent as computed from cumulative world
publications data for 1996-2010 (Table 1). The other
countries in the top 20 list that contributed world share
similar to that of India are Spain, Australia and Russia (in
the range 2.15 per cent to 2.53 per cent). In overall, the
global publication shares of the top 20 productive
countries in S&T from 1996-2010 ranged from 1.03 per
cent to 22.77 per cent. The United States tops the list with
its global publication share of 22.77 per cent during 19962010, followed far behind are China, United Kingdom,
Japan, and Germany (their global publication share
ranging 6.07 per cent to 8.32 per cent). Other countries
rank between 6th and 20th positions, with their publications
share between 1.02 per cent to 4.45 per cent. The
publications share of most developed countries (except
Spain, Canada, and Australia) has declined over the last
15 years. In contrast, all developing countries included in
top 20 productive countries have shown significant rise in
their publications share, rising from 3.20 per cent to 6.39
per cent and to 12.75 per cent during 1996-2000, 2001-05
and 2006-10, respectively. China, in particular, improved
its world ranking from 8th position during 1996-2000 to 4th
during 2001-05 and to 2nd during 2006-10. South Korea has
also improved its world share (from 1.16 per cent to 1.25
th

360

per cent and to 2.38 per cent), Taiwan (from 1.02 per cent
to 1.22 per cent and to 1.65 per cent), and Brazil (from
0.97 per cent to 1.25 per cent and to 1.84 per cent) during
the corresponding block years.
The world ranking of these three developing countries
also improved-South Korea (from 16th to 14th and to 12th),
Taiwan (from 18th to 18th and to 16th), and Brazil (from 20th
to 17th and to 14th) during corresponding block years. India
also witnessed rise in its world publications share. The
shift in its global share was from 1.89 per cent to 2.03 per
cent and to 2.78 per cent during 1996-2000, 2001-05 and
2006-10, respectively. Correspondingly, it improved its
world ranking from 13th position during 1996-2000 to 12th
during 2001-05 and to 10th during 2006-10 (Table 1).

4.2 India’s Publication Growth Rate in the
World Context
The developed and developing countries differ
significantly in their annual average publication growth
rate as seen from their annual publications output data
during 1996-2000 to 2006-10 in S&T. It was 2.24 per cent
to 7.08 per cent for developed countries and 9.59 per cent
to 11.35 per cent for developing world. Whereas the
developed countries maintained slow pace of growth in
their publications output, the developing countries on the
other hand have shown significantly faster growth rate
(Table 2).
India achieved annual average growth rate in
publications output at 9.32 per cent as seen from its
publications output data for 1996-2010. China showed
growth rate of 19.45 per cent per annum, the highest
amongst top 20 countries, followed by South Korea
(13.12 per cent), Brazil (12.64 per cent), and Taiwan (9.50
per cent) (Table 3).All countries from the developing world
(among top 20 productive countries) have shown growth
rate of their annual publications output higher than the
average (7.10 per cent) during 1996-2010 are shown in
Table 2. The countries from the developed world (among
top 20 productive countries) that have shown growth rate
lower than the average (7.10 per cent) during 1996-2010
(Table 3). Growth rate of publications output by developing
countries has also changed over the period of time. Based
on publications output data for 1996-2000 to 2006-2010, it
was found that China improved its growth rate from 13.43
per cent to 28.69 per cent, India from 3.05 per cent to
13.70 per cent and Taiwan from 4.54 per cent to 8.39 per
cent, as against decrease in South Korea from 14.65 per
cent to 8.04 per cent and Brazil from 12.29 per cent to
12.08 per cent (Table 2).

4.3 Subject Profile of India in Science and
Technology
As per publications output data for 1996-2010, India’s
research profile by broad disciplines emerges as follows:

Physical science subjects together contributed the
highest publication share (41.06 per cent), followed by
engineering sciences (32.69 per cent), life sciences
(30.05 per cent), and health sciences (22.17 per cent) in
cumulative national publication output of India during
1996-2010.
India’s subject profile is quite different from that of
China, South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil. For example,
compared to India, China, South Korea, and Taiwan each
contributed the highest publication share (56.15 per cent,
50.69 per cent, and 49.95 per cent) in engineering,
followed by 37.05 per cent, 38.24 per cent and 34.06 per
cent in physical sciences, 15.39 per cent, 23.66 per cent
and 18.28 per cent in life sciences, and 12.525 per cent,
16.51 per cent and 21.78 per cent in health sciences
during similar period.
In contrast, Brazil emphasis equally (36.70 per cent,
30.62 per cent and 33.75 per cent) in life sciences,
physical sciences and health sciences, and 22.59 per
cent in engineering sciences (Table 3).

4.3.1 Subject Areas of Research in India
Medicine, chemistry, engineering, physics, materials

contributing publication share between 12.04 per cent
and19.40 per cent in the cumulative national publication
output of the country during 1996-2010. Pharmacology,
toxicology and pharmaceutics, computer science,
environmental
sciences,
chemical
engineering,
mathematics, earth and planetary sciences, and
immunology and microbiology are the seven medium
productive subjective areas of Indian research, each
contributing between 3.70 per cent to 7.33 per cent share
in the cumulative publication output by India during 19962010. Energy, veterinary science, and neurosciences are
the three low productive subject areas contributing
publications share between 1.28 per cent and 2.37 per
cent in cumulative publication output by India during 19962010. Public health nursing and dentistry are the three
least productive Indian subject area contributing each < 1
per cent publication share in cumulative publication
output during 1996-2010. The largest increase of 6.39 per
cent (from 3.15 per cent to 9.54 per cent) in national
publications share from 1996-2000 to 2006-2010 has
been observed in computer science, followed by 4.16 per
cent in medicine, 3.58 per cent in engineering, 2.69 per
cent in pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics,
1.53 per cent in materials science, 1.42 per cent in
biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology and from
0.21 per cent to 0.75 per cent in mathematics, energy,
chemical engineering, dentistry, environmental science,
nursing, immunology and microbiology, chemistry,
361

neurosciences and public health. Compared to these
subjects, there was a decrease in national publication
share of 3.93 per cent (from 14.43 per cent to 10.50 per
cent) in agricultural and biological sciences, followed by
1.83 per cent in earth and planetary sciences, 0.91 per
cent in veterinary sciences and 0.21 per cent in physics
from 1996-2000 to 2006-2010. In terms of global
publication share in 20 broad subjects during 1996-2010,
the largest publication share (5.49 per cent) in India is

India had contributed 538609 papers in science and
technology during the last fifteen years from 1996 to 2010
as reflected in Scopus international database. The
cumulative Indian research output in science and
technology increased from 110454 papers during 19962000 to 276680 during 2006-2010, showing a growth rate
of 150.49 per cent. The total Indian research output during
1996 to 2010 has grown at an annual average growth rate
of 9.32 per cent. The annual average growth rate of Indian
publications in science and technology has increased
from 3.05 per cent during 1996-2000 to 13.70 per cent
during 2006-2010. India’s global publications share and
rank in science and technology is still very small (2.32 per
cent share and 10th rank) during 1996-2010. However, its
global publications share has increased from 1.89 per
cent during 1996-2000 to 2.78 per cent during 2006-2010
and its global publication rank from 13th to 10th during the
same period. In India’s research profile, physical science
subjects together contributed the highest publication
share (41.06 per cent), followed by engineering sciences
(32.69 per cent), life sciences (30.05 per cent), and health
sciences (22.17 per cent) in cumulative national
publication output of India during 1996-2010. Among the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(5)

cumulative national contribution of 20 broad subject areas
in Indian S&T during the last 15 years from 1996 to 2010:
(i) medicine, chemistry, engineering, physics, materials
science, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology
and agricultural and biological sciences are considered
the seven high priority areas of Indian S&T (each subject
contributing publication share between 12.04 per cent and
19.40 per cent), (ii) pharmacology, toxicology and
pharmaceutics, computer science, environmental
sciences, chemical engineering, mathematics, earth and
planetary sciences and immunology & microbiology are
the seven medium productive subjective areas of Indian
research (each subject contributing publications share
between 3.70 per cent to 7.33 per cent), (iii) energy,
veterinary science and neurosciences are the three low
productive subject areas (each subject contributing
publications share between 1.28 per cent and 2.37 per
cent) and (iv) public health nursing and dentistry are the
three least productive Indian subject areas (each subject
contributing publications share less than 1 per cent).
Among these 20 broad subjects, computer science had
showed the largest increase of 6.39 per cent in national
publications share of India, followed by 4.16 per cent in
medicine, 3.58 per cent in engineering, 2.69 per cent in
pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics, 1.53 per
cent in materials science and
1.42 per cent in
biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology from 19962000 to 2006-2010.
Among the India’s contribution to global research
output in broad 20 subjects during 1996-2010, the largest
publications share (5.49 per cent) comes from veterinary
science, followed by chemistry, pharmacology,
toxicology and pharmaceutics and agricultural and
biological sciences (from 4.05 per cent to 4.93 per cent
share), materials science, environmental science,
chemical engineering and physics (from 3.04 per cent to
3.68 per cent share), energy, immunology and
microbiology,
earth
and
planetary
sciences,
mathematics, biochemistry, genetics .and molecular
biology, computer science and engineering (share from
2.00 per cent to 2.61 per cent share) and dentistry,
medicine, public health, neurosciences and nursing (from
0.52 per cent to 1.93 per cent share). India has improved
its global publication share in 19 out of 20 broad subjects
varying from 0.11 per cent to 2.48 per cent from 1996-2000
to 2006-2010, with largest increase of 2.80 per cent in
dentistry, followed by 1.91 per cent in chemistry, 1.75 per
cent in immunology and microbiology, 1.64 per cent in
environmental science, 1.35 per cent in biochemistry,
genetics and molecular biology, 1.31 per cent in chemical
engineering, 1.18 per cent in materials science, 1.14 per
cent in physics and 1.03 per cent in computer science.
India still lacks equitable distribution of resources as
its 9 geographical states/union territories still continue to
contribute very little cumulative publications share (< 1
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(5)

per cent) in science and technology during 1996-2010. In
contrast, only six geographical states/union territories,
namely, Maharashtra Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West
Bengal and Uttar Pradesh contribute publications share
ranging from 10.07 per cent to 14.16 per cent in India’s
total cumulative publication output during 1996-2010.
The top 100 most productive Indian organisations,
publishing 1278 and above papers together contributed
54.92 per cent share (295827 papers) in the cumulative
publications output of India during 1996-2010.They
include: (i) 14 institutes of national importance, (ii) 27
research institutes, (iii) 44 universities, (iv) 9 medical
colleges and hospitals and (v) 6 other institutes of higher
education. Among these four type of Indian organisations:
(i) the universities contributed the highest publications
share of 20.80 per cent, followed by by institutes of
national importance (18.71 per cent), research institutes
(14.78 per cent), medical colleges and hospitals (3.42 per
cent) and other institutes of higher education (1.76 per
cent), (ii) the highest average productivity per institution of
7198 was achieved by institute of national importance,
followed by research institutes (2848 papers), universities
(2687 papers). Medical colleges and hospitals (2050) and
other institutes of higher education (1359 papers); (iii) the
highest h-index of 166 was achieved by research
institutes, followed by institutes of national importance
(165), universities (142), medical colleges and hospitals
(82) and other institutes of higher education (53); (iv) the
highest share (26.98 per cent) of high cited papers in
India’s total output of high cited papers was achieved by
research institutes, followed by institutes of national
importance (26.92 per cent), universities (19.18 per cent),
medical colleges and hospitals (3.18 per cent) and other
institutes of higher education (0.66 per cent) and (v) the
highest share (20.60 per cent) of international
collaborative papers was achieved by research institutes,
followed by institutes of national importance (20.01 per
cent), universities (17.33 per cent), other institutes of
higher education (15.17 per cent) and medical colleges
and hospitals (11.23 per cent).
From the above, it is clear that research institutes and
institutes of national importance have shown comparative
better performance in terms of average output and quality
measured in terms of h-index, share of high cited papers
and share of international collaborative papers, compared
to universities, medical colleges and hospitals and other
institutes of higher education. India’s share of
international collaborative papers in the cumulative
publications output was 15.98 per cent during 1996 to
2010, compared with 12.19 per cent for China, 21.05 per
cent for South Korea and 25.35 per cent for Brazil during
the same period. Its international collaboration was
highest (36.58 per cent) during 1996-2010, followed by
Germany (13.00 per cent), United Kingdom (11.97 per
cent), Japan (9.10 per cent), France (7.65 per cent),
369

etc. India had published 1668 high-cited papers in
SandTin last 15 years, with citations varying from 100 to
3429 citations per paper. Of these 1668 papers, 875
were international collaborative. In overall, Indian
participation in these 1668 papers was confined to large
number of Indian institutions: Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore (with 137 papers), followed by Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research, Mumbai (71 papers), Indian
