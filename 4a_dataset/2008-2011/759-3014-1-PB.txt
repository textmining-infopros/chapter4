ABSTRACT
Sources of information available via the Internet are increasing exponentially, leading to steady increase
in the use of Internet for education and research. Since past few years, free online information sources like ejournals, e-books, e-databases have increased considerably. Earlier, information and knowledge were passed
by word of mouth or through manuscripts, and communication was a slow process. Today, it is passed from
one individual to an infinite number of other users through a number of media and formats which makes rapid
and widespread dissemination of information possible. This paper discusses utilisation of digital resources by
faculty and research scholars of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli. Results show that 67.14
per cent of the faculty is familiar with the use of digital resources, and majority of these members are using
digital resources for research purpose. Study also reveals that majority of the faculty members are learning
the required skills for the usage of digital resources through self-study.
Keywords: Digital resources, Internet, e-mail, search engines, CD-ROM, faculties

1. INTRODUCTION
The major developments taking place in library and
information centres today are the widespread availability
and use of various kinds of electronic learning
resources. Electronic learning materials have
increasingly become the focus of research and
development of any institution in the recent years. The
commonly available electronic resources namely CDROMS, OPACs, web databases, Internet, and other
networked information sources are competing with, and
in some instances replacing the print-based information
sources, which have been in place for centuries as the
primary medium for storage and communication of
recorded information1.
The term ‘e-library’ refers to information accessed
through electronic sources like Internet. Unlike
traditional libraries, e-libraries are not limited by location
or time. Libraries have changed with the emergence and
application of information technology (IT). Libraries have
assumed the role of educators—teaching users to find,
evaluate and use information both in the library and over
electronic networks. As the use of e-library continues to
soar, users are expected to develop information literacy

skills. These skills, as Julien2 observes, will enable
users to make efficient and effective use of information
sources. The main purpose of the present study is to
investigate the users searching behaviour for retrieval of
information on the Web2. The study also aims to know
the use of CD-ROM, online databases, online journals,
Internet, e-mail and search engines, and also methods
of learning digital resources by faculty members.

5. LITERATURE REVIEW
Ajuwon3 studied physicians’ use of Internet for
health information for patient care at the University
College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, Nigeria. The findings
revealed that 98 per cent of the respondents used
Internet. A majority (76 per cent) accessed Internet from
cyber cafes. Ninety per cent reported that they obtained
information for patient care from the Internet. Of the 90
per cent, 76.2 per cent searched a database.
Asemi4 did a case study of Medical Sciences
University of Isfahan, Iran. The results of the study
showed that all the respondents used Internet frequently
because all faculties had an Internet connection. It was
revealed that the researchers of the university were
getting quality health information and patient care
through Internet. Fifty-five per cent of respondents
searched Internet for scientific health information
because the university library provided access to
databases and online journals to both students and
staff.
Barker5 discussed the growing importance of
electronic publishing in a case study, involving, Intranet/
Internet and CD-ROM, to illustrate the influence that
online books and other forms of electronic document
might have on conventional publishing process.
Chestnutt and Reynolds6 conducted a study of 457
dentists in Wales to identify how patient information on
Internet has influenced the delivery of oral care and how
the practitioners were using Internet. Thirty-nine per cent
of respondents agreed that information gained from
Internet had led to patients demanding inappropriate
care.
Hanrong Wang7, et al. analysed the impact of
Internet and stated network technology academic
libraries in China and found great development and
innovation and the latest development of reference
services in academic libraries in mainland China by
reviewing these services.
Bonita8 explained the contrasts between traditional
problems of document access and delivery with the

International (UMI). The new UMI information delivery
system integrates CD-ROM technology, digital image
technology, retrieval software, and computer hardware.
Abstract and index citations were linked with full-text
page images which are immediately available for viewing
or printing.
Lohar and Roopashree9 analysed data to cover the
use of electronic resources, how the electronic
resources improved the academic career of the faculty,
and the problems faced while using the electronic
resources. They conclude that the main intention of the
use of electronic resources was the academic interest of
the users.
Natarjan10

comparison and usage of electronics and print journals.
He also discussed use of electronic journals by
undergraduates and graduates in an academic
environment, behaviour of people towards e-journals, and
the future of the print media.

faculty members and research scholars. The completed
questionnaires were personally collected after one week.
About 140 filled questionnaires were returned; out of
which, ten questionnaires were rejected from the
ultimate sample as they were not properly filled. The
analysis of the data obtained through the questionnaires
provided an in-depth interpretation for fulfilling the
objectives.

Steffy and Meyer11 reported the results of a survey of
CD-ROM use at the Jean and Alexandar Heard Library,
Vanderbilt University, Tennessee. CD-ROM users were
analysed by status (graduate, undergraduate, faculty,
staff and other). Relative use of 20 CD-ROM products
was studied by patron status. Data was presented for
users ratings of: ease of use, satisfaction with numbers
of citations retrieved, and value of citations retrieved.
User’s suggestions to improve the products, the time
spent searching products, and the time patrons spent
conducting their searchers were reported. Patrons who
used CD-ROM liked these enough to recommend these
to their friends.

7.2 Faculty and Research Scholars’ Familiarity
with Digital Resources

Tenopir12 conducted a survey of university libraries in
the USA in 1994 to discover the impact of Internet
connections on reference services. Among the issues
highlighted by the survey were: Traffic congestion, in
that there were insufficient workstations for users, users
using the Internet for inappropriate purposes, and users
viewing pornography on the Internet.

The distribution of faculty members and research
scholars according to their familiarity to use digital
resources is shown in Table 2. It is evident that 67.14 per
cent of the faculty members and research scholars were
familiar with digital resources, while 32.86 per cent of the
faculty members and research scholars replied in the
negative.

It is clear from Table 1 that in case of faculty and
research scholars 34.28 per cent of respondents
belonged to <30 age group, 29.28 per cent of
respondents belonged to 31-40 age group, 23.57 per
cent of respondents belonged to 41-50, and 12.85 per
cent of respondents belonged >50 age group.

10. CONCLUSION
The fast growth of ICT and particularly the Internet
has changed the traditional methods of research,
storage, retrieval and communication of scholarly
information. Now-a-days digital resources has emerged
as the most powerful medium for storage and retrieval of
information. In the electronic environment, libraries need
to recognise that they are not the only one in distributing
knowledge.
The 24 hour online bookshops can provide reference
services as well as information to the global information
users. This study concludes that library and information
science professionals should be well aware of the digital
29

resources available in the concerned field of study and
evaluate these before subscribing these for their library
users.
