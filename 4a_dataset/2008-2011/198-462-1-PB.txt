ABSTRACT
The year 2007 marked the bicentenary of an act of parliament that abolished slave trading in the
British empire. Throughout the UK, British heritage and educational institutions, the government sector,
and other organisations decided to use this anniversary to look at the legacy of the slave trade as a
vehicle for community outreach, sharing of their collections through imaginative, moving, and provocative
online projects that also address contemporary issues related to identity, race, poverty, and migration
in a multicultural, global society.
Most of the 2007 event driven websites, news articles, publications, education resources, and
online exhibitions or those created just prior to 2007 or just after, which are meant to be long term
resources on these issues, have been organised into a web collection on the Internet archive (IA). This
paper aims to provide a critical look at online exhibitions versus online collections in the context of the
2007 bicentenary, specifically comparing the effectiveness of websites called "online exhibitions" from
a user perspective with websites called "educational resources," in this IA collection. In addition to
defining and providing examples of "collections" or "exhibitions" this paper attempts to explore ideas
for the types of institutional and shared material that lend themselves to creating either an online exhibition
or an online education resource.
Keywords: Online exhibitions, Internet archives web collection, 2007 bicentenary slave trade, slavery websites,
British empire, British heritage.

1. INTRODUCTION
"Commemorative events tend to reveal more
about the people engaged in remembering than the
event being commemorated."
Asif Kahn 1
In 1807, an Act passed by parliament outlawed
the British slave trade. While this was not the end
of slavery, or even the end of slavery in the British
empire, this act was an important step after decades
of anti-slavery campaigning against this brutal, lucrative
practice. In a historically strange and ironic twist,
Great Britain was to go from being the world's largest
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(4)

commercial slave trading nation to the world's advocate
for abolition using strong arm diplomacy and its
navel fleet to bully other western nations into “sweeping
the seas of the atrocious commerce” 2 .
Two hundred years later, British heritage and
educational institutions, the government sector, and
other institutions decided to use this anniversary to
look at the legacy of the slave trade. In the popular
press, on professional listservs, on websites,
commemoration stories, programmes and exhibitions
were ubiquitous and seemed to indicate the 2007
Bicentenary was a uniformly coordinated effort 3. However,
it was in fact a grassroots, organic idea that spread
63

from institution to institution, council to council, and
region to region4. Sometimes with the help of government
grants and heritage funding, sometimes by sheer
effort of individual or group initiative imaginative,
moving, and provocative online projects have emerged.
This anniversary also provided an opportunity to address
contemporary issues related to identity, race, poverty,
and migration because of their contemporary significance
in a multicultural, global society.
Most of these websites are event driven by the
2007 anniversary, but others were created just prior
to 2007 or just after, and are meant to be long term
resources on contemporary issues. All websites discussed
in this paper are part of a web collection called
British Slave Trade Legacies which can be found on
http://archive-it.org/files/slavery-exhibit/. The URLs
given throughout this text were last accessed on 19
May 2008.

2. BACKGROUND
The British Slave Trade collection is hosted at
the Internet Archive (IA) data centre and was created
using IA's service "Archive-It". As a founding member
of the International Internet Preservation Consortium,
the IA's mission is to archive the entire web, building
a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural
artefacts in digital form, freely accessible to researchers,
historians, scholars, and the general public. The
British Slave Trade Legacies collection is subtitled
"Technology Intersecting Culture" because it records
use of internet technology as the communication
medium to examine slavery's global impact as well
as how participation in the trade affected local communities
past and present 5. Two subsections of this collection
(Fig. 1) will be reviewed. Both are listed under the
"View Collection by type of Work Created Category",
namely the "Online Exhibitions List" and the "Education

Figure 1. Screenshot of IA collection 866.
Note: This webpage can be found at http://archive-it.org/files/slavery-exhibit, then selecting

or "Education Resource." The list of websites here is examined in this paper.

Resources List." This paper will compare the best
features of 39 websites listed in these two categories
from a user perspective, listing strengths and weaknesses,
and then explore ideas for the types of institutional
and shared material lend to create either an exhibition
or education resource. This paper only examines
archived websites within this persistent URL, therefore
readers should be able to access sites being referred
to in this article should live versions of these websites
not be available.

3. IMPORTANT WEBSITE FEATURES
There are three ways for websites to have a
unified look: by motif, by colour scheme, or by
metaphor. For example, the masthead at the top
of the page may have a sophisticated graphical logo
whose style and colour repeats on subsequent pages,
branding the organisation that created it 6 . Or as a
metaphor example, an online exhibition may be entitled
the "Faces of Leadership: the Directors of JPL" and
the website will have sidebars that look like a segment
of polyester film or have other visuals like a director's
chair from a movie studio set 7. Another important
feature is clear site navigation enabling users to
move around a website with ease. It can be confusing
if the menu bar changes radically from page to
page, with no clear logic, or the means of navigation
in one area are buttons but in another area links 8 .
Not any original material kept in museums, archives
or library special collections will be suitable or
automatically provide enough inspiration to make a
good online exhibition. Much depends on the creativity
and intuition of website designer as well as understanding
of audience s/he is serving. Fortunately, the webpages
under review are all visually unified and have intuitive
navigation and load quickly (first column of
Table 1 and Table 2).
Minor navigation problems with exhibitions and
online resources that are part of larger institutional
websites are noticeable on a couple of websites.
For instance, The Story of Juba Royton on Manchester
City Council website (http://www.manchester.gov.uk/
site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=3359)
and the Quakers and the Path to Abolition in Britain
and the Colonies on Library of the Religious Society
of Friends' website (Fig. 2 showing the Quaker's
exhibition available at http://www.quaker.org.uk/Templates/
Internal.asp?NodeID=93433). Both of these exhibitions
have navigation links below the exhibition text. The
navigation bar on the left side belongs to the parent
organisation and users could inadvertently click outside
the exhibition space. Although it seems that returning
to the exhibition will not be that problematic, in an
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(4)

ideal situation if time and resources allow it, an
exhibition should be separate from the institutional
website. To make an analogy with the physical world,
imagine being in a museum exhibition or art gallery
exhibition, and then accidentally stumbling into a
staff office. Even if the office is something like visitor
services meant to assist guests, this accidental
jump breaks the continuity and pace of the exhibition
experience.

4. DEFINING EXHIBITIONS
With the similar topic of slavery, one may expect
some similarities between the nearly 40 websites
that define themselves as online exhibitions or educational
resources in Table 1 and Table 2. However, quite
a range of websites were created from the very
simple vertical scroll structure such as Cardiff University's
Abolition of the Slavery Act of 1807: Key Rare Texts
(http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/libraries/scolar/digital/
slavery.html) and Oxford University's Am I not a Man
and Brother? (http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/
projects/abolition/) to dynamic, highly visual resources
such as the Equiano Project by the Equiano Society
and Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery (http://
www.equiano.org/); and Parliament and the British
Slave Trade 1600-1807 by UK Parliament and the
24 Hour Museum (http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/
slavetrade/index.html ).
It is clear that many institutions had different
reasons and resources for creating these websites.
Some institutions used this opportunity to raise
awareness of their extensive collections, and some
organisations had less than one per cent of their
total collection related to this topic, but used this
opportunity of explore their collection and take part
in this national anniversary9. Users can also compare
the different strands of political language and the
presence of the politics of new display, especially
for websites generated with British Black community
input. For example, the slogan of the International
Slavery Museum is “Remember not that we were
freed, but that we fought” (http://www.liverpoolmuseums.
org.uk/ism/). This is an empowering message, and
demonstrates that the contemporary Black British
perspective of this history is that slaves actively
took part in their own emancipation, and that resistance
to slavery took place in many forms. Abolitionist
propaganda written prior to the passage of the 1807
Act was generated for the purpose of passing specific
legislation, and therefore addressed to the contemporary
peers of Abolitionists in order to mobilize the white,
propertied class to social and political action. Historical
abolitionist documents frequently use evangelical
terminology that implies that abolitionists and their

supporters were the saviours of Africans. Merely
displaying material from a specific time period repeats
and intensifies the beliefs from that time period 10 .
Exhibitions that now only highlight the role of the
abolitionists without also considering the role that
the slaves themselves have played are considered
by critics to be at best an incomplete discussion
of the bigger picture, at worse ignorant, insensitive
and racist.

Belcher says an exhibition is "to show for a
purpose" 11 . When heritage institutions put digitised
images of their collections online as part of a website,
although that institution may call something an "exhibition,"
it may not necessarily be so. Kalfatovic says that
in order to truly have an online exhibition several
things are all necessary: a tight connection between
a central idea, a selection of objects or documents
to make this point, and a script 12 . Of the 18 online

exhibitions (Table1) according to this definition of
exhibition, two self identified exhibitions are not
exhibitions: Celebrating the Black Presence i s a
collection of images, and at the time of this writing,
London, Sugar and Slavery is a webpage, promising
that an online exhibition will be up soon.
Kalfatovic also defines five different types of
websites which elicit a range of emotions and reaction
from viewers. Depending on the response a designer
is trying to evoke from the user, the designer will
chose one or a combination of these overall styles:
68

Ë

Aesthetic : organised around the beauty of an
object

Ë

Emotive : designed to illicit an emotion in the
viewer

Ë

Evocative : designed to create an atmosphere

Ë

Didactic : constructed to teach about something
specific

Ë

Entertaining : presented just for fun 1 3

Figure 3. Screenshot of a visually striking exhibition.

5. SUCCESSFUL WEBSITE CRITERIA
In Table 1 and Table 2, if an exhibition or educational
resource has been labelled “visually striking,” it is
because it has succeeded overall as a design to
meet one of the first four categories. Visually striking
also takes into account the overall effective design
in practical terms as well as aesthetic terms. The
typography is legible and has appropriate margins,
colour, font-size and font style to match with material.
For instance the online exhibition Parliament and
the British Slave Trade 1600-1807 by UK Parliament
and the 24 Hour Museum (Fig. 3) uses the didactic
approach and has lovely colourful images on a blue
background which are well organized by topic and
colour scheme. Cotton Threads (http://www.cottonthreads.org.uk/) by Bury Museum and Archive is
evocative of a 17th century genteel home and the
choice of warm wood motifs transmits the sense of
English countryside living. The Equiano Project uses
an interesting mixture of black with bright colours
and serif and sans serif fonts to convey the sense
of history with contemporary relevance.
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(4)

As mentioned earlier, by having an online exhibition
in a separate web space, the designer can concentrate
on implementing the best features without having to
conform to the home institution’s style. The designer
is free, for instance to use a serif font to visually
convey historical or traditional reflection as in these
examples, even if the institutional font is sans serif
which generally conveys a contemporary outlook.
“Pragmatic meaning is embodied graphically” 14 .
There are several reoccurring themes when it
comes to overall website design: having an original
idea, making the website accessible, and choosing
appropriate subject matter 15 . Looking at this sample
of 39 websites, one can affirm they examine the
topic from unique angles. The original ideas conveyed
by many of them are based on their different institutional
collection. Some websites focus on material in
collections which reveal non-obvious connections,
like a hidden economic link, some websites focus
on the life of influential abolitionist individuals like
William Wilberforce or Olaudah Equiano.
69

A good example of an audience appropriate
online exhibition is the Museum of Childhood’s Young
Runaway Slaves (http://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/whats_on/
exhibitions/young_runaway_slaves/index.html ). It is
less graphic about the brutality of slavery, but it
does not dumb-down material either. In fact, the
website engages directly with its younger audience
by inviting them to imagine themselves as young
slaves who are trying to run away and includes a
simple child’s style drawing of a young black boy
and other period illustrations by the artist William
Hogarth.

6. DEFINING EDUCATION RESOURCES
In the British Slave Trade Legacies collection,
nearly twenty websites are listed as education resources.
Education resources seem to be much broader in
scope than exhibitions and not dependent on displaying
surrogates of original material. They can be full of
ideas, facts, and personal stories, and many here
tend to have more in-depth subject matter. The BBC
website (http://www.bbc.co.uk/abolition/) is full on
useful and interesting material, again not tied to a
specific collection, but focuses on interesting bits
of information and personal stories. The regional
BBC websites like Scotland (http://www.bbc.co.uk/
scotland/education/hist/abolition/) and Wales (http:/
/www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/slavery/) find a
way to make local connections. Interactivity is also
a reoccurring component with education resources,
especially ones that have been created by more
than one organization. Breaking the Silence (http:/
/www.antislavery.org/breakingthesilence/) was created
by Anti-Slavery International, UNESCO and the British
Council, is visually appealing, has substantial subject
depth, resources for teachers, and interactive maps.
Users even casually browsing this resource will
learn quite a lot.
Other organisations and coalitions decided to
go down the route of not only creating long-term
resources, but to establish long-term-contacts with
local communities. For instance, a partnership of
museums and galleries in Manchester created Revealing
Histories (http://www.revealinghistories.org.uk/). In
addition to online education resources, events and
lectures were schedule across Manchester before
and after 2007. In depth research was done to find
and spell out connections between the local textile
industry and raw cotton supplied by slave plantations.
This website also shows an economic history subject
expertise applied to a specific local area. "The
Slave Trade underwrote the Industrial Revolution in
Britain, which funded the establishment of the British
70

Empire," said Bernadette Lynch of the Revealing
Histories Project, which aims to draw a more diverse
and younger audience by looking at the Manchester
collections in new ways that the new audiences will
find relevant to their own lives and their own family
histories. "The history of the slave trade is not just
black history, but the story of a shared past that
shaped British society and impacts on the present”16 .

7. CONCLUSION
Exhibitions are a form of advocacy for institutions
with original material and lend themselves to virtual
display 17 . The 2007 anniversary shows that the UK
heritage sector found ways to look at their collections
creatively and using websites and online exhibitions
found different ways to tell complex stories. Although
this paper specifically looked at 39 websites, the
British Slave Trade Legacies collection has over 100
websites classified in other categories such as event
and programme notices, or news articles and it is
still growing until the end of June 2008. What this
says is that some anniversaries carry their own
momentum.
The ubiquity of all of these commemoration activities,
online as well as in the real world, suggests that
this anniversary deeply affects British consciousness,
history, and identity. Why else would so much time
be invested in these resources unless it was clear
that they would appeal to a broad audience? Historian
James Walvin writes that the anti-slavery movement
provided an opportunity after the American Independence
War, to restore the British belief in themselves that
they, "above others, were a people wedded to liberty”18 .
The British were the first to provide legislation to
free slaves, and that is still a point of national pride,
although not without its complexities and darker
histories, as these anniversary exhibitions and educational
resources suggest.
As with all websites, whether they are exhibitions,
resources, online booklets, the best indicator of
what to use is to decide initially who the audience
will be, what type of emotional or intellectual response
you would like them to achieve, the level of engagement
with the website, and the time and resources available
to do it. Some projects were obviously well funded
by the British Heritage Lottery Fund or other granting
organisations, while some were mounted without
any external funding to appeal to regional, local and
institutional audiences. Looking at event driven
commemoration websites reveals both history and
historiography-built by a merger of cultural experience
with those bits of code 19 .
