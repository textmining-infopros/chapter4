ABSTRACT
This paper is an attempt to study the issues like use of electronic information resources, its impact on
the collection of print and electronic journals its awareness among the users, and the places where the users
are accessing these resources. A survey was conducted in the academic year 2006-07 at the Thapar University,
Patiala. A total number of 504 users from the undergraduate, postgraduate, research scholar and faculty
members were selected and their response was obtained with the help of questionnaire. The findings show
that users from all these categories were using e-resources; the awareness about e-resources encourages
users to use such resources to the maximum; and the users are using computer centre and hostels more
for accessing the information. The impact of e-resources was visible from the decrease in number of printed
journals in comparison to the increase in number of electronic journals. The use of e-journals has increased
manifold. The printed material is being quickly replaced by the electronic resources.
Keywords: Case study, electronic journals, electronic information resources, usage of e-resources, printed journals

1. INTRODUCTION
Information technology has thrown a new challenge
to the libraries. The technology has shown a great impact
on the services of the libraries. The access to information
through Internet has changed the role of libraries.
Libraries now have both printed document as well as
electronic information resources in their collection. The
electronic documents can be stored, accessed, and
delivered as and when required, therefore the services of
the libraries are not confined within the four walls but are
integrated into local, regional, national, and international
networks. Academic libraries too are now becoming
hybrid libraries.

2. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
The survey regarding use of electronic resources has
been carried out in many studies. The e-mail, web
browsing, and word processing are still the main
activities. Information searching is about 15 per cent only
of all the usage of electronic resources. Students feel
more at ease using online (web- based) resources than

CD-ROM databases. According to Cramford and Daye1,
students find CD-ROMs less user friendly with a less
intuitive interface; only 18 per cent used CD ROMs and 13
per cent used online databases. Since the libraries have
started subscribing to e-journals there is an increase in
the use of e-journals and decrease in the use of print
journals by faculty and graduate students. The numbers
of e-journals in the libraries have increased from two
hundred to more than three thousand2. The radical
changes in information seeking behaviour and use of
information resources are taking place as the scholars
and researchers have become more comfortable and
familiar with the resources available through web3. A major
survey of literature was carried out by Tenopir4 (2003). He
analysed the results of over 200 studies of the use of
electronic resources in libraries published between 1995
and 2003. Major finding of these studies indicate that
electronic resources have been rapidly adopted in
academic areas but the behaviour of users varies
according to their discipline. Key study in this field is by
Bar-llan and Fink5 (2005). Some of the findings of their
study are that the usage of electronic journals increases
67

with time and the variables such as age and/or academic
position is inversely related to the use of electronic format
and journals. There is a decrease in the use of printed
journals as users prefer to use the electronic format more.
As the time passes many users access the electronic
format more frequently. Dadzie6 found that the use of
computer for searching information was high. The usage
of some Internet resources was also found to be very high,
while the use of scholarly database resources was quite
low due to inadequate information about the existence of
these library resources.
The results of the study show that 68.8 per cent of
the respondents preferred to use journals online
compared to 31.2 per cent who preferred to use print
journals and 71.8 per cent who preferred to use printed
books as compared to 28.27 per cent who preferred to
use electronics books. Razaand, M-Masoom and
Upadhay carried out a survey at Aligarh Muslim University
to study the usage of e-journals by researchers. They
found that many research scholars are consulting ejournals from their departmental labs and computer
centres use e-journals not only for research purposes but
also to update their own knowledge.
These days due to increase of subscription of ejournals, every institute is reducing subscription of printed
journals. To know the awareness and usage of e-journals
among the students and faculty a survey was conducted
by Verma, Rama and Baljinder8 in the year 2005-06 in four
prestigious institutes of Engineering and Technology of
India. Questionnaire method was used to study the usage
and awareness. The result demonstrates that an
academic library can become user centered in the
electronic environment. The information provided on
consortia will expand access to electronic databases. It
was found that users are accepting electronic information
resources. The problems faced by them are lack of
training and slow downloading.

3. PROFILE OF THE THAPAR UNIVERSITY
The university, known as Thapar Technology Campus
(TTC), is spread over an area of 250 acres with its campus
in the historic city of Patiala. The Thapar Institute of
Engineering and Technology was established in 1956
through an imaginative collaboration between the then
state of Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU),
the Central Government and the Patiala Technical
Education Trust (PTET) founded by the great man of
Indian industry, the Late Lala Karam Chand Thapar.
Thapar University was granted full autonomy and the
status of a Deemed University in 1985. It now enjoys the
status of a full-fledged University. Various undergraduate
(BE, BTech), postgraduate (ME, MSc, MTech, MBA) and
Doctor of Philosophy programmes are being run by the
university.

3.1 Central Library
The library was set up at the time of establishment of
the institute. It has good collection of printed and
electronic documents. Its collection includes 50,000
printed volumes including books, text books, standards,
theses, and dissertations. Open access system is
followed for shelving of the collections. Library is fully
computerised. The users can access a large number of
online and CD-ROM-based electronic resources like
bibliographic databases and electronic journals. Theses
and dissertations submitted to the institute in electronic
format since 2003 are also available for use. Users can
access the databases at the Thapar University Library
home page (http://cl.thapar.edu/).
Central Library is also a member of Information and
Library Network (INFLIBNET), a UGC Inter-University
Centre. The Centre is involved in library automation,
database development, resource sharing, and networking
of libraries. It subscribes to several bibliographic
databases which can be used by the member Libraries
free of charge. INFLIBNET provides access to Online
Computer Library Centre Inc. (OCLC). Bibliographic
databases available in this service include: Applied
Science and Technology Abstracts, Environmental
Sciences and Pollution Management with abstracts, and
INSPEC
(Physics,
Electrical,
Electronics
and
Communication Engineering). Also, UGC-Infonet provides
online access to scholarly e-journals. The library became
member of INDEST consortium in 2005 and subscribes to
e-journals such as American Society of Civil Engineers
(ASCE) and IEEE/IEE Publications (IEL online).

4. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The specific objectives of the proposed study were:
(i)

To know the use and awareness of electronic
information resources among the users.

(ii) To know how frequently the users are using
electronic resources provided by their library.
(iii) Which place is used more for accessing the
electronic information?
(iv) To know the impact of usage on the collection of print
journals as well as electronic journal.

5. SCOPE OF THE STUDY
The proposed study will help other technical institute
to see how electronic journals are being used and to
understand the need of electronic resources in the larger
interest of the faculty members and research scholars.
The study covers the undergraduates, postgraduates,
research scholars and faculty of the Thapar University
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(2)

Patiala. The present study will be beneficial for other
institutes and motivate them to implement these
resources in their libraries also.

6. METHODOLOGY AND DATA COLLECTION
There are various methods of data collection for
profiling data including questionnaire, interview,
transaction log, and citation study. Each method is
having its strengths and weakness. In this survey
questionnaire method was used for collecting the
primary data. For the purpose of this study, secondary
data and information have been collected from the library
records, annual reports, and downloaded usage data of
electronic resources from the INDEST Headquarter at
IIT, Delhi. The survey was conducted during the
academic year 2006-07. For this purpose a
questionnaire
was
distributed
personally
to
undergraduate, postgraduate, research scholars and
faculty members of the Thapar University. Table 1 shows
the total strength (2506) at the time of survey. The 20 per
cent strength (504) has been considered for the survey.
The strength includes 1741 undergraduates, 505
postgraduates, 141 research scholars, and 119 faculty
members. The questionnaires were given to the users at
the library, departments, hostels and computer centre.
Three hundred and forty eight questionnaires were
distributed to undergraduate and their feedbacks were
100 per cent. Ninety out of 101 postgraduate students,

and 20 research scholars out of 28 responded. The
response from the faculty was 100 per cent.

7. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
The collected data was analysed by percentage;
qualities variables were found by Chi-square test and
contingency coefficient for statistically significant among
the users. The statistical package for social sciences
(SPSS) was used. The results were statistically
significant at 0.01 percent level, i.e., P< 0.01.
In response to the question, “Are you aware of
electronic information resources/services provided by
your
library?”
Sixty-seven
(19.25
per
cent)
undergraduates, 63 (70 per cent) postgraduates, 26
(96.30 per cent) faculty members, and 20(100 per cent)
research scholars answered this question in positive
(Table 2). In other words faculty members and research
scholars are more aware of their library e-resources than
undergraduates and postgraduates. From 485
respondents, only 176 (36.29 per cent) were having
awareness about this service. The value of ρ2 is 165.088
and the degree of freedom (df) is 3. The value of ρ2 is
statistically significant at 0.01 levels. There is a
significant variation among the users as far as the
awareness about library e-resources/services is
concerned.

resources, while among the faculty most of the
respondents, i.e., 20 (95.24 per cent) were using ejournals from UGC Infonet. It has been found that the
postgraduates and faculty members were using ejournals to the maximum as compared to undergraduates
and research scholars. One hundred and fifteen
respondents gave their response to the question, where
as 370 (76.29 per cent) gave no response to the question.
Sixty four (55.65 per cent) users were using e-journals.
The Chi-square test implies that there is a significant
variation among the users so far as the use of library eresources/services is concerned.

The Thapar University library subscribes to various ejournals/portals for their users under UGC-Infonet
consortium. Table 3 shows that 82 (91.11 per cent)
postgraduates were aware of UGC Infonet followed by 21
(77.78 per cent) faculty and 12 (3.45 per cent)
undergraduates while none of the research scholars was
aware of such a consortium. Out of total of 485
respondents 115 (23.71 per cent) were aware of UGCInfonet. The Chi-square test of independence is significant
at 1 per cent level of significance. This implies that there
is a significant variation among the users as far as the
awareness of UGC-Infonet consortium is concerned.
Table 4 highlights the response of the respondents
whether they were aware about the electronic resources
in library and were using them. Table 4 indicates that only
one undergraduate (8.33 per cent) was using e-journals
and a major proportion of respondents, i.e., 11 (91.67 per
cent) were not using them. Similarly, from the
postgraduate category the response of 43 (52.44 per
cent) respondents was yes and that of 39 (47.56 per cent)
was no. However, research scholars did not use such e-

The users were asked how frequently they used the
electronic journals. Table 5 shows that very few users
used e-journals daily and once in a week. The e-journals
were used maximum by users occasionally, or two to
three times a week. Undergraduate and postgraduate
students were the least users of e-journals compared to
research scholars and faculty. Out of 485 respondents
372 (76.70 per cent) did not answer to this question,

whereas 8 (7.08 per cent) used e-journals daily, 10 (8.85
per cent) once a week, 34 (30.09 per cent) two to three
times a week, and 61 (53.98 per cent) occasionally. Thus,
maximum number of users used e-journals occasionally.
The data reveals that 3 (37.50 per cent) undergraduates
each used e-journals daily and occasionally, 52 (86.67
per cent) postgraduates used e-journals occasionally
which was more as compared to 15 (75 per cent) research
scholars who used it two to three times a week, and 14
(56 per cent) faculty members used e-journals two to
three times a week. The value of ρ2 is 86.762 and the
degree of freedom (df) is 3. The value of p shows
statistically significant (P<9.01). The variation among the
users has been found as far as the frequency of using eresources is concerned. The e-resources and services
provided by the library can be accessed at various places
within the institute. The users can access the services
from their respective departments, library, hostel and
computer centre.
Table 6 shows that all the research scholars and
faculty members accessed e-resources from their
respective departments, where as in the case of
postgraduates and undergraduates this proportion was
quite lesser, i.e., 30 per cent and 1.15 per cent,
respectively. The library is used very less as compared to
other places for accessing e-resources. The faculty
members do not use library at all for accessing eresources, whereas most of the research scholars (95.56
per cent) use the library for accessing e-resources which
is maximum as compared to undergraduates (0.57 per
cent) and postgraduates (4.44 per cent). The computer
centre is used more by 308 (88.51 per cent)
undergraduate, 81 (90 per cent) postgraduates, 4 (20 per
cent) research scholars, and 5 (18.52 per cent) faculty
members. The whole data, when taken up comparatively,
provide that computer centre and hostels were being used
maximum by users for accessing e-resources.
Table 7 shows that during the years 2001 to 2007
there is a decrease in the number of print journals and
increase in e-journals at the Thapar Institute of

Engineering and Technology. In year 2001-02 there were
157 print journals. By then e-journals were not introduced
in the library. The data shows that in the year 2002-03, 82
free electronic journals were available whereas the
number of print journals came down from 157 in 2001-02
to 150 in 2002-03. A similar trend can be seen in the year
2003-04 when the number of free e-journals increased to
580 and that of print journals decreased to 138. Similarly,
in the year 2004-05, 134 print journals and 3602 electronic
journals were made available in the library including both
free and paid journals. In 2005-06, the number of print
journals further reduced to 111 and that of e-journals
further increased to 3843. However, there was no change
in the number of print as well as e-journals during the year
2006-07, establishing the fact that demand of e-journals
has substantially increased during the years 2001-07.
The library of the Thapar University introduced
electronic resources and services in 2002 with 82 (free) eresources. The number increased to 580 (free) in the year
2003. It shows that users started using these resources.
Table 8 shows the download usage statistics for the two
years, i.e., 2004 and 2005. The status of usage indicates
that there were some e-resources which were not used in
the year 2004 but the same were used in 2005. On
comparing the usage for two years, the total usage of the
e-resources shows that there was increase in the usage
from the previous year, i.e., the overall total download
usage in 2004 was 8062 and 8711 in the year 2005. The ejournals and bibliographic databases whose usage has
decreased are Institute of Physics Publishing (IOPP),
American Chemical society (ACS), Biological Abstract
database, Cambridge University Press (CUP), Science,
and Kluwer and Springer journals. Many new e-resources
were added to the collection in the year 2005, this may be
one of the reasons for decrease in the usage of already
subscribed e-journals.
The e-resources whose usage has been increased
are American Physical Society, American Physical
Institute of Physics, Oxford University Press (OUP),
Science Direct, and Blackwell Publishing.

8. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The response of respondents with regard to
awareness about e-resources and services of library
shows that only 36.29 per cent were not aware of it.
Users-wise, faculty, research scholars and postgraduates

were more aware of their library e-resources and services
as compared to undergraduates. The library should
provide orientation workshop and ongoing seminars for
students to guide them how to use electronic resources in
order to extract maximum value from these resources.
In response to the question whether they have heard
the name UGC-Infonet consortium, it was found that only
23.71 per cent respondents knew about UGC-Infonet.
Users-wise results show that faculty and postgraduates
were more aware of it as compared to the others. Among
the users who were aware of UGC-Infonet consortium,
only 55.65 per cent were using these e-resources. The
maximum users (53.98 per cent) were using e-journals
occasionally. The library should involve university
academic departments in the selection of resources so
that the required journals can be identified.
Most of the users use hostel and computer centre as
place for accessing electronic information than library and
departments. The e-journals were used by faculty and

research scholars more in the departments. Further, it
has been found that the awareness about e-resources
has encouraged the users to use these to maximum. The
impact of e-journals shows that there is an increase in the
collection and usage of e-journals. The librarian must find
out the reasons for those e-journals whose usage has
decreased. Feedback can be taken from faculty and
research scholars and from their respective departments
so that their need can be find out.

9. CONCLUSION
The findings show that a large number of users have
started using electronic journals. The impact of eresources is visible the way the there is a decrease in the
collection of print journals. The users access e-resources
more from the hostels and computer centre as compared
to the library. The use of library has decreased because
information is easily available to the users through
Internet and Intranet connectivity provided in the institute.
The use of e-journals though increased, but the users still
use these occasionally. The decrease in the collection of
print journals and increase in the e-journals indicates that
the Thapar University library is making all its efforts to
provide the benefits of e-resources and services to its
users.
