1. INTRODUCTION
Development is a continuous process. Each new
development of larger social relevance brings new
opportunities to the respective field. The field of
education has no exception to this. To provide and get
education is one of the characteristics that differentiate
human beings from other living things. And for better
education human beings are continuously improving their
teaching-learning tools and techniques. Each revolution of
the human society had its impact on education. The
developments in information and communication
technology (ICT) have brought psychological, sociological
as well as technological changes in the field of education.
The present boon of ICT has its own very special impact on
education. This impact of ICT is noticeable in formal and
informal education, traditional and professional education
as well as at all levels of education. The most recent
influence of the ICT in the field of education is recognised
as e-learning. E-learning has many other nomenclatures
such as computer assisted instruction, computer-based
training, online education, web-based training, etc. Elearning is there for quite some time now1. It has brought
new opportunities to education in all subjects, including
library and information science (LIS). This paper describes
e-learning, its suitability to LIS education, and on-going
initiatives in applying e-learning in LIS education.

2. WHAT IS E-LEARNING?
E-learning is learning enabled by the electronic
media. It is a learning facilitated by the application of
ICT. E-learning is a process of education using
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

computer, telecommunication, networks, and storage
technology. According to CISCO’s definition quoted by
Jeevan2, e-learning is the over reaching umbrella that
encompasses education, information, communication,
and training. It is the web-enabled system that makes
information and knowledge accessible to those who
need it, when they need it—anytime, anywhere. In the
present context it is a web-based learning. To put it in a
more pedagogical frame, e-learning has the following
characteristics.
Remote Learner-Teacher: In the e-learning environment,
the learner and the teacher need not to travel to a
common physical location for the purpose of education.
They can be away from each other, yet achieving the
goal of education through technological means.
Learner Centered: E-learning can be personalised
to the learner, or as it is called customised to the
needs of the learner. Unlike the classroom-based
learning the e-learner can choose his/her learning module.
Course Material: The teacher (aptly called as facilitator)
and or his institution prepares course material. This
includes curriculum, courseware, assignments, glossaries,
citations to other online and offline resources, quiz,
lecture presentations, examination questions, etc.
The course material is made available in the electronic
format; most of the time online. The course material
is made interactive by inbuilt exercises, simulations
etc. It is made more understandable by the use of
animation. Being in electronic format the course material
can be updated quickly.
37

Multimedia Nature: The course material being in
electronic format can be in textual, audio or video
format. A typical course material can combine all
these features.
E-communication: All notices, announcements regarding
admission, submission, examination, results, etc.
are sent through Internet/are made available on websites.
As the administrative work is carried out online it
becomes fast and accurate.
Use of Internet: Counselling/educational instructions
are provided interactively through Internet-based services
such as, blogs, chat-rooms, peer and expert discussion
groups, e-mails, etc. The online courses also provide
links to useful resources on the Internet and Intranet.
Internet empowers both the learner as well as the
instructor.
Anywhere Learning: E-learning provides remote access
to learning facilities through the ICT. As such the elearner can learn from the place of his convenience,
even from home, office, while travelling, or literally
from anywhere. In the globalised world the work style
is changing. People are expected to work from anywhere
and anytime. The e-learning suits to this philosophy.
Anytime Learning: The time is not a constraint to
the e-learner, one can learn anytime that suits his
schedule. It is truly 24x7 learning system.
Just-in-Time: The c-learning (classroom learning)
adopts the philosophy of just-in-case. So what is
taught and studied in c-learning is on the thinking
that such and such knowledge, skill may be needed
in future. On the contrary the e-learning is arranged
to develop skills, which are needed at the particular
time.
Multiple Collaborations: In e-learning there emerge
multiple collaboration, i.e., teacher-student; studentstudent, as well as teacher-teacher. Multiple collaborations
also includes collaboration between the content
development experts and the technology people.
Learner’s Active Participation: E-learning is impossible
without active participation from the learner. If the
learner does not respond to the initiatives of the
teacher the learning purpose remains unattained.
Facilitates Lifelong Learning: Being self-paced, elearning can develop skills in the e-learner which can
be useful to him for lifelong learning.

3. E-LEARNING TOOLS
Apart from the Internet, Intranet and other network
tools and techniques, the e-learning community
extensively uses the following tools:
38

Course Management Systems (CMS): CMS tools
are also known as virtual learning systems, content
management systems, learning management systems,
learning content management systems, etc. CMS
tools help in the creation, and management of course
material such as lessons/courseware, assignments,
glossaries, citations to other resources, etc. In other
words these tools help in total e-learning. Moodle,
Sloddle, Lectureshare, elementK, Blackboard, AuthorIT,
digitalTthink.com IndiaWebDevelopers, E-learning Solution
are some of the course management tools. Each one
of them has its own specialty. In order to have some
uniformity in various CMS a set of specifications
known as SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference
Model) has evolved. Most CMS are free and open
source, so that they can be downloaded free and can
be customised to once own needs.
Blogs: A blog enables to disseminate and access
specific information. Apart from blogs devoted to LIS,
the websites of departments of library and information
science have blog facility. Blogs can be used by
students as well as by instructors to provide updated
information. They are useful to initiate discussions.
Wikis: Wikis is a piece of software where individuals
under the control of an editorial board, can upload
contents or modify existing contents. Wikis is a
useful source for getting information and extensive
links to information. For example, LITA (Library and
Information Technology Association) offers blogs and
wikis for the LIS e-learners. Wikipedia and Knol are
other examples of wikis.
E-mails: E-mails as well as e-mail-based discussion
forums such as LIS-forum are useful in delivering
contents as well as communications about e-learning.
Messenger: Messenger such as Yahoo Messenger,
MSN Messenger can be used for synchronous interaction.
Facilities like eZmeeting can also be used for realtime conferencing. The ACRL, for example, has live
chat series called OnPoint. Using this tool the ACRL
organises e-learning events for various occasions.
E-learning 2.0: It refers to new ways of thinking
about e-learning. It is inspired by the emergence of
Web 2.0. It emphases on use of social learning, and
tools such as blogs, wikis, podcasts, and virtual
world such as second life. According to Craig 3 new
generation learners are influenced by social networking.
Experienced and empowered to create, publish, and
redistribute contents, they find the structure of LCMS
traditional and inflexible in contrast with the usercentered approach of web 2.0 services. Case studies 4
indicate that LIS schools are making changes in
curriculum and teaching-learning methods using more
and more Web 2.0 technologies.

4. TRADITIONAL LIS EDUCATION VERSUS
E-LEARNING
With the tremendous benefits and increasing
success of e-learning, it is but natural to ask the
question, can e-learning render the traditional LIS
education obsolete? However, thinking rationally, one
has to answer negatively to this question. The traditional
LIS education provides a strong knowledge base to the
potential professional. It develops in him the most basic
library management skill—cataloguing, classification,
indexing—broadly referred to as knowledge organisation
skills. The traditional LIS education also fulfills one of
the basic objectives of education, i.e., to develop an
attitude for the profession. To get all theses advantages
the traditional LIS education is a must and should be of
minimum two years duration.
Does this means that e-learning is not suitable for
imparting LIS education! This is also not true. E-learning
has its own advantages. The experience of Mutula et al.6
confirms that the e-learning even proves more beneficial
than face-to-face learning. E-learning’s effectiveness in
LIS is proved by Forrest7.

5. SUITABILITY OF E-LEARNING FOR LIS
EDUCATION
E-learning should be adopted in LIS education for
the following reasons:

5.1 Management of Change
Like most other institutions libraries are also facing
dramatic changes in its dimensions. Particularly, the
growing use of ICT in library activities is enforcing many
changes. However, the staff working for many years in
libraries may not be well-convergent with the ICT. The
reason could be the emergence of ICT long after they
had their education. The ICT terms like metadata,
thesaurus construction, ontology, taxonomy, electronic
Dewey, information literacy programmes, open source
software for library management, digital library, digital
library software, creation and maintenance of
institutional repositories, Web 2.0, Library 2.0
technologies and their use in libraries, HTML, XML,
knowledge management, web design, copyrightimplications in the digital library era, etc. might be a bit
difficult for them to comprehend. E-learning is the most
suitable teaching-learning method for imparting
education on such important and useful topics in LIS.

5.2 Modular or Cafeteria-based Learning
Most of the undergraduate courses are of three
years duration. The postgraduate courses are of two
years duration. This 3+2 years pattern of education is
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

common in LIS education also, and does not allow
studying topics which are peripheral to the core subject
of the degree. As a result, there remain some topics
which the potential LIS professional desires to study, but
not been able to do so due to the set pattern. E-learning
will certainly help to overcome this problem because it
allows creating customised learning modules as per the
need of the learner.

5.3 Increased Expectations from the
Employers as well as Users
All potential library employers expect that the LIS
professionals must have optimum skills and thereby
efficiency in their housekeeping operations. They also
expect that the library staff should be able to provide
library services effectively. The users of the library also
have similar expectations. They feel that the library staff
must answer their reference and referral queries quickly
and accurately. One common expectation of both these
stakeholders is that the LIS professional of any cadre
must have skills to use ICT to provide efficient library
services. Thus, the ICT handling skills have become an
essential qualification for the LIS professionals. These
and other similar expectations of the employers and
users of the library can be fulfilled if LIS professionals
get an opportunity to learn these skills. Due to time
constraint, in-service library professionals may not be
able to attend regular LIS courses. In such a situation,
the e-learning remains the most viable option for inservice LIS professionals.

5.4 Multi-skilled Personnel
The present employment market expects that their
potential employee must have multiple skills. The skills
required by libraries are changing. A study indicates that
library staff needs more and newer skills5. The workflow
is changing. The classroom-based, traditional pattern of
LIS education may not allow the library staff to have
multiple skills. Through e-learning they can acquire more
skills at their own pace and time.

5.5 Job-Specific Needs
The traditional LIS education, particularly in India, is
a general LIS education in the sense that the learner of
this system of education does not get specialised in
managing a specific type of library. He even does not get
special/depth education for any specific information
technology or depth education on designing tools like
ontology or a digital library. The above requirements are
environment specific, where the LIS professional is
working after having the basic LIS education through the
traditional methods. E-learning offers the opportunity to
provide education, which is job specific and will help LIS
professionals to perform to the optimum extent.
39

5.6 Image of the Profession
The e-factor (electronic factor) is an image building
factor. As such the provision of e-learning, if made
available by the LIS educational institutions will definitely
improve the image of LIS teaching profession.

5.7 More Content and Short Duration
In India library science is mostly taught as a
postgraduate course (there are some undergraduate and
certificate courses also). These courses are of one- and
or two-year duration. New subjects, aspects, facets, are
continuously emerging in LIS. The quantum of
knowledge and skills to be imparted to the upcoming
LIS professional are continuously increasing. It is
difficult to provide all this knowledge and impart all
expected skills in one or two academic duration. So the
subjects which could not be taught/studied during
regular courses can be taught through e-learning.

electronic library, and therefore more capable to provide
effective services to his e-learning users.

7. E-LEARNING INITIATIVES IN LIS
As mentioned earlier, e-learning is more suitable for
short-term, specialised courses in LIS. This is confirmed
by the following e-learning initiatives in LIS undertaken in
recent times:


ACRL (Association of College and Research
Libraries): ACRL has developed e-learning courses
of three weeks duration. The topics include creating
plan for information literacy, designing websites for
libraries, teaching portfolios for librarians, and virtual
reference competencies. ACRL even has e-learning
courses of 1 and 2 hr duration on topics such as
technology trends in academic libraries.



Click University: The e-learning programme of
Special Libraries Association is known as Click
University. Presently, it is offering e-learning
courses of 15 days duration on knowledge
management.



YALSA (Young Adult Library Services Association):
YALSA of ALA offers continuing education
programmes for young librarians through e-learning.



AASL (American Association of School Libraries):
AASL offers short-term e-learning courses for school
librarians. The topics include children literature, how to
create collaborative lectures, etc. These courses are
of 3 to 10 hr duration.



RUSA (Reference and User Services Association):
RUSA offers e-learning courses of 5 weeks duration
on subjects such as business reference service,
readers advisory service, reference interviews, etc.



PLA (Public Library Association): PLA has elearning programmes to solve problems in public
libraries. At present the eLearning@PLA has
announced ‘Power Tool Planners’, an e-learning
programme for librarians of public libraries.



IMARK (Information Management Resources Kit):
IMARK is a partnership-based e-learning initiative to
train individuals and support institutions and
networks worldwide in the effective management of
agricultural information. It comprises of suit of
distance leaning resources, tools, and communities
on information management.



LEAD (Library Education at Desktop): Library
Division of the Texas State Library and the
University of North Texas School of Library and
Information Science has jointly developed e-learning
courses of 1 to 2 hr duration.

5.8 Changing Learning Trends
The changing learning trends are of part-time/home
learner. To respond to these trends the LIS education
should adopt the e-learning.

5.9 Distance Education and E-learning
The distance education and e-learning share many
common features such as remote learner, course
material, emphasis on self-study, learning at once own
pace and time, etc. However, e-learning adds value to
distance learning by delivering digital course material.
The digital nature of course material brings much
flexibility to the learner.

6. THE BLENDING METHOD
In fact the blending of the traditional teaching
methods and e-learning for imparting LIS education will
be the best strategy to optimise the efficiency of the LIS
professionals. The traditional teaching methods should
be adopted to provide the basic knowledge, and to
develop skills in carrying out library housekeeping
operations, and the e-learning should be adopted for the
continuing education in LIS. According to Krishan Kumar
and Jaideep Sharma the use of blending method in LIS
education will help to retain students in the LIS
courses8.
Thus the use of e-learning in LIS education need not
be thought as a competitor to traditional LIS education.
On the contrary e-learning complements the traditional
LIS education. LIS e-learner learns by using the
electronic information sources and various ICTs. As a
result they will be in a better position to manage
electronic information sources effectively in hybrid and
40

SLA (Special Libraries Association): SLA
arranges webinars, i.e., web-based seminars for
library professionals. These e-learning programmes
are made available live through video conferencing.
Replay of the video conference is also made
available to professionals who could not attend the
live video conference.
NELINET: NELINET is a network of public,
academic and special libraries in six New England
sates. NELINET has developed customised webbased training programmes for its members.

In spite of the contention that the e-learning is more
suitable for short-term specialised courses in LIS, there
are number of universities, associations and institutions,
which are offering certificates to master level e-learning
courses in LIS. Some of them are the Indiana State
University, Mansfield University, Syracuse University,
Texas Woman’s University, University of Arizona, The
University of Illinois, University of North Texas, University
of Pittsburgh, University of Tennessee, and University of
Wisconsin. Observing this list of universities and their elearning courses one ponder whether e-learning in LIS
has come to a matured stage?

9. CONCLUSION
The world scenario of LIS education is changing
fast. The change is enforced by many forces such as
technology, demographic features, economic characters,
etc. The LIS education is responding to these changes
by making appropriate changes in its teaching-learning
strategies. Adoption of e-learning in LIS is robust
indicator of this response. The Indian LIS education too,
is slowly but steadily making progress in this direction.
Availability of proper and adequate infrastructure will add
momentum to LIS e-learning in India.

8. E-LEARNING INITIATIVES IN INDIA
The distance/open education in India is spreading
very fast. There are number of institutions offering
distance education in LIS. The institutions of distance
education are the first to adopt the e-learning in LIS. As
has been discussed earlier e-learning suits more to
distance education. Realising the importance of elearning in distance education the Indira Gandhi National
Open University (IGNOU) and various state open
universities in India are already testing its feasibility.
Even the distance education departments of traditional
universities are also working to use the e-learning for
their distance learning programmes. VidyaOnline9 is one
of such up-coming e-learning programme for the LIS
education. It is a venture of Vidysagar University.
Librarians Digital Library (LDL) developed by the DRTC
(Documentation Training and Research Centre,
Bangalore) provides digital resources to those interested
in e-learning. LIS departments from the traditional
universities in India will not be far behind to introduce
need-based, short-term e-learning courses. Gradually,
these departments may even run e-learning courses,
parallel to their traditional courses.
