ABSTRACT
This study analyses the India research output in diabetes during 1999-2008 on several parameters
including its growth, rank and global publications share, citation impact, overall share of international
collaborative papers, and share of major collaborative partners. It also analyses the characteristics of most
productive institutions, authors, and highly-cited papers. The publications output, impact and collaborative
publication share of India is also compared with China, South Korea and Brazil.
Keywords: Scientometric analysis, diabetes research, publications output

1. INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW
Diabetes mellitus is a group of chronic metabolic
conditions, all of which are characterised by elevated
blood glucose levels resulting from the body’s inability to
produce insulin or resistence to insulin action or both.
This group of conditions can be sub-divided into four
clinically distinct types. Type 1 diabetes (previously
known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset)
is characterised by lack of insulin production and requires
daily administration of insulin. It accounts for 5 per cent to
10 per cent cases of all cases of diabetes. Symptoms
include excessive excretion of urine (polyuria), thirst
(polydipsia), constant hunger, weight loss, vision
changes, and fatigue, which may occur suddenly, Type 2
diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent or adultonset) results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin.
Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 per cent of people around
the world, and is largely the result of excess body weight
and physical inactivity. Symptoms may be similar to
those of Type 1 diabetes, but are often less marked. As a
result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after
onset, once complications have already arisen. Until
recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but
it is now also occurring Gestational diabetes is
hyperglycaemia, which is first recognized during
pregnancy. Symptoms of gestational diabetes are similar
to Type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is most often
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than
reported symptoms. Fourth group is composed of other
types of diabetes caused by specific genetic defects of
beta-cell function or insulin action, diseases of the
pancreas or drugs or chemicals1-3. There are many
complications due to diabetes. Cardiovascular disease is
responsible for between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of
deaths in people with diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy can
lead to sensory loss and damage to the limbs. Diabetic
retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness and visual
disability. Diabetes is among the leading causes of
kidney failure, but its frequency varies between
populations and is also related to the severity and
duration of the disease. Diabetic foot disease, due to
changes in blood vessels and nerves, often leads to
ulceration and subsequent limb amputation4.
According to recent estimates of the International
Diabetes Federation (IDF), the number of diabetic
patients worldwide have risen sharply from 30 million in
1985 to 150 billion in 2000 and 285 million by 2010, and
comprises 6.6 per cent of the world population in age
group 20-79. However, by 2039, 435 million people (7.8
per cent of the adult population) are expected to suffer
from diabetes. Globally by 2010, four million deaths were
expected due to diabetes in 20-79 age group (6.8 per cent
of globally all-cause mortality in this age group). Diabetes
along with cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic
143

respiratory diseases accounts for 60 per cent of all
deaths worldwide. In many countries in Asia, the Middle
East, Oceania and the Caribbean, diabetes affects 12-20
per cent of the adult population. Almost 80 per cent of
diabetes deaths occur in low- and middle-income
countries. Each year around 6 million people develop
diabetes and 4 million dies every year. It is a leading
cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke,
and amputation. The countries with the largest number of
diabetic people today are India (50.8 million), China (43.2
million), USA (26.8 million), Russia (9.6 million), Brazil
(7.5 million), Germany (7.5 million), Pakistan (7.1 million),
Japan (7.1 million), and Indonesia (7.1 million). In 2010,
India was expected to have 58.7 million diabetes patients
(almost 7 per cent of its adult population), which is likely
to increase to 87 million (8.45 per cent of the adult
population) by 2030. China is expected to increase its
diabetic patients from 43.2 million at present to 62.6
million by 2030. In India, by 2010 diabetes-related deaths
were expected around 10.07 lakh people in adult age
group of 20-79 years every year, the majority of whom
being women (5.81 lakh)5. The alarming figure of diabetes
prevalence in India made the government to start a
National Diabetes Control Programme in 1987. It started
on a pilot basis in some districts of Tamil Nadu, Jammu
and Kasmir, and Karnataka IT. In 1998, India launched Rs
5000 crore pilot projects for prevention and control of
diabetes, cardio-vascular diseases and stroke in seven
states across one district each.

1.1 Diabetes Education and Research in India
At present, in India the number of doctors who can
help to solve diabetic problems (with specialisation in
endocrinologists) is staggeringly small and the education
in endocrinology is available only at super specialisation
level after postgraduate degree. There are hardly few
endocrinology seats in government medical colleges and
only few offers super specialisation in endocrinology,
including All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New
Delhi, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education &
Research, Chandigarh;Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate
Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, Banaras Hindu
University Institute of Medical Sciences, Varanasi; and
Andhra Medical College and Osmania Medical College,
Hyderabad. Other than medical colleges, one can acquire
a Diploma of National Board, from a private hospital. But
here too, the seats are limited as few hospitals such as
Apollo and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi are
authorised by the government to provide this training. In
India, a number of research institutions, hospitals and
professional bodies are involved in conducting various
training and fellowship programmes for doctors and paramedical staff in prevention and cure of diabetes. Some of
these are the WHO Collaborating Centre for Research
Education & Training in Diabetes in collaboration with
M.V. Hospital, Chennai; All India Institute of Diabetes and
144

Research College, Ahmedabad,, S.K. Diabetes
Research and Education Centre, Kolkata; Manipal
Hospital (Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology),
Mumbai University (Faculty of Medicine); All India
Institute of Medical Sciences (Department of
Endocrinology and Metabolism), New Delhi; Amrita
Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi; Madras Diabetes
Research Foundation, Coimbatore; and
Diabetes
Research Foundation and Research Society for the
Study of Diabetes in India.
In addition, a number of research institutes under
the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Council
of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR),
Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of
Science and Technology (DST), etc., are engaged in
diabetes research. In addition, several international and
foreign government funding agencies, such as WHO,
USAID, UNAIDS, the National Institutes of Health (USA),
the UK Medical Research Council, the UK Department
for International Development, International AIDS
Vaccine Initiative, Gates Foundation and the Clinton
Foundation, etc. provide financial support to diabetes
research in India from time to time. Several global
pharmaceutical companies are entering India for
research and development activities, given the large
patient pool available here.

1.2 Literature Review
A few studies have been conducted in measuring the
progress of the research in diabetes worldwide and in
Indian context in the past. Lewin6 studied world diabetes
mellitus publications during 1984-2005, using MEDLINE
database and indicated that the publication growth of
articles parallels the increase in diagnosed cases of
diabetes mellitus (both Type 1 and Type 2 together) and
the literature relating to Type 1 diabetes mellitus has
saturated, while that of Type 2 showed the increase over
time. Apoor7, et al studied author self-citation in the
diabetes literature. Krishnamoorthy et al8 studied world
diabetes literature during 1995-2004, using MEDLINE
database. Arunachalam and Gunasekaran9 analysed 837
Indian and 427 China research papers during 1990-99 and
identified major institutions, journals used, sub-fields,
international
collaboration,
etc.
Ratnakar
and
Satynarayana10 analysed 3068 Indian diabetes research
papers during 1976-2006 on the same lines. Somogyl and
Schubert11 made an interesting correlation between
national bibliometric and health indicators in diabetes.

2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this study was to analyse the
research performance of India in diabetes research in
national and global context, as reflected in its publication
output during 1999-2008. In particular, the study focuses
on the following objectives:
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)



To study the Indian research output, its growth, rank
and global publication share and impact.



To study the patterns of international collaboration.



To study the publication productivity and impact of
leading Indian institutions and authors.



To study the characteristics of Indian highly citedpapers.

3. METHODOLOGIES AND SOURCE OF DATA
This study is based on the Indian publication data in
diabetes research retrieved from the Scopus citation
database for the 10 years (1999-2008). For citations data,
three-years, two-year and one-year citations window was
used for computing average citations per paper during
1999-2006, 2007 and 2008. The search strategy on
diabetes literature was carried out using the following
keywords suggested by Arunachalam and Gunasekaran9,
Ratnakar and Satynarayana10 and Rosalind A.
Maria12.Title-Abs-Key(diabete* or niddm or iddm or mody
or mrdm or fcpd) or (Title-Abs-Key (hyperglycem* or

and Pubyear Bef 2009. For identifying literature on three
types of diabetes and for different diabetes complications,
different keywords strategies were developed. For
calculating the international collaborative papers, a
separate search strategy, which combines India’s
collaboration with 140 major countries was prepared. For
analysing institutional and author’s output, separate
search strategies were developed for generating
institutional and author outputs.

4. ANALYSIS
4.1 Publication Rank and Share of Most
Productive Countries
In overall, the global publication share (Table 1) of the
top 18 countries vary from 1.13 per cent to 29.61 per cent
during 1999-2008. United States topped the list with
global publication share of 29.61 per cent. The United
Kingdom ranked second, followed by Japan, Germany,
Italy and France (with global publication share ranging
from 4.01per cent to 8.40 per cent). China, Spain, Sweden
and the Netherlands ranked at 7th to 10th positions (with
global publication share ranging from 2.32 per cent to 2.95
per cent). The countries that ranked between 11th and 18th
positions were India, Switzerland, Turkey, Brazil, South
Korea, Poland, and Taiwan (with global publication share
ranging from 1.13 per cent to 1.92 per cent).

remained the same, i.e., 15th while for China, Brazil,
India, and South Korea global ranking has increased
from 14th to 5th, 18th to 12th, 12th to 10th and from 17th to 13th.

4.2 India’s Publications Output in Diabetes
India’s cumulative publications output comprised of
4824 papers during 1999-2008, with average number of
papers per year as 482. The annual average growth rate
of Indian publications in diabetics during the period
1999-08 was 13.71 per cent (Table 2). Compared to
India, the publications output of China, Brazil, and South
Korea during the same period consists of 7413 papers,
3235 papers, and 3069 papers, with average number of
papers per year as 741, 323 and 307 papers,
respectively. The cumulative publications output of India
increased from 1534 to 3290 papers from 1999-2003 to
2004-2008, witnessing a growth rate of 114.47 per cent.
Compared to India, the cumulative publications output of
China, Brazil, and South Korea increased from 1436 to
5983 papers, 852 to 2383 papers and 799 to 2270
papers, witnessing a growth rate of 316.64 per cent,
179.69 per cent and 184.10 per cent, as against 146.18
per cent of the world cumulative publication output during
the same period (Table 3). The average citations per
paper registered by India’s publications output in
diabetes were 4.29 during 1999-2008, compared to 3.38
for China, 6.45 for Brazil and 7.79 for South Korea. The
average citations per paper registered for India’s
cumulative publications increased from 3.99 during
1999-2003 to 4.42 during 2004-2008, similar to increase
in China from 3.23 to 3.42. In contrast, there is a
decrease in average citations per paper from 7.05 to
6.24 in case of Brazil and from 7.83 to 7.77 in case of

4.3 International Collaboration in India’s
Publication Output
The cumulative international collaborative papers in
diabetes during 1999-2008 comprised 586, which
accounts for 12.15 per cent share in the cumulative
output of India in diabetes. Compared to India, the
international collaborative papers share of China, Brazil
and South Korea in their national outputs in diabetes
during 1999-08 was 20.50 per cent, 20.83 per cent and
23.98 per cent, respectively. India witnessed a
substantial increase in its share of international
collaborative papers from 9.65 per cent during 1999-03 to
13.31 per cent during 2004-2008. Similarly, China, Brazil
and South Korea increased their publications share from
18.45 per cent, 21.20 per cent and 21.40 per cent during
1999-2003 to 20.50 per cent, 20.83 per cent and 23.98
per cent during 2004-2008 (Table 4).
Among the top 13 Indian collaborative partners,
publishing 10 and more international collaborative
papers with India in diabetes during 1999-2008, United
States tops the list by contributing 50.68 per cent
publications, followed by United Kingdom (16.72 per
cent), Canada, Australia, and Sweden (between 5.29 per

Korea and Switzerland (between 3.07 per cent to 4.61 per
cent), and France, China and Netherlands (between 2.39
per cent to 2.90 per cent). On analysing the shift in
international collaborative publications share of these
countries from 1999-2003 to 2004-2008, it was found that
the share of United States has increased by 2.72 per
cent, followed by United Kingdom by 3.39 per cent,
Canada by 1.68 per cent, Australia by 1.21 per cent,
South Korea by 3.20 per cent, Germany by 2.09 per cent,
France by 1.17 per cent, China by 0.71 per cent, the
Netherlands by 1.39 per cent and Italy by 0.04
per cent. The share of all other collaborating countries
decreased by 5.58 per cent with Sweden, followed by
0.41 per cent with Switzerland (Table 5).

4.4 Subject-wise Research Priorities in
Diabetes Research
The diabetic research output was classified under
seven broad subject areas falling under health and life
sciences as per Scopus classification, with maximum
research output (2840 papers, 58.87 per cent share)
during 1999-2008 coming from medicine, followed by
biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology (1382
papers, 28.65 per cent share), pharmacology, toxicology
and pharmaceutics (1107 papers, 22.95 per cent share),
agricultural and biological sciences (359 papers, 7.44
per cent share), chemistry (293 papers, 6.07 per cent
share), neurosciences (141 papers, 2.92 per cent
share) and immunology and microbiology (125 papers,
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

2.59 share). In terms of impact as reflected in average
citation per paper using a three-year citation window, the
maximum impact (5.63) during 1999-08 was shown by
chemistry, followed by biochemistry, genetics and
molecular biology (4.90), neurosciences (4.79),
immunology and microbiology (4.57), pharmacology,
toxicology and pharmaceutics (4.47), medicine (4.12),
and agricultural and biological sciences (4.08). Of these
seven sub-fields, the publication citation impact
increased from 3.57 to 4.38 in case of medicine and
from 4.58 to 5.04 in biochemistry, genetics and
molecular biology. During the same period, the
publication citation impact decreased from 4.81 to 4.34 in
pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics, 6.74 to
5.24 in chemistry, 4.64 to 3.86 in agricultural and
biological sciences, 6.55 to 3.97 in immunology and
microbiology, and 4.85 to 4.77 in neurosciences (Table 6).

4.5 Type of Diabetes and Diabetic
Complications
In all 1170 papers have been published on Type 2
diabetes in India during 1999-2008 (rising from 346 to 824
papers from 1999-2003 to 2004-2008), followed by 282
papers on Type 1 (rising from 115 to 167 papers), and 163
papers on gestational diabetes (rising from 61 to 102
papers) during the same period. In terms of growth in
different types of diabetes literature, the largest growth
(138.15 per cent) took place on diabetes Type 2 literature,
followed by gestational diabetes (67.2 per cent) and type
1 diabetes (45.22 per cent) from 1999-2003 to 2004-2008.

case of Brazil (from 7.05 to 6.24) and South Korea (from
7.83 to 7.77). The share of India’s international
collaborative papers in its total output in diabetes during
1999-2008 was 12.15 per cent, compared to China’s
(20.50 per cent), Brazil’s (20.83 per cent) and South
151

Korea’s (23.98 per cent). India’s share of international
collaborative papers increased from 9.65 per cent to 13.31
per cent from 1999-2003 to 2004-2008, similar to China’s
(from 18.45 per cent to 20.50 per cent) and South Korea’s
(from 21.40 per cent to 23.98 per cent), but decreased in
Brazil (from 21.20 per cent to 20.83 per cent) during
similar period. On subject-wise break-up of Indian
diabetes papers, the maximum contribution (58.87 per
cent) came from medicine, followed by biochemistry,
genetics and molecular biology (28.65 per cent),
pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics (22.95 per
cent), agricultural and biological sciences (7.44 per cent
share), chemistry (6.07 per cent), neurosciences (2.92
per cent) and immunology and microbiology (2.59) during
1999-2008.
Among the subjects contributing to diabetic
research, the maximum impact (5.63) was registered by
chemistry, followed by biochemistry, genetics and
molecular biology (4.90), neurosciences (4.79),
immunology and microbiology (4.57), pharmacology,
toxicology and pharmaceutics (4.47), medicine (4.12) and
agricultural and biological sciences (4.08). In terms of
break-up by type of diabetes, the maximum (1170 papers)
came from Type 2 diabetes, followed by type 1 (282
papers) and gestational diabetes (163 papers). Among
the diabetes complication, the maximum effect came on
heart (with 1100 papers), followed by nephropathy (649
papers), neuropathy (451 papers), brain and cerebral
circulation (377 papers), retinopathy (187 papers) and
diabetes affecting feet or foot (113 papers). The 20 most
productive institutions participating in diabetic research in
India accounted for 37.81 per cent share in total Indian
research output in diabetes and registered an average
citation impact of 5.66 and h-index of 13.45 during 19992008. Similarly the top 20 most productive scholars
participating in diabetic research in India together
accounted for 19.96 per cent share in India’s research
output, registered an average citation impact of 8.33 and
h-index of 13.20.The top 100 highly-cited papers (of which
27 involved international collaborations received citations
ranging from 45 to 266.
The authors of these highly-cited papers were
affiliated to 52 Indian institutions, including 21 papers from
All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi; 10
papers from Madras Diabetes Research Foundation,
Chennai; 6 papers each from KEM Hospital and Research
Centre, Pune and MV Hospital for Diabetes, Chennai;
etc.) and were published in 64 journals, including 11
papers in Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 7 papers in
Diabetologia, 5 papers in Diabetes Research & Clinical
Practice, etc. Compared to the share of incidence of
diabetes, the global share of Indian research output in
diabetes is very small. In addition, the quality of research
as reflected in average citation per paper is weak
152

compared to Brazil and South Korea. Similarly, the share
of international collaborative papers is small compared to
China, Brazil and South Korea. It means that funding of
research in diabetes is quiet inadequate. It is suggested
that Indian government and health establishment in the
country should look at national health policy more
critically, reorient their research priorities and help bring
more funds for research in diabetes. Further, there is need
to strengthen the existing international linkages and
create new international linkages for increasing the
research output and quality. Also within the country, there
is a need for close collaboration between clinical research
and basic science researchers in diabetes.
