ABSTRACT
Nanotechnology has generated a great deal of excitement world-wide and is being cited as the key
technology of the 21st century. Nanotechnology provides a window of opportunities for countries like India
that tends to address developmental problems and forge economic growth through technological
intervention. Emerging technology such as nanotechnology provides a level playing field as even advanced
OECD economies are developing competency in this technology. From 2001 onwards, Government of
India has given special attention to this area. The present study examines, through bibliometric and other
innovation indicators (standards, products/processes developed), the present state of development of
nanotechnology research and innovation in India. These findings are discussed in the context of China’s
activity in this field.

1. INTRODUCTION
Nanotechnology has generated a great deal of
excitement world-wide and is being cited as the key
technology of the 21st century. Nanotechnology is not a
discreet technology or an industry sector. It simply refers
to a range of technologies that operates at the nanoscale (roughly 1-100 nanometers, one nanometer is 10-9
m). Novel properties manifest at the nano scale which
make this technology so exiting. Nanotechnology is
already addressing key economic sectors, namely,
materials and manufacturing (coatings and composites
for products like automobiles and buildings), information
and communication technology (ICT) and electronics
(displays, chips, photonics, batteries), health and fitness,
food and beverages, and life sciences (pharmaceutical
applications).
Nano-applications can provide solutions in areas that
are of pressing concerns in developing and improvised
economies, i.e., environment, water purification,
agriculture, energy, and in a host of other products and
services. Nanotechnology provides a window of
opportunities for countries like India that tends to address
developmental problems and forge economic growth
through technological intervention. Emerging technology
such as nanotechnology provides a level playing field as
even leaders are also developing their competency.

From 2001 onwards, Government of India has given
special attention to this area. Nanotechnology was
launched as a mission mode programme in the Xth Five
Year Plan (2002-2007); programme termed as NSTI
(Nanoscience and Technology Initiative) with an
allocation of Rs 60 crore. In 2007, this programme was
upgraded with another major initiative known as ‘Nano
Mission’ with a budgetary allocation of Rs. 1000 crore for
5 years. These programmes intend to create necessary
innovation climate for nanotechnology in India1. At this
juncture when the mission mode programme is to
complete its period soon, it is important to evaluate as to
what extent governments stimulation has led to creation of
capacity and capability, and development of applications.
The present study attempts to evaluate the development
of this field in India using bibliometric (publication and
patents) and other innovation indicators (standards,
products/processes developed). In this paper, it is
argued that multiple applications of indicators can show
the contemporary status of nanotechnology development
in India.
Developing innovation capability/competency is an
immense challenge in nanotechnology as it is an
emergent science-based area having idiosyncratic
characteristics and complexity, requiring development of
competitive R&D infrastructure, significant R&D
investment, skilled manpower having inter-disciplinary
349

competence, access/development of sophisticated
instruments, entrepreneurship, and requiring synergy
among divergent set of stakeholders. There have been an
increasing number of studies to uncover the developing
scenario of this field using bibliometric methods. Four
major strands of research have occurred in
nanotechnology-based bibliometric studies, namely, who
is winning the nanotechnology race?; examining to what
extent the field is interdisciplinary? to what
nanotechnology is becoming path-dependent; and
whether nanoscience and nanotechnology are closely
interlinked2?. Among the influential contributions in this
area have been the works of Kostoff3, et al.; Meyer4,5, et
al.; Glanel6, et al. and Leydesdorff7. Another important
line of research has been to ‘properly’ delineate the
research field, to reduce noise and capture the research
papers and patents that define the field. This is a
challenging area of work as nanotechnology is
interdisciplinary in nature, evolving rapidly and the
contours of the field are changing very fast. Key
contributions in this area are by Noyons8, et al.; Porter9,
et al.; Kostoff10, et al.; and Mogoutov11, et al.
A drawback of the majority of bibliometric studies has
been the reluctance to capture indications from other key
indicators that can provide a more complete picture of
the contemporary status of this field. The present study
attempts to fill this gap by applying bibliometric and other
innovation indicators to capture the dynamics and
development of nanotechnology in a more informed
manner.

used for capturing publication and patent data. Indian
domestic
patents
were
captured
from
India.bigpatents.com. Publication activity provides good
indication of innovative capability in knowledge-intensive
areas as evolution is contingent on strong interaction with
scientific research. Not all products are patented and not
all patents yield products. However, patenting activity
demonstrates the inventive ability of a firm or a country
and a possible indication of creating future novel
products particularly applicable to knowledge-intense
areas such as nanotechnology. In addition, involvement
of various actors and linkages among them can be
revealed through bibliometric indicators.
For an emerging technology, the standard setting is a
key strategy as it can shape future market for domestic
firms if the technical standards created by a country are
adopted internationally. For a country with a large
domestic market, the technical standards created by it in
a particular product class can also become a useful
strategy for dominating internal market and can influence
the future adoption of that standard internationally.
Standards being developed were delineated from
metrology activity of BIS, NPL, etc. Products/processes
developed provide the final indication of a countries)/
firm(s) ability to assert in a particular technology. Indian
Business Insight Database (newspaper clipping service),
annual reports, etc. were used to capture the application
development.

3. FINDINGS

2. METHODOLOGY

3.1 Publication Analysis

The present study is based on capturing data from
varied secondary sources. Web of Sciences’ Science
Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) and data of US Patent
Office accessed from Delphion Patent Database was

From 2000-2009, India published 13,366 papers out
of which 24 per cent of the publication emerged in 2009.
Figure 1 exhibits publication activity of advanced OECD
and major emerging economies. One can note that China

has emerged as the leading country in the publishing
race. India is much behind the leaders, but is among the
top 10 countries publishing in this field. Figure 2 shows
some of the emerging Asian economies which are
developing the scientific capacity.
Figure 2 highlights the strong progress of Iran and
Singapore. Nanotechnology is frontier, highly scienceintensive area and thus publications provide a good
indication of emerging economies presence which was
earlier hegemony of only advanced OECD countries.
Nanotechnology, being an interdisciplinary area of
research, it is important to know which of the research
fields within nanotechnology, India is most active in terms
of publishing. Comparison with India’s overall
publications makes a more informed assessment as it
helps indicate to what extent India’s strength in a subject
field finds reflection in activity within nanotechnology.
Strong mismatch with overall publication profile would
show that India is not properly strategising its scientific
strength in addressing an emerging frontier research
area. Figures 3 and 4 highlight two aspects:
India’sprolific areas of research and research areas
within nanotechnology where Indian researchers exhibit
maximum activity.
Material science, physics, and chemistry are the
three dominant areas of India’s research. It is observed
that within nanotechnology, these three areas also have
strong focus. Computer science, agriculture, and
pharmacology (pharmacy) are also areas where
publication activity is increasing. These areas are also
important within nanotechnology. However, It is found
that these are not major areas of research activity within
nanotechnology field. Journals also provide an indication
of cross-fertilisation of researchers from different
research fields. India’s dominant publishing activity, as
reflected
through
journal-type,
shows
major
concentration in applied physics, material science,
chemistry and polymer science. Table 1 also shows
some of the publications are in high impact factor (IF)
journals. Among high IF journals, Indian researchers
have published 232 papers in the journal
Nanotechnology (IF-10.03), 249 papers in Journal of
Physical Chemistry C (IF-4.22), 243 papers in Physics
Review B (IF-3.47) during the period 2000-09. Table 2
highlights activity of institutions that exhibit prolific
activities in overall period 2000-09.
Institutions of prolific activity are reputed academic
institutions
and
research
laboratories
(mainly
laboratories of CSIR). Indian Institute of Science with
1004 publications during 2000-09 exhibits maximum
activity followed by IIT Khargapur (830 papers), CSIR-

institutions in 2009. Institutional linkages are developing
from sparse network (2001) towards a more connected
network in 2009. Cluster formation has strong bearing on
geographical location. This formation may be due to
sharing of sophisticated capital-intensive instruments that
are prerequisite for nanotechnology research.

3.2 Keywords Analysis
Keywords delineate each research article and
provide signal to others of the key aspects that form the
core of the said article12. In patents, classifications
provide insight of the technology class in which the
patent belongs. This is useful, but for emerging
technology where field of evolution is fast, keywords
extracted from patent title and/or abstract can provide a
more current delineation. In the present exercise, we
have extracted conceptual words from patent topics.
Table 3 highlights the prominent keywords visible in
publications and patents. Key patent terms are
metrology, i.e., measurement aspect (nm), and
nanoparticles. Nanostructured materials of different
types are gaining prominence in scientific research
papers.
Figure 6 further highlights the linkages among
keywords in scientific papers published by India in 2009.
Keywords linkage analysis provides insight to the
sophistication of research in this field. In 2000, keywords
indicated only basic level of research activity. Material
characterisation (mainly in electrical/optical properties)
was the main area of activity. Nanoparticle of titanium
oxide and formation of new particles were visible. In
2005, use of more sophisticated instruments like AFM

(atomic force microscope), FTIR (Fourier transform

spectroscopy)
were
observed.
Some
applications were also visible in drug delivery
applications, and alternate energy applications. To what
extent Indian researchers papers are attracting visibility
is examined through top 1 per cent cited papers in this
filed (Table 4).
Only 3 papers were among the top 1 per cent cited
papers in 2003, and 6 papers in 2005. In 2009, India
made its presence more visible with 26 of its papers
among the top 1 per cent cited papers in nanotechnology
(Table 5). However, wrt total output, number of Indian
researchers papers in top 1 per cent cited papers is low
in comparison to ratio of majority of active countries.
Figure 7 illustrates the top 1 per cent cited papers
that were outcome of collaborations. Among the 26
papers, 65 per cent of papers (17) were collaborative
papers. Thus, collaboration is playing an important role in
papers getting high degree of visibility. It is observed that
foreign organisations were also involved in collaborative
linkages.

Table 5 highlights the no. of citations that Indian
researchers papers have received. The above data
shows that there is an absolute increase in papers as well
as citations over the years. Citation reception is to an
extent a function of time, i.e., dates of publication. So
keeping this in contention, Indian researchers papers in
later years seem to capture attention more quickly, i.e.,
receiving citation (on an average) in a short period after
publication. More detailed analysis will however clarify
this picture further.

Science is no longer a matter of individuals. Most of
the big projects are completed in groups. Thus, it is
necessary to study collaborative intensity of authors
(Table 6).Table 6 shows that multi-authorship is the
dominant feature of Indian publication activity. As
nanotechnology research is a laboratory-intensive

activity, so it is natural to find multi-authorship pattern.
This pattern is significantly increasing from 2000
possibly implying more experimental then theoretical
research.

4. PATENTING ACTIVITY
India has shown limited patenting activity in
comparison to its publications. Thirty-five patents in the
US Patent Office and 45 domestic patents have been
granted till early half of 2010. Till 2000, patenting
activities in India was in a very nascent stage. However,
patenting activity rose from the middle half of 2005 which
is particularly visible in the applications filed. There are
1356 patent applications in nanotechnology filed till the
early half of 2010 in the Indian Patent Office. One
hundred and eighteen patents have been granted till then.
Indian institutions have been granted 56 patents with
CSIR, IIT, and Agarkar Research Institute accounting for
22, 8, and 6 patents, respectively. In application filed in
the IPO, 289 patents have been filed by Indian
institutions. CSIR and IIIT are the two prolific institutions,
filing 83 and 50 patents, respectively. Countries primarily
filing patent in India are: USA (42), Germany (6), and
Australia (5). In all, patent filing has come from 16
countries with 118 institutions being involved.The CSIR is
the key player in IPO as well as in the USPTO. Academia
is again dominating this activity; however, unlike US PTO,

firms are actively involved in the IPO. Linkages are
almost non-existent, only one linkage visible between IIT
and ICI in application filed as well as in granted.Basic
chemicals and pharmaceuticals were the main areas in
which patents were granted, each accounting for 14
patents each during the period 1998-2009. The main
areas of focus within technology classes were:
Nanopolymers, nanopharama, and nanoelectronics.

4.1 Standards and Products
Technical Committee 229 (TC229), International
Organisation for Standardisation is responsible for
developing international guidelines for nanotechnology.
In 2010, Nanotechnologies Sectional Committee, Bureau
of Indian Standards (BIS) formed four National Mirror
Working Groups adopting from ISO TC229. Presently,
two standards are at the initial testing stage: (1) National
standard on use of AFM for characterisation and
evaluation of nanomaterials, and (2) electron
microscopic characterisation of multi-wall carbon
nanotubes. The remaining two standards proposed are:
Luminescent nanomaterials and magnetic nanoparticles,
and toxicity of zinc oxide nanomaterials.

4.2 Product–Processes Developed
Table 8 highlights some of the applications that have
been developed or are being developed in these sectors.
It shows that firms have developed nanotechnologybased products in areas like textiles, medicines,
computers, energy, sports, biotechnology, and various
consumer products. Majority of the products are in
pharmaceuticals and information technology. Foreign
firms have also introduced nanotechnology- based
products in the Indian market. For example, Samsung
has launched silver nanotechnology for home appliances
in India. The technology is expected to prevent bacteria
from growing inside appliances.

4. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Strong government stimulation from 2000 onwards
towards capacity creation and liberal funding has been
instrumental in nanotechnology emerging as an active
area of research in India. Significant upward trends are
on account of increasing activity of institutions, increase
in number of institutions involved in publishing, wider set
of journals used for publication and increasing

collaborations.
Research
is
exhibiting
more
interdisciplinary characteristics (reflection through
journals) and activity within different subfields of
nanotechnology. Keyword analysis provides an
indication that sophisticated instruments is now more
accessible to researchers. India’s papers are also
attracting attention but still are much below world
standards. India’s patenting activity is still in a nascent
stage. It, however, has been found that there is increase
in patent filing both through PCT (international filing) and
Indian Patent Office. But linkages are almost nonexistent. Standardisation is very important as it defines
and regulates product/process quality. India, has only
taken initial first steps in addressing standardisation
issue. India is focusing on few key areas for
nanotechnology-based intervention. Nano-biotechnology
is one of the important areas now getting attention. India
has developed nanotechnology-based products mainly in
textiles, medicines, computers, energy, sports,
biotechnology, and various consumer products. Thus
overall India has created a reasonable scientific capacity
as visible through its research publications output. In
other aspects, it has started making tangible progress.

Nanotechnology, as a priority area of research was
articulated more or less at the same time when other
countries started their programmes influenced by US
National Nanotechnology Initiative. Comparison of
India’s progress with other countries brings to focus the
major gaps that need to be addressed. China’s
nanotechnology development provides a useful
benchmark for other emerging countries to follow13.
China is already leading the nanotechnology publishing
race. This is a strong assertion of capability when the
field is science-intensive. China’s patenting activity was
negligible earlier but has shown strong progress. This
can be seen for applications filed in the USPTO. During
2005-09, it filed 289 patents, emerging as the sixth most
active patent filing country in the USPTO. Among the
most visible changes is the emergence of Chinese
universities in the patenting activity and also joint industry
partnerships. For example, during 2005-09, Tshinghua
University emerged as the third most prolific patent filing
entity in the USPTO and had filed 256 patents with HonHai Precision, which has a nanotechnology centre in
Tsinghu University campus.
China, in 2005, became the first country to issue
national standards for nanotechnology. It has so far
created
27
nano-dimensional
material
and
characterisation standards on terminology and
nomenclature and 12 nanomaterials/product standards
of which 21 have been implemented. China’s active
involvement in standard creation and adoption is its overreaching strategy for future technology domination in this
critical field. This can be seen from its standard
developed for textile industry. The adoption of this
standard in nanotechnology-embedded textile makes the
textile more acceptable to consumers and also gives a
brand value in the global market. China’s nanotechnology
products are visible in international markets. For example
Woodrow Wilson database of nanotechnology product
inventory globally (www.nanotechproject.org) lists over
1000 consumer products in eight different application
areas. After USA, Korea, and Germany, China has the
maximum number of products in this inventory, i.e., 63
products. None of the Indian firms has any product in
this inventory. Thus, China providing learning lesson,
i.e., with strong strategic focus, it is possible to emerge
as a leading country in a frontier area of research. India
needs to become more aggressive like China to make its
presence more strongly felt in the international stage.
