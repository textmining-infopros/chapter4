ABSTRACT
Advent of computers and developments in information communication technologies have changed the
face of libraries. A significant change is seen the way information is generated, accessed, stored, and used.
However, the theological libraries have a long way to go. Automation in theological libraries is still at a formative
stage. The status of automation in theological libraries and the constraints for automating them have been
explained. The theological libraries studied are form the Goa and coastal Karnataka.
Keywords: Theological libraries, automation, internet

1. INTRODUCTION
Two major inventions that changed human life on earth
are the invention of printing machine and the introduction
of computers. Today, computers are used in every walk of
human life. There is tremendous impact of computers in
the libraries. Automation of libraries has become a
common feature. Library automation was initially
implemented in some major libraries of the country. Now
it has become common to academic libraries and a good
number of academic institutions, universities, and even
majority of colleges across India are automated. However,
the theological libraries are at a very preliminary stage of
automation. Theological libraries will have to take up the
challenges created by the technology, if they have to
make a mark in this 21st century.

2. WHAT IS LIBRARY AUTOMATION?
Automation is the process of using technology,
usually electronic, to produce goods and services. Library
automation is the use of computers for the management
of libraries. Computers and information communication
technologies are now used to carry out various tasks in
the library which were earlier carried out manually.
Routine functions in a library like acquisition of
documents, accessioning, cataloguing, circulation, etc.,
are all now carried out with the help of computers and
various library management softwares (available free of
cost or commercial ones). The library database
containing the bibliographic index is stored in the server.
Received on 18 April 2011

The users can access the library database online over
either the intranet or the internet. If a full fledge software,
an integrated library management software is used, the
entire library routines including the charging and
discharging can also be done using the software. The
automation of libraries in India is still in a slow pace and it
is mainly centered among special and academic libraries.
Other set of libraries like the public libraries are only
gradually getting automated. The case of theological
libraries will be interesting to investigate as they do not
come under the categories mentioned above.

2.1 Advantages of Automation
There are many advantages of automation in libraries:
•

Improvement in the quality, speed, and effectiveness
of library functioning

•

Relieving of professional staff from routine work

•

Libraries can reach wider users (e.g. union
catalogues)

•

Facilitation of resource sharing through networking

•

Efficient management of resources

•

More and better utilisation of resources

•

Preservation of manuscripts, incunabula and other
rare documents through digitisation
485

•

Digitisation makes the rare documents available to
scholars and researchers

3. WHAT IS A THEOLOGICAL LIBRARY?
Theological library can be defined in simple words as
a special library having collection of resources related to
the religious, philosophical, and spiritual traditions.
Wealth of material on philosophy, comparative religion
and mythology, theosophy, mysticism, etc., is found in
these libraries. It encourages the study of ancient and
modern religions and philosophy. Theological library
preserve the current documentation as well as the
historical material. These libraries play a significant role in
theological education.

4. METHODOLOGY
A research study was conducted to find out the
progress of automation amongst theological libraries. The
geographical area of the study is limited to Goa and
coastal Karnataka. All the 55 libraries were personally
visited to collect the data. Structured questionnaire was
used to collect necessary data. Personal interviews were
also conducted to collect additional information. The
number of theological libraries and their places are shown
in Table 1.

But a religion-wise analysis shows certain distinct
features. Out of the 10 libraries attached to Christian
institutions only one doesn’t have any computer. It was
revealed that, 80 per cent of the libraries attached to
Christian institutions have more than two computers. The
libraries of these institutes were found more organised
than the others.

The Christian institution libraries have 5 computers on
an average where as it is just above 1 for Islamic libraries.
Number of computers in Hindu libraries is very less. This
shows that automation processes in the libraries
attached to Christian institutes are much better as
compared the libraries of other religions. In the same way
the libraries in the state of Goa were showing little extra
pace in automation process. The reason being that the
sample from Goa contained more Christian Institute
libraries. The average number of computers available with
the theological libraries in the two states under the study
is provided in the Table 4.
Table 4. Mean number of computers in the library
(based on place of the library)

4.1 Availability of Computers
The first step in the process of automation is
acquisition of computers. The data collected from the
theological libraries show a clear picture that the process
of automation has just been initiated. Table 2 and Table 3
show that out of the 55 theological libraries under the
study 24 (43.64 %) do not have computers at all. Fifteen

libraries have one computer. In almost all these cases the
computer is not used for library-related routine works but
for other administrative activities. One can even add these
15 libraries and it altogether makes 31 libraries which is
56.36 per cent of the total sample. This clearly indicates
the slow process of automation of theological libraries.

Another interesting fact was revealed during the
analysis of the data about the availability of computers
against the age of the library. It was expected that the
libraries existing for a many years and with huge
collections will tend to go for automation processes. But it
was found that the young libraries below the age of 10
years had more number of computers. The data is
provided in Table 5.
It shows that the availability of electronic equipments
for automation is prominent with younger libraries. The
trend does not go hand in hand with the age of the library.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)

There are many reasons for this. The people who maintain
the old libraries tend to be conventional and don’t expect
the modern equipments to invade into their sane
ambience of theology education. Feeding a huge backlog
of records into the computer also may be discouraging
these libraries to go for automation. Out of the 17 libraries
which are below ten years 14 are managed by Islamic
institutions. They are all set up in the recent past and
have been organised in a manner that suits automation.

like the Koha and Newgenlib. Some libraries, especially
academic libraries, tend to use some customised made
software which the students of those institutions develop
as part of their projects. These software are also working
well. The acquisition of library management software was
analysed and the data is shown in Table 6.

An analysis of this fact against the total number of
documents in the collection is show in the Fig. 1. It shows
a gradual increase in the number of computers as the
number of documents grows in the collection.
From the above analysis it can be generalised that the
acquisition of electronic equipments for automation is
very slow in the theological libraries in Goa and coastal
Karnataka. The process of automation has been
influenced by the age of the libraries, the religion or
institutes which manage it, and the size of the collection.

4.2 Use of Integrated Library Management
Software
Another major ingredient in the automation process of
a library is the acquisition of the library management
software. There are many proprietary library management
software available along with some open source software

It was found that only a handful of libraries are using
an integrated library management software. Some of
them have created databases of the documents in Excel
and Foxpro. As many as 36 libraries were not using any
software in the library for creating a catalogue. It was
found that 4 libraries have created a list of documents in
MS Word. Some have used Excel also. Less use of
library management software is due to the fact that
majority of these libraries are not run by professionals.
Where professionals are working, they have tried to
create some sort of an index for the collection of the
library. The existing staff is not trained to use computers.
These findings lead us to the conclusion that the
automation process is in a very slow pace in the
theological libraries. They have just started using
computers.

than 50 year old. From this, it can be inferred that the
connection to the internet is a newly established feature
of the libraries.

4.3 Use of Internet
The internet and the world wide web is considered to
be the road to information. The amount of free and
authentic information it carries and the ease of access
makes it a favorite place to search information. Every one
now tends to search information on the internet, even
though the results carry a lot of unwanted information.
Resources related to theology, religion, and philosophy
are also available on the web. There are many theological
journals available free of cost on the internet as part of the
open access. Many free encyclopedias, dictionaries, and
directories are also available. Internet connection in the
library also attracts the user community to the library.

5. CONSTRAINTS IN AUTOMATION OF
THEOLOGICAL LIBRARIES
Following are the reasons for the slow pace of
automation in theological libraries:

The connection to the internet is also an essential
ingredient in the automation process. It acts as a medium
of communication. The data regarding the internet
connections in theological libraries was collected and
tabulated. The resultant analysis is shown as Table 7.

•

Theological libraries are small in their set up

•

They do not have financial resources to buy
necessary hardware and software for automation

•

They are not under pressure to improve their services

•

They do not have trained staff to handle automation

•

With their limited resources, they can neither hire
trained staff nor send the existing staff for training

•

Lack of uninterrupted power supply

•

Major part of their collection is in print form

6. CONCLUSIONS
Libraries today do not function within their four walls. They
are opening facilities for worldwide accessibility. Along
with the changing technology, users’ expectations are
rising. Theological libraries, if they want to prove their
existence in this modern age, will have to adapt to the
developments in technology. The first step is to go for
automation. These libraries have a great treasure in the
form of manuscripts on paper, palm leaf, cloth, leather, or
metal. However, good care is taken, time and environment
has its impact on them. If these valuable resources are
digitised, these can be made available for the scholars
and researcher forever.

The empirical data on the availability of internet
connectivity shows that only 19 libraries have internet
connectivity. It is found that 70 per cent of the theological
libraries attached to the Christian institutions are
connected to internet. The availability of internet
connection was analysed against the age of the library to
find whether it is a characteristic of the new generation
libraries. The data is provided as Table 8.

The analysis shows that majority of the theological
libraries where the connection to the internet is
maintained belong to the new generation libraries. As

is internet connectivity are less than 10 years old. The
rest of the libraries having internet connection are less
