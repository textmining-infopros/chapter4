ABSTRACT
The paper analyses India’s publications output in three major international multidisciplinary databases,
as indexed during 1981-2005. It reports on India’s comparative strength in world science and technology
(S&T) output, its growth and decline, its strong and weak subject areas of research, media of communication,
its collaborative profile and quality of S&T output, institutional productivity and quality, and dynamics of
Indian research at institutional and sectoral levels. The study also provides suggestions for improving
the quantity and quality of research S&T in India.
Keywords: S&T analysis, India, research, institutional productivity.

1. INTRODUCTION

2. OBJECTIVE

At the time of independence, the S&T base of
the country was small. Today, it is much wider
comprising more than 300 universities, 400 R&D
institutions, 13 institutes of national importance,
1300 in-house industrial R&D units, and number of
private and non-profitable organisations covering
several disciplines. There has been steady rise in
the government support to S&T from Rs 760.5 crore
in 1980-81 to Rs 16, 361 crore in 2005-06. Despite
its glorious record of achievements in several areas
of S&T, the pace of growth of the scientific enterprise
(particularly in terms of scientific output) in India
has been slow compared to many other countries.
Several past studies conform this finding. 1-12 There
is an urgent need to relook at this issue in the
context of recent publications data on India science.

The main objective of this study is to ascertain
India’s status in S&T research by analysing its
published research output as reported in journals.
In particular, it seeks to understand its growth and
decline in S&T research, its world share, its strong
and weak subject areas of research, media of
communication, its collaborative profile and quality
of S&T output, institutional productivity and quality,
and dynamics of Indian research at institutional
and sectoral levels. Such a study is significant in
providing the planners and policy makers quantitative
data as required for microanalysis of current trends
in S&T research and identifying thereby directions
that the country should take to move ahead in S&T
research as a global leader.

Technology. New Delhi; Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India. http:// www.psa.gov.in

institutional share in the given sub-field compares
with the country share in the same sub-field, normalised
between 1 and -1. Further, SI values above 0.5
indicate that the level of specialisation of the institution
is high, whereas values between 0.2 and 0.5 and
between -0.2 and 0.2 indicate that institutional
specialisation is above average or just average,
respectively.

3. METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCE

The publications data in SCIE Edition of Web
of Science revealed that the country had achieved
annual average growth of 2.51 per cent in S&T
during 1985-2002, 5.96 per cent during 1996-2005,
and 10.5 per cent during 2000-05. India published
13,634 papers in S&T in 1985, which rose to
28,603 in 2005 (Fig. 1, Table 1).

For studying shift in citations on time series
basis, three publications data sets, i.e., 1985-1986,
1993-1994, and 2001-2002 were used. The time
interval between the sets is eight years, and each
set comprises publications data from two contiguous
years, instead of one year, as has been the trend
in the past for conducting such type of studies. The
study examines publications period from 1985 to
2005 for studying growth trends. Besides, the study
has looked at metrics on publications from India in
SCI and SCOPUS databases for comparative analysis.

The pace of country growth in S&T research
publications is accelerating and its output is expected
to touch 38,000 papers by 2010. Despite clocking
faster publications growth rate in the later periods,
India’s world share did not show any significant
change with time. Its world share marginally improved
from 1.68 per cent to 1.77 per cent (as seen from
SCI database) and from 2.03 per cent to 2.08 per
cent (as seen from SCIE database) during 1993 to
2003 (Table 2).

The study used both absolute and relative indices
such as (i) average impact factor (IF) per paper,
(ii) average citation per paper, (iii) share of collaborative
and international collaborative papers, (iv) activity
index, and (v) composite quality index (CQI). The
CQI is an integrated measure of quality and is
derived by averaging the summation of four relative
indicators: (i) relative IF index, (ii) relative citation
index, (iii) collaborative index, and (iv) international
collaboration index. Specialisation index (SI) is a
relative indicator which measures the extent to which

India’s growth rate as computed on publications
data drawn from three different databases SCI, SCIE
and SCOPUS has been found to differ. The five
yearly average growth rate as computed on five
yearly cumulative data was 6 per cent in SCI, and
8 per cent in SCIE during 1986-90 and 1991-95. It
was 32 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively
during 1991-95 to 2001-05. SCOPUS also showed
32 per cent growth rate during the same period
(Table 3).

No. of Papers

The past scientometric studies that reported
stagnation/decline in Indian science, were based
mainly on Science Citation Index (SCI) database.
The coverage of Indian journals in the SCI database
is small, limited to select few journals, even though
India publishes more than 1500 peer-reviewed journals.
For better assessment of Indian science, SCIE Edition
of Web of Science was used. It provides wider
coverage of Indian journals and of journals from
other developing countries. Indian Science Abstracts
was deliberately not used for this study, though its
coverage of Indian journals is much wider, for the
reason that it does not provides citations on papers
published. The citations data (as on February 2004)
was used for undertaking qualitative analysis of
India’s publications output.

5. ANALYSES AND RESULTS
5.1 Broad Publications Characteristics
India published 27,810 papers from 1734 institutions
during 1985-1986; 30,992 papers during 1993-1994
from 2223 institutions; and 39,744 papers during
2001-2002 from 3443 institutions. Only 10 per cent
institutions, which comes to 181 institutions during
1985-86, 215 during 1993-94, and 310 during 20002 account for about 80 per cent of the country’s
S&T output.
It shows that majority are low productivity institutions
and high productivity research seems to be confined

to few selected institutions only. India’s S&T output
appearing in foreign journals far exceeds the output
that appeared in Indian journals. For example, output
was reported in only 26 Indian journals during 198586 out of a total of 2113 journals, 44 during 199394 out of a total of 2558 journals, and 49 during
2001-02 out of a total of 3359 journals (Table 4).
India is spreading out its research papers in
far too many journals: 2113 during 1985-86; 2558
during 1993-94; and 3359 during 2001-02, respectively.
This leads to low visibility of Indian research output
in some of the journals. The presence of Indian
papers in 90 per cent journals has been found to

be low varying (per journal) between 1 and 10 in two
publications years. Such a low visibility of Indian
papers in journals hardly helps authors to receive
high citations, even if such papers were published
in high impact journals (Table 5).

Those under the mission-oriented R&D sector
fall under the administrative and financial control of
R&D agencies/departments as well as socio-economic
ministries/departments of Central/State governments.
The institutions under the industry sector include
both private and public enterprises. Institutions classed
as others derive their funds from international, private
and non-profitable sources (Table 6).

5.2 Publications Output by S&T Sector
The institutions pursuing S&T research in India
are categorised broadly as Institutes of National
Importance (INI), Universities and Colleges, Missionoriented R&D, Industry and others. The institutions
under the universities and colleges include universities,
deemed universities, inter-university centres, general
colleges, medical colleges, and special institutions.

The universities and colleges sector institutions
contributed the largest but declining share (from
52.2 per cent to 46.6 per cent) during 1985-86 and
2001-02. In contrast, mission-oriented R&D sector
showed rise in its publications share from 28.37
per cent to 37.93 per cent, followed by INI from

17.23 per cent to 20.42 per cent, and industry from
1.78 per cent to 2.01 per cent during the corresponding
period. The universities and colleges sector is the
largest in terms of size of institutional participation
(accounting for 48-50 per cent share), followed by
mission-oriented R&D institutions (22-30 per cent),
industry (14-20 per cent), and INI (less than 1 per
cent) during 1985-86 and 2001-02 (Table 7).
Mission-oriented R&D sector showed the fastest
growth in publications output in 16 years (102.9 per
cent), followed by INI (79.8 per cent), and Industry
(72.2 per cent). The growth in universities and colleges
sector (accounting for the largest institutional
participation) showed the slowest growth (35.6 per
cent) and well below the country average growth of
51.7 per cent (Table 6).

5.3 Growth in Collaborative Research
S&T research in the country is fast emerging
as a network activity with institutions from various
sectors collaborating at national and international
level. The country witnessed significant rise in
collaborative research (from 1700 to 14,104 papers
during 1985-86 and 2001-02). Collaborative share of
the country output rose from 7.34 per cent to 45.10
per cent during the corresponding period. Among
the sectors, collaborative share was (14.8 per cent
during 1985-86 and 61.1 per cent during 2001-02)

highest in the industry sector, followed by INI (12.4
per cent during 1985-86 and 50 per cent during
2001-02), mission-oriented R&D (8.51 per cent during
1985-86 and 46.8 per cent during 2001-02), and
universities and colleges (7.4 per cent during 198586 and 45.1 per cent during 2001-02) are the lowest
(Tables 8 and 9).
Collaborative research has shown faster growth
rate (729.6 per cent) than the country growth rate
in S&T publications (51.78 per cent). Mission-oriented
R&D sector has shown the fastest growth rate in
collaborative research output (1017 per cent) compared
to 102.9 per cent in total papers over 16 years,
followed by universities and colleges (726 per cent
compared to 35.6 per cent), INI (620 per cent, 79.8
per cent), respectively during the corresponding
periods (Tables 8 and 9).
Collaborative research at national level is greater
than that at international level as seen from publications
count (Table 10). It implies that attention in collaborative
research at national level is greater than at international
level. India’s partnership with other countries for
collaborative research had increased with time (from
70 to 96 and to 113 countries during 1985-86, 199394 and 2001-02, respectively). These countries include
the USA and Canada (in North America), Germany,
the UK, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland,

(from 292 to 2,763 papers), Asia (from 77 to 1,381
papers), Oceania (from 11 to 177 papers), Africa
(from 19 to 145 papers), and South America (6 to
147 papers) during 1985-86 to 2001-02. Despite
absolute increase in collaborative papers at international
level, India’s collaborative share with the USA had

declined from 43.8 per cent to 35.1 per cent, and
with Canada from 9.52 per cent to 4.91 per cent
during 1985-86 to 2001-02. On the other hand, its
collaborative share with the European countries
had been on rise (Table 11).
At subject level, collaborative share was the
largest in chemistry, followed by clinical medicine,
physics, biomedical science, basic life sciences,
and engineering during 1985-86 to 2001-02. Collaborative
share of publications showed rise in physics (from
16 per cent to 26.1 per cent) and in engineering
(from 10 per cent to 20.7 per cent) in contrast to
decline in biomedical sciences (from 15.3 per cent
to 8.97 per cent) and clinical medicine (from 19.4
per cent to 13.5 per cent) during 1985-86 to 2001-02.

Table 13. Per cent share of country output
by journal IF

5.4. Impact of Research Output
A significant share of India’s research output
in S&T (75 per cent to 80 per cent) is published
in low impact journals (IF between 0.01 and 1.99),
and 8 per cent to 15 per cent in medium impact
journals (IF between 2 and 3.99) and 0.96 per cent
to 5.12 per cent in high impact journals (IF 4 and
above). In addition, India published 3.5 per cent
to 10.8 per cent of its output in zero impact journals.
The marginal rise in country share in medium and
high impact journals coupled with corresponding
decline in its share in zero and low impact journals
is indicative of rising trend in the quality of India’s
overall research output, even though the rise so
discovered is still not significant (Tables 12 and 13). The
mission-oriented R&D sector showed the highest
average IF per paper (1.454), followed by INI (1.37),
universities and colleges (0.975), and industry (0.945)

sectors in 2001-02. All the S&T sectors have shown
rise in their average impact factor per paper during
1985-86 to 2001-02, the highest being in missionoriented R&D sector (67.3 per cent), followed by
universities and colleges (54.5 per cent), and INI
(50.5 per cent) and Industry (46.7 per cent) sectors.
It shows that the R&D sector has made relatively
significant progress in its average IF by switching
to higher IF journals for publishing its research
papers.
India’s share of high-cited papers (those receiving
20 or more citations per paper) is around 4.8 per
cent to 5.45 per cent, and of medium cited papers
(receiving 5 to 19 citations per paper) it is moderate
(24.4 per cent to 26.8 per cent). A major share of
the country’s output (28 per cent to 30 per cent)
failed to receive any citation since their publication
in 1985-86 and 1993-94 (Table 14). In this study,
only cumulated citations received by papers since
their publications in 1985-86 and 1993-94 (till February
2004) were considered for analysis.

5.5 Institutional Productivity and their
Ranking
The numerical strength of high productivity
institutions in S&T in the country is very low. In all,
only 24 institutions had been successful in publishing
300 or more papers each during the three study
periods 1985-86, 1993-94, or 2001-02. Their publications
activity showed rise over time. During 1985-86 to
2001-02, it was fastest in Anna University (ANNAUM),
Chennai; and Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced
Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore; followed
by Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT),
Hyderabad; Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP),
Kolkata; All India Institute of Medical Sciences
(AIIMS), New Delhi; and Bombay University (BOMBUB),
Mumbai. There was no change in the activity index
of publications in case of Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre (BARC), Mumbai, whereas institutions like
Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi; IIT, Chennai;
Punjab University (PANJUC), Chandigarh; and Banaras
Hindu University (BANAUV), Varanasi showed decline
in their activity index during the corresponding period
(Table 15).
The institutions were compared on selective
line indicators of performance. In terms of research
impact per paper, four institutions namely JNCASR,
Bangalore; TIFR, Mumbai; HYDEUH, Hyderabad;
and SINP, Kolkata topped the list (IF per paper of
2 and above). Five institutions namely Indian Institute
of Science (IISc), Bangalore; National Chemical
Laboratory (NCL), Pune; AIIMS, New Delhi; IICT,
Hyderabad; and Indian Association for Cultivation
of Science (IACS), Kolkata showed medium IF (1.5
to 1.99) during 2001-02. The maximum rise in IF
per paper from 1985-86 to 2001-02 was observed
in JNCASR, Bangalore followed by NCL, Pune;
IICT, Hyderabad; IISc, Bangalore; AIIMS, New Delhi;
BOMBUB, Mumbai; and IIT, Mumbai (Table 16).
JNCASR, Bangalore; TIFR, Mumbai; NCL, Pune;
HYDEUH, Hyderabad; IISc, Bangalore; and IACS,
Kolkata topped the list in terms of high citations
per paper (9 or more citations per paper published
during 1993-94). NCL, Pune; ANNAUM, Chennai;
SINP, Kolkata; PGIMER, Chandigarh; DELHUD, Delhi;
80

BARC, Mumbai; and IIT, Mumbai registered high
rise in citations received per paper published in
1993-94 over papers published in 1985-86 (Table
16). CQI has been devised as a relative measure
for computing quality of institutional performance in
research output. CQI is a composite indicator computed
on IF per paper, citations per paper, overall collaborative
share and share of internationally collaborative papers
of institutions. As per CQI the top 10 institutions
were: JNCASR, Bangalore; TIFR, Mumbai; HYDEUH,
Hyderabad; IISc, Bangalore; SINP, Kolkata; MADRUM,
Chennai; IIT, Mumbai; IACS, Kolkata; IIT, Kanpur;
and ISI, Kolkata (Table 16).

5.6 Growth in Publications Output by Subject
Chemistry, physics, and engineering have been
the leading areas of research in India and have
shown consistent rising trend in publications output.
Chemistry, however, was an exception, since it
showed a small dip in 1993-94. India’s combined
publications share in these disciplines has increased
from 56.5 per cent to 63.9 per cent over 16 years
from 1985-86 to 2001-02 (Table 17).
The national growth rate in these disciplines
during the same period of 16 years has been (69.08
per cent, 68.4 per cent and, 77.7 per cent, respectively)
above the country’s average of 51.8 per cent.
Agriculture, biology, basic life sciences, clinical
medicine, biomedical sciences and earth and
environmental sciences have been the medium productivity
areas of research in Indian science. Mathematics
and computer science have been its low productivity
areas. Over a period of 16 years, the publication
growth was fastest in clinical medicine (141.6 per
cent), followed by basic life sciences (81.6 per
cent), and biomedical sciences (76.4 per cent) during
1985-86 to 2001-02. In contrast, the country witnessed
slower growth in biology (-32.9 per cent), agriculture
(18.3 per cent), and earth and environmental sciences
(51.1 per cent). Mathematics also witnessed slower
growth rate. Computer science, though, witnessed
high growth (118.5 per cent) but its national share
is still very small (1.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent)
during 1985-86 and 2001-02. Since the government
had been providing substantial support to universities
and R&D agencies for research in computer science,
its low share in the country’s output is a matter of
concern (Table 17). The decline in the publications
share of agriculture in the national output may be
attributed to the inadequate coverage of agricultural
journals in the Web of Science. The national share
in earth and environmental sciences remained stagnant.
This discipline needs greater attention in view of

the challenges thrown by Tsunami, green house
effect and other environmental changes taking place
the world over. The decline and slow growth of
publications in biology and mathematics, in spite
of well-established departments and faculties (comparable
to physics and chemistry) in large number of universities
is a matter of concern. There is an urgent need to
improve course contents and focus in research in
both the fields. For example, changes in curriculum
from traditional to modern biology, and from traditional
mathematics to computational and applied mathematics
may attract more research funds, and make this
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(2)

research more relevant to Indian biotechnology and
computer industry and may help the students engaged
in research in these fields in getting employment
in India.

6. FINDINGS
India achieved 5.96 per cent average annual
growth in S&T publications during 1996-2005, and
its pace of growth is accelerating. As seen from
Web of Science, it was 2.51 per cent during last
eighteen years (1985-2002), 5.96 per cent during

last ten years (1996-2005), and 10.5 per cent in the
recent five years (2000-05). Compared to other
developing countries like China, Brazil and South
Korea, India’s world share in S&T publications is
still very low. If India has to catch up with these
countries, it has to evolve strong and effective strategies
aiming at still higher publications growth rate.
Among the various sectors, universities and
colleges sector is the largest in the country in
terms of publications output and institutional participation
in S&T research. Mission-oriented R&D sector ranks
second followed by INI, and industry sector. Despite
its largest institutional participation and publications
82

share, universities and colleges sector growth rate
in publications output (35.7 per cent) has been
below the country average (51.7 per cent), and
secondly its publications share has been declining.
In contrast, all other S&T sectors showed consistent
rise in their publications share. Evidently, universities
and colleges sector needs to be strengthened for
better performance in S&T research.
Collaborative research has been found to influence
both the quantity and quality of research output in
the country. Collaborative share of the country output
has shown significant rise from 7.3 per cent to 40.1
per cent during 1985-86 to 2001-02. Collaborative

research has shown faster growth over 16 years
(729.6 per cent) than the country growth in S&T
(51.78 per cent). Mission-oriented R&D sector has
shown the fastest growth in collaborative research
(1017 per cent over 16 years), followed by universities
and colleges (726 per cent over 16 years), INI (620
per cent over 16 years) during the corresponding
period 1985-86 to 2001-02. Collaborative research
activity at national level is greater than that at
international level. India’s collaborative research with
the Europe and Asia is on the rise while with North
America (USA and Canada) it is on the decline.
India spreads its research output in far too
many journals, leading to low concentration of papers
per journal and hence to their low visibility. This
practice of reporting papers in far too many journals
could be one of the reasons for India’s low citations
impact. There is an urgent need to motivate scientists
to publish mostly in specialised and high impact
journals. Data reveal that citations received per
paper have been on the rise for the Indian research
output published in foreign journals and declining
for the papers published in Indian journals.
Nearly 70 per cent of the country’s output in
S&T appears in low or zero impact journals, while
25 per cent output in medium impact journals and
only 5 per cent in high impact journals. Average IF
per paper has shown rise from 0.748 to 0.806, and
to 1.229 during 1985-86, 1994-95, and 2001-02,
respectively. Similarly, citations received per paper
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(2)

rose from 4.92 in 1985-86 to 5.26 in 1993-94. The
country needs to improve its publications share in
medium and high impact journals.
Research output in S&T coming from 90 per
cent institutions in the country is still very small
and much below the general expectations. The top
10 per cent institutions accounted for as much as
80 per cent of the output, and the remaining 90 per
cent account for just 20 per cent output. Thus,
special attention needs to be paid to the low and
medium productivity institutions to improve the overall
performance in S&T. Chemistry, physics, and engineering
are the high productivity research areas in Indian
science and technology. Agriculture, biology, basic
life sciences, clinical medicine, biomedical sciences
and earth and environment science are its medium
productivity research areas. Mathematics and computer
science are its low productivity areas. Clinical medicine,
basic life sciences and biomedical sciences are
the fastest growing areas of Indian S&T. Clinical
medicine showed publications growth of 141.6 per
cent, followed by basic life sciences (81.6 per cent),
and biomedical science (76.4 per cent), compared
to country average growth rate of 51.7 per cent in
sixteen years during 1985-86 to 2001-02.
India holds the potential to give higher growth
in S&T in the next 10 years. Given its infrastructure
and the skilled and sizeable manpower engaged in
R&D, the current growth in publications by India is
indeed too low and much below its overall potential.
83

The country must plan for catalysing higher publications
growth at least to catch up with leading developing
countries in next 10 years. For catalysing growth
and quality in research output, efforts may be made
to improve and nurture creativity of individuals and
teams, may be by catching talent at young age,
organising training programs, and rewarding team
efforts and by creating sophisticated instrument
facilities in low and medium productivity institutions.Given
their qualitative and quantitative performance in the
publications output, the INI and Inter-University centers
seem to be the effective models for influencing
research activity in the country.

7. CONCLUSION
The country must draw out long-term and shortterm plans for R&D developments in the country.
It needs to organise goal-oriented and need-based
programmes at the national and institutional level.
New programmes needs to be initiated in the country
to encourage greater institutional participation, greater
collaboration in research at national and international
level, attract young talent into science, organise inservice training of staff in creative and innovation
ideas, and set-up sophisticated instrument facilities
for S&T education and research in the country.
Special attention needs to be given to the universities
and colleges to enhance their quantity and quality
of research output. This can be done by further
improving the universities and colleges sector in
terms of the technical and computing infrastructure,
course-content, teaching methods, faculty development
in newer fields, allocation of funds in highly specialised
areas, creating better linkages with R&D and other
sectors, and by attracting new and bright talent at
masters and doctoral level. This must be accompanied
by strict criteria for the selection of students for
PhD programmes and their evaluation for the degree
and in faculty evaluation for time scale promotion.
At least one or two papers in a peer-reviewed journal
may be made mandatory for every doctoral thesis,
to enhance the growth of Indian research output.
There is an urgent need to strengthen linkages
between low, medium and high productivity institutions
within their own geographical regions. This would
also enable the low and medium productivity institutions
to benefit from the rich experiences of high productivity
institutions, and use their equipment and facilities
available in specific fields. Also, there is a need to
change methods of deciding priorities for allocation

84

of funds, particularly the extra-mural funds given by
research agencies, and also the priorities for awarding
research contracts. An element of competition should
be brought into the bidding of funds for large-scale
projects. There is strong need to strengthen the
monitoring and evaluation system, particularly in
the universities and colleges and also in other institutions
to ensure that their research output is reported
mainly in medium and high impact journals. Strict
evaluation measures needs to be evolved for ensuring
good quality output from PhD work and from the
projects funded by national agencies. Higher budget
allocation at the institutional level, for hiring doctoral
and post-doctoral students may also increase the
research output.
The country needs a much better regional distribution
of resources, in terms of funding support for creating
infrastructure, so that even low productivity states
are able to contribute higher. Develop new institutes
and strengthen existing ones especially in the low
productivity states on the model of INI. There is a
strong and urgent need to develop an effective research
strategy to enhance the country performance in
S&T research for quality and quantity by strengthening
the existing institutes in the low and medium productivity
states, as well as opening up new institutes in
such states. There is a strong and urgent need to
evolve new and effective strategies to improve research
productivity in medium productivity areas such as
agriculture science, biology, basic life sciences,
clinical medicine, biomedical sciences and earth
and environment science, as well as in low productivity
areas, such as mathematics and computer sciences.
There is a need to draw out plans for encouraging
scientists to publish in select high-impact journals.
High speciality journals are not being published in
the country in large number. Such journals have
special importance in arresting India’s outflow into
foreign journals. The quality of Indian journals may
also be improved by strengthening their peer-reviewing
system and making them more specialised. There
is a need to review and strengthen current arrangements
for international collaboration in science and technology
with developed and developing countries. India’s
collaborative research with countries like the USA,
UK, Russia, and Canada is on decline and with
countries like Germany, France, the Netherlands
and Spain is on the rise. New initiatives are needed
to strengthen the India’s collaboration both with
developed and developing countries.
