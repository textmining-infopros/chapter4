ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the library information-seeking behaviour among undergraduate students of
agricultural extension and education of Iran. By using stratified proportional random sampling (by Morgan
table), 230 persons were selected from four famous universities (Tehran, Shiraz, Mollasani and Kermanshah)
of Iran through questionnaires for this study. Reliability was measured by Cronbach-Alpha (á = 0.84), which
showed that the reliability of the questionnaires was acceptable. Scale-free technique, Principal Components
Analysis method, Eta test, and Correlation and Regression tools were used for data analysis. The findings
revealed that awareness of library scientific resources and availability of library resources items were the
most important and influenced factors in students’ library information-seeking behaviour. Students with higher
academic level are generally expected to have higher skills through information-seeking behaviour. On the
contrary, this study indicates that the students were not influenced by this. Gaps in the library facilities in
different universities (especially total number of related books to field and the number of computers) have
direct influence on students’ library information-seeking behaviour. Besides, interactions (searching by asking
other students and faculty) were the other means students’ used for seeking information.
Keywords: Library, information-seeking behaviour, agriculture students, availability of information resources.

1. INTRODUCTION
Students of agricultural extension and education
gather information to obtain higher level of knowledge in
the field for preparing academic course assignments and
project papers using a variety of information sources and
services. Toward improving knowledge about agricultural
extension and education in Iran, the basic academic
facilities for information-seeking process is necessary.
Libraries play an important role in students’ informationseeking behaviour, which is considered a multifarious,
dynamic, social human behaviour that needs a picture as
rich as possible to truly understand the phenomenon1.

2. LITERATURE REVIEWS
Graves and Seliq have emphasised the importance of
the medical library’s role, in developing life-long learning
skills in medical students2. They pointed out that
developing skills in information management and the
usage of information tools and databases are in need
among students. Undergraduate students often do not
Received on 9 February 2009

comprehend the necessity of learning the usage of library
resources, which are available to them nor do they always
realise that research skills will be a necessary part of their
future practice of medical profession.
Pelzer and Leysen in their study about library use
and information-seeking behaviour of veterinary medical
students at Iowa State indicated that the library was used
frequently for studying and making photocopies of
materials3. The typical respondent relied on course
textbooks and handouts for current information on
unfamiliar topics instead of using indexes or abstracts for
guidance to recent literature. Light use of information
resources raises the concern that students are
developing an inadequate base of retrieval skills for finding
information about new procedures, diseases, and drugs.
No differences were found between students with and
without formal bibliographic instruction in their
approaches in seeking information or in library use.
Kuhlthau conducted a study examining the
application of library skill in assigned library research by

high school seniors4. The objectives of the project were: to
explore the students’ experience of searching process in
the library; to reveal evidence supporting the hypothesis
that there are sequences of stages to an information
search; and to propose a model of the user’s stage within
the search process.
According to a study conducted by Rankin, the most
frequent use of library among medical students was for
studying course work and photocopier5. These findings do
not show any independent initiation of an information
search in the library. Also, textbooks and handouts had
the highest usage by all the students.
The findings of Liu and Redfern show that in using the
library, students with the English as their primary
language are usually more successful than those with
English as their second language6.
Findings of Fidzani7 indicated that guidance in the
use of library resources and services are necessary to
help students face their information requirements. The
study found that journals, library books, and textbooks
are the most popular sources of information for course
work and research, and students are in need to be taught
how to use library resources and services. Fidzani
pointed out that many graduate students lack basic skills
in using the library and its resources effectively.
Majid and Ai8 studied the use of information
resources by computer engineering students in
Singapore. They found that top information resources in
order of preference were books (94 per cent), lecturers (84
per cent), the Internet (86 per cent), and friends (84 per
cent). They relied heavily on printed sources.
Hartmann9 concluded that undergraduate students
experienced difficulties, in locating items from the library
collection and did not understood the processes for
retrieving journal articles.
Whitmire10 indicated that disciplinary differences
affected a number of information-seeking activities (e.g.,
use of online catalogues, indexes and library books
frequency). She also found that ethnic backgrounds also
influenced some aspects, such as students’ use of the
library catalogue and seeking help from librarians.
Drabenstott11 examined strategies used by 14
undergraduate students in a single search session
employing a information gateway—a university library’s
home page on the web that provided one entry point for
access to the library’s online resources. She concluded
that few undergraduate students were able to enlist
search strategies commonly taken by domain experts
(i.e., subject experts like professors). Domain-expert
strategies were used infrequently and ineffectively.

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(4)

Lee12 mentioned two common themes among under
graduate student’s information seeking: (i) undergraduate
students face enormous challenges in finding proper
information to satisfy their demands, and (ii) they want to
use a researching review on scholars’ information seeking
as least as possible. According to an Online Computer
Library Centre (OCLC) survey for information-seeking
process in library, more than 65 per cent of the students
reported that they learn about new information resources
from a friend; 50 per cent learn from teachers; 36 per cent
from the library’s website, and 33 per cent from librarians.
Kim14 in his study about student’s use of library
databases found that convenient access was an
important determinant of database use. Some students
preferred open Internet searches to web-based
subscription databases simply because of convenience.
Kim went on to note that competing with Internet
searching must be a priority for libraries in the future. To
compete with open Internet searches and to facilitate use
of web-based subscription databases, it is crucial for
libraries to increase the convenience of access and
awareness of the existence of the databases.
Chai15, in some of her findings suggested that
academic disciplines and achievements had some
correlation with how individual students sought
information. Following factors have also been studied by
various authors: gender16, academic year17, availability of
resources16, strategies of information seeking20, 21, grade
point average22, 23, capability in English6,24,25, satisfaction of
library facilities26,27, and awareness of library scientific
resources1,14.
The main purpose of this study was to investigate
library
information-seeking
behaviour
among
undergraduate students–academic level of Bachelor of
Science (BSc)–of agricultural extension and education in
Iran.

3. METHODOLOGY
The study was conducted in 2008. The statistical
population of the study comprised 587 students who were
studying in BSc level in public universities of Iran. Sample
size was determined by using Krejcie and Morgan table.
By using stratified proportional random sampling, 230
students were selected across the famous universities of
Tehran, Shiraz, Mollasani, and Razi Kermanshah. Data
were collected by filling out the questionnaires that had
been tested before and seconded, observations, and
secondary information resources (statistical references
for any universities).
The questionnaire had 61 items in 7 scales, and was
validated using both internal and external validity

13

procedures. It was primarily divided into four main
sections that consisted personal characteristics of the
responders (12 questions); satisfaction of library facilities
(9 questions); English language capability (6 questions);
strategies of information seeking (7 questions);
awareness of library scientific resources (12 questions);
and resources availability (15 questions). The Cronbach
alpha, computed to measure reliability of the library
information-seeking index, was 0.84, which showed that
index was suitable. Items in tables were selected
according to existence feasibilities and real satiations in
universities.
Content validity of questionnaire was obtained by
using a panel of university college members, and a multistep correction and review process. Data analysis was
carried out in two sections: data description and data
inferential analysis. Frequencies mean, standard
deviation, CV, Eta test, Scale Free technique, Principal
Components Analysis method, Regression Analyses, and
Correlation were used in the descriptive section.
In this study, since the indicators’ units are different,
using Scales Free Technique was necessary. Because of
using indicators for colleges or departments instead of
individuals, dividing into mean method was applied for
scale free28. For weighting indicators, Principal
Components Analysis method was used. The factors for
scaling free in questionnaire were derived from analysing
secondary information resources (statistical references
for any university), and 30 items related to access of
information resources. Therefore, the indicators’

components extracted in this study to determine level of
information resources availability for each university are
from the academic real situations and services. Figure 1
implied the research framework.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Demographics
Figure 2 shows that statistical society consisted of
17 per cent agricultural extension and education students
of the Tehran University, 22 per cent of the Shiraz
University, 40 per cent students of the Razi Kermanshah
University, and 21 per cent students of the Mollasani
University. Among all the agricultural extension and
education students (BSc level) 67 per cent were female
and 33 per cent male.

4.2 Capability in English
To identify and compare differences among students
with respect to capability in the English, F-test was used
(Table 1). According to findings, significance level is
different only between students of the Shiraz University
and the Mollasani University.

4.3 Satisfaction of Library Facilities
Among agricultural extension and education
students, items ‘searching by computer’ and ‘updating
resources’ were last priorities in library facilities
satisfaction, and the first item was ‘library possibilities’.

It was found that interactions (searching by asking
other students and faculty) was the students’ main
strategy for using library (accordance with Majid and Ai,
2002 and OCLC, 2006).

4.7 Availability in Library Resources
For determining availability in library resources for
students, making indicators, scale free technique and
principal components analysis were necessarily utilised
(Tables 2-5).

4.4 Students’ Awareness about Scientific
Resources in Library

4.8.1 Step 1
At first, according to Table 2, ratios were considered
for the Central Library Resources at the beginning:

It was found that ‘Farsi textbooks’ and ‘Farsi journals’
were the main resources students used in library.

Indicator 1 (I1): Number of related books to the major/total
number of department students.

4.5 Student’s Acquaintance about Library
Skills

Indicator 2 (I2): Number of librarians working in central
part/total number of faculty students.

According to this study, for the most students skill in
using title files and computer for searching in library was
the last priority.

Indicator 3 (I3): Number of scientific journals/total number
of department students.

Table 9 shows that factors like ‘academic year’ and
‘English capability’ had significant and positive correlation
with students’ information-seeking behaviour. Significant

5. CONCLUSION
The results of multiple regressions show that there
are several factors that have significant effect on students’
library information-seeking behaviour (Fig. 3). The factors
of ‘grade point average’, ‘awareness of library scientific
resources’, ‘skills of library seeking’, and ‘availability of
library resources’ are the main factors, and the factors of
‘awareness of library scientific resources’ and ‘availability
of library resources’ are the most important factors in
students’ library information-seeking behaviour.
Students’ strategies of information seeking in library,
is to prefer verbal communication (by asking peers and
faculty) instead of the main information-seeking strategy
of using library. So, it seems that, student’s awareness is
not good enough about library searching facilities and
neither about the importance of librarian’s role. In other
hand, it is necessary to orient the information-seeking
educational courses about main information-seeking
strategies and introduce the role of librarians for students.

Figure 3. Frequency Beta of variables for information seeking in library.

According to study, ‘Farsi textbooks’ and ‘Farsi
journals’ were the main resources for information seeking.
‘Skill in the English language’ influenced students’ library
information-seeking behaviour. Reasons may be the
faculty members’ orientation in teaching on Farsi library
resources and few English library resources. Attention to
weighting of indicators, total number of related books to
field, and number of computers for searching are also the
most important indicators in student’s informationseeking behaviour. Therefore, the related improvement in
these areas is necessary. Regarding the information
resources gap in libraries, diverse universities have higher
influence on students’ information-seeking behaviour.
Therefore, basic situations for promotion of students’
information seeking in libraries, varying services, and
updation of information resources in faculties and
departments are necessary.
Contrary of expectations and Whitmire study in 2001,
those with higher academic qualifications were also found
not skilled in library information-seeking behaviour; may
be because the academic courses are not oriented to
promote students library information-seeking behaviour29.
The effect of faculty member’s teaching strategies is
clearly important in promotion of students’ informationseeking behaviour. So, usage of information should be
part of all students’ education7,30,31.
According to the study, students with higher grade
prefer to use library resources and have higher level of
library information-seeking behaviour. It might be because
of the majority of academic assignments are on printed
materials. This is because faculty members rely on
printed resources heavily. Also, most of undergraduate
students lacked knowledge and experience in the field
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(4)

they were studying. So librarians and faculty members
have to notice this point in order to design home works
with active involvement of students32.
