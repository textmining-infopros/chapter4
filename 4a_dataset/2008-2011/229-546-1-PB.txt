ABSTRACT
The Web 2.0 and e-learning technologies of today have enabled digital learning resources that enhance
the learning experience of scientists and students from different fields. This paper explores the ways elearning is being used in the geoscience domain and how geoscience libraries are placing their systems and
services around them. After studying the worldwide scenario in this regard, the paper then reviews the Indian
scenario. It proposes ways to enhance the role of the various institutions and agencies and the libraries
affiliated to the Geoscience domain in India to gain from this technological development.
Keywords: E-learning, Web 2.0, e-learning 2.0, Library 2.0, geoscience library

1. INTRODUCTION
Knowledge and information are considered as the
most important resources in today’s world that leverage a
nation’s wealth and prosperity. This knowledge-based
society is not only changing the global economy but also
the status of education. Such knowledge-based
information society demands a workforce that is literate in
the use of technology that increases productivity and
creativity. This has resulted in advancement and
improvement in the quality of teaching and learning and
also the sharing of knowledge and information. The use of
information and communication technology (ICT) in
education has resulted in expanding access, promoting
efficiency, improving the quality of learning, enhancing the
quality of teaching, and improving management systems.
The evolution of distance learning to overcome the
physical barriers imposed by the brick and mortar
infrastructure of education has resulted in the complete
decentralisation of knowledge generation, representation,
and dissemination1. Online learning or e-learning, in the
simplest terms, is any education delivered using the
Internet. Initially synonymous with distance learning via
electronic media, e-learning has been around for more
than 10 years. It has now been extended to incorporate
traditional research blended with learning and teaching
and is a combination of face-to-face and online
instructions. The advantages of online learning are:
42



The ability of anybody to learn anywhere and at any
time.



Increase in the scale at which learning can take
place and thereby enhancement in accessibility.



Cost reduction as it replaces the mode of content
delivery.



Personalised learning allowing individual learners
greater control over their learning processes.



Experimental new things, thereby eliminating the
embarrassment of failure.



Elimination of the rigors of classroom-based
instructions that assumes the ability of learning as
uniform amongst learners, thereby giving each
learner his or her own pace to learn and excel.

The e-learning media of communication varies in its
structure, role and use from one field to the other and this
variance is most noticeable in the sciences. The Los
Almos National Labs e-print server is the best known
example that shows that high-energy physicists have
long led the sciences in the use of electronic media for
sharing working paper2. The world over, e-learning is being
used by experts from all domains as a cost-effective
solution to instructions. The geoscience domain is also
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

not averse to such developments. Not only does the study
of earth and space demand the latest technological tools,
systems and techniques, but it also results in the most
innovative technical developments. E-learning in such a
domain, therefore, has to remain relevant to cutting- edge
technologies for storage, access, and delivery of
information instructions.
The Internet revolution gave the term Web 2.0 that
further nurtured new ideas, identified as e-learning 2.0, for
education. Though used since long as a information
seeking tool, the Web today—best termed as ‘Web 2.0’
supports—enhanced multi-device oriented systems
thereby further enhancing the concept of studying at any
place at any time. Libraries as places that support
learning, have struggled hard to maintain with every
technological developments embracing each technical
shift to fight obsolescence.
This paper reflects how the libraries and librarians are
increasingly embracing the Web 2.0 technologies to
enhance their services and be defined as Library 2.0. It
explores the ways e-learning is being used in the
geoscience domain and how libraries are placing their
systems and services around them. After studying the
worldwide scenario in this regard, the paper then reviews
the Indian scenario. It proposes ways to enhance the role
by various institutions and agencies in the geoscience
domain in India to gain from this technological
enhancement.

2. WEB 2.0, E-LEARNING 2.0 AND LIBRARY 2.0
The Web 2.0 is characterised by user-generated
contents produced individually resulting in participation
and thereby generation of networking effects, openness,
harnessing of the power of the crowd collectively, and also
resulting in the generation of data and information on epic
scale. The Web 2.0 has generated the 2.0 lexicology,
including e-learning 2.0 and Library 2.0. Web 2.0 products
like wikis, blogs, RSS feeds, online office, social
bookmarking, video repositories and online videos,
podcass, social networks, and group workspaces are in
use for sometime now. However, there are few instances
to identify if e-learning 2.0, a term defined for the better
usage of such Web 2.0 resources, actually employs
these3. For some of these resources seem to have little or
no impact on the overall e-learning scenario.
The Library 2.0 or L2 offers unique new ways to
rethink and retool library services using tools like blogs,
wikis, instant messaging, RSS, and social networking. It
also offers new ways of involving patrons by letting them
contribute comments, add tags, rate library items, and
get involved in other interactive and collaborative activities.
Thus libraries are making use of the collaborative tools
and technologies to engage and share information rather
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

than just provide it. Recognising that librarians need to
know how to participate in the new media mix, for libraries
to remain relevant, librarians worldwide are engaged in
creating blogs and podcasts using Flickr, setting up RSS
feeds, learning and using wikis, uploading videos into
YouTube, playing with image generators, and exploring
Technorati, tagging, and folksonomies. The 2.0
technology thus makes it possible for libraries to offer a
lot more services without the licensing and maintenance
requirements.

3. WEB 2.0 AND THE GEOSCIENCES
The digital resources, tools, and networks of the
ICTs, influence ways in which scientists investigate the
real world, the way they organise and communicate what
they know, and how they think. Such resources offer
effective ways of handling the geoscience information by
opening up possibilities of more rigorous analysis with
quantitative and statistical methods and more vivid
visualisation techniques. Such tools have revolutionised
the manipulation, management, and rapid dissemination
of scientific data, information, and knowledge. E-science
an abbreviation used for changes related with information
technology in the scientific disciplines, used in
conjunction with other terms like e-Research and eScholarship shows the transformative shifts sweeping
across the scientific domains as a result of the
information technology revolution in particular4.
The Web 2.0 has facilitated the conduct of science
and research into a global enterprise, which transcends
geographical boundaries, disciplines, and educational
levels. It facilitates the ability of scientists to work with
experts from all over the world, to use resources
distributed in space across international boundaries, and
to share and integrate different types of data, knowledge,
and technology being generated in real time from all
around the world.
Information and communication technology
applications have no disciplinary boundaries. As such,
these applications have always been an integral part of
the evolution of various branches of geoscience, which is
centered on geology, but it inevitably, overlaps into various
subjects like geophysics, geobiology, geochemistry,
applied geophysics that includes geophysical
prospecting and exploration, general geology that
includes
internal
geodynamics,
geotectonics,
tectonophysics, external geodynamics, historical
geography or stratigraphy, economic geology, and soil
science. While atmospheric science, environmental
science, surveying and geomorphology are related to the
geoscience, one should not confuse these with subjects
like hydrology, meteorology or oceanography, which are
broadly into the domain of the Earth sciences5. The
geosciences encompass an enormously complex
43

human-natural system that operates over vast temporal
and spatial scales. This discipline is a storehouse to
massive data sets involving physical and digital
information that is geo-spatially referenced. Geoscience
data are highly heterogeneous and impact numerous
other disciplines like ecology, medicine, biology,
agriculture, etc. They are characterised by rich metadata
and must be catalogued for long-term access involving
decades or centuries owing to the nature of the
associated research challenges.

4. E-LEARNING IN THE GEOSCIENCES:
WORLDWIDE SCENARIO
The observations of the Earth’s environment have
been an activity since time immortal. The geoscience
community is one of the largest producers of scientific
data on the Earth’s environment. Using the latest tools
and techniques for gathering, storing, preserving, and
accessing such data overtime has always been the forte
of geoscientists. The Geographical Information System
(GIS) is an example of the latest computer-based system
for handling map information in this field. As such,
educators and researchers have no difficulty adopting
their teaching skills to the changing information world.
Geophysics educators worldwide have been developing elearning courseware as a useful aid for students. A
number of geology, Earth science networks,
organisations, institutions have developed educational
and outreach materials on the web.
Probably, one of the best examples of technology
being used over the web to explore the Earth’s resources
is Google Earth, with its huge database of images taken
over a period of time. The US Holocaust Museum and
Google have developed an impressive application to
further enhance the web experience of the Google Earth
and use it in classroom settings or otherwise6. This
application can be used in lab or lectures; it mashes up
data from the Google Earth, and uses personal
testimonials and maps of settlements from the UN Office
for Coordination of Humanitarian Affair. The result is an
unbelievably striking display of images, thereby
enhancing the understanding of a particular location,
which would not have been possible otherwise.
In the US, while 70 per cent of all institutes offer
distance learning, 80 per cent offer hybrid learning
courses7 where instructors post material on the web for
students for further discussions. A number of e-learning
modules of learning by doing for teaching students to use
maps and aerial images, and to identify and analyse
geologic features have been developed. For example, the
Geoscience Department at the University of
Massachusetts
(http://www.geo.umass.edu/),
has
developed the dynamic digital maps (DDM) computer
program, which is basically a ‘presentation manager’ that
44

contains, texts, field trip narratives, and analytical data
along with maps, images, and movies, which are
displayed as icons when looking at a geological map. The
DDM can be run on a computer projector on any lab/
lecture. It provides a rich learning environment in the
context of digital images showing geologic examples and
details. The Department of Geological Sciences of the
University of Kentucky (http://www.uky.edu/AS/Geology/)
uses the web to teach non majors about natural disasters
like earthquakes. Drawing advantage of its postings of
lecture notes and exercises on the web, it assesses
students’ learning. The Department of Geology at the
University of Ball (http://www.bsu.edu/geology/) has
implemented a web-based testing technique called
INQSIT, which allows the teaching faculty to gain valuable
class time, while increasing the flexibility in testing and
reducing students’ anxiety by decreasing the amount of
study material covered for test.
A workshop on e-learning Environments for
GIScience Education, conducted by the Centre for
GeoInformatics, Salzburg University, Austria, as part of a
project International Cooperation for GIScience Education
co-funded by the European Commission under Asia Link
Program in 2005 attempted to cover a number of elearning issues with respect to GIS education. This
resulted in the UNIGIS International (http://www.unigis.
org/), a worldwide network of educational institutions,
offering internationally recognised qualification via
distance learning courses in the field of GIS.
Many country-specific projects, with respect to widescale implementation and adoption of e-learning as a new
improved teaching strategy, can be found. New Zealand
has undertaken a variety of projects, from course
developments to even the smallest contribution to the elearning process, being undertaken by teachers or
departments or the institutions. With centralised funding
from universities, these projects are implemented in the
local context. One of its projects, Geology 205–New
Zealand Half A Billion Years On The Edge (http://
cad.auckland.ac.nz/index.php?p=eprojects) aims at
developing the historic geophysical time-space
relationship of New Zealand. Assessment linked to web
resources would entail students building their own
timeline and answering interpretative questions using a
timeline map. Such a map would provide links to
webpages covering stories, illustrations, just-in-time
glossary, significant events, historic data, etc. Animations
would be developed and photographs from the university’s
own collection would be used. Such materials would thus
be without copyright.
Similarly, eight European Geo-Informatics Institutes
have used their existing courses for course exchange
through e-learning program (http://www.edugi.net/eduGI).
For each course offered, a course is received in return.
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

For example, The Institutio Superior de Estatistica e
Gestao de Informacao, Universidade Nova de Lisboa,
Portugal, participates in the project by offering its elearning course Geo-Spatial Data Mining. In turn it
receives the course on project management, from the
University of Munster, Germany. The UK has a national
policy to encourage people to be familiar with new
technologies that impart education8. The Geography,
Earth and Environmental Sciences (GEES) practitioners
in the UK are engaged in various projects in the
development of e-learning materials over many years
now9.
E-learning cuts across space and time to reach
countries like Serbia that are isolated geographically. The
SinYU Project, the Scientific Information Network of
Yugoslavia, was initiated and governed by the MaxPlanck-Institute fur Physik10. This project currently
connects the elementary and high schools with electronic
libraries and local e-learning applications, with a goal of
further expanding into the GEANT network, European
Cyber Infrastructure Program that enables highperformance, Grid-enabled communications network for
its researchers4. In Europe, Italy has embarked on the
Educational Seismological Project (EduSeis) with the
aim to develop and implement new teaching
methodologies in the Earth Sciences11. This E-learning
project has been built for high-school students, whereby
students working in small groups are supervised by their
teachers. Such a student-teacher interaction on the
online teaching modules aids useful insights into the
future contents, modules and activities of EduSeis, and
offers a new approach to teaching seismology. The
learning experience through such e-learning modules
could easily be enhanced by further using the Web 2.0
tools and techniques described above in the geoscience
domain.

5. GEOSCIENCE IN INDIA
The first systematic studies in the field of geological
sciences in India began with the establishment of the
Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784. Asiatic Research was
one of the society’s most important journals in the field.
Geological research further gained momentum with the
establishment of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) in
185113. GSI today is spread all over the country with its
regional centres and circle offices.
Most of the universities in India, including the
Institutes of national importance, are engaged in
geoscientific study and research through their respective
geoscience departments. These institutions offer
undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctorate level courses
in the area. Some important government departments that
are engaged in geoscientific investigation and research
include:
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)



Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India (ONGC)



Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM)



Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)



Atomic Minerals Division (AMD)



National Remote Sensing Agency



Various Directorates of Geology in the different
states of India

There are 16 central and state level autonomous
research organisations in India. One of these being the
Indian Institute of Geomagnetism. These organisations
are fully or partially engaged in geological investigations
and research. There are nine professional societies and
associations contributing in significant ways towards the
growth and development of geoscience in India by
bringing out journals, organising seminars, etc. Recently,
a new Earth Commission has been set up, and the Union
Ministry of Ocean Development has been renamed as the
Ministry of Earth Sciences (http://www.dod.nic.in/) to
bring together all researchers on land, ocean, and
atmospheric systems into the domain of Earth System
Sciences. The aim of the ministry is to network all
institutions and agencies involved in earth sciences,
remote sensing, and oceanography in order to
systematise work flow and remove functional flaws.
The geological prospecting and investigating
departments are engaged in a highly competitive
knowledge intensive work. Despite realising the potential
that e-learning brings into the workplace, it is still in its
infancy in the education or the industrial sector of
geoscience and allied fields in the country. Apart from a
few individual efforts and attempts at self-help, there is no
concerted effort to leverage e-learning in the geoscience
domain by private or public agencies in the country.
All the universities, research organizations, and
professional societies in the field of geoscience in the
country have a library associated with them. Most of the
geoscience libraries in India have the requisite
infrastructure and technical competence to embrace the
latest in technologies and trends. The geoscience
libraries have been involved with capturing, documenting,
and organising traditional wisdom and knowledge
generated over centuries. Some libraries, like the Indian
Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), have an invaluable
collection of magnetic data. The IIG is the only contributor
of magnetic data from India to a network of magnetic
observatories established all over the world, under the
name of World Data Center14. Similarly, other
geoscientific institutes in the country are engaged in the
production of various types of scientific data. Libraries in
such institutes are involved in long term preservation, and
45

generating subject-specific bibliographic databases.
Despite experimenting with various modes of information
provision, geoscience librarians have however, not yet
engaged in any e-learning initiative. It would not be hard to
say that since the education and industry sectors in the
geoscience domain have lapsed in bringing the benefits of
e-learning to their subject specialists in the first place,
geoscience libraries as aids to the knowledge process
have not made amends to their work process.

6. GEOSCIENCE LIBRARIANSHIP
The best example of digital library (DL) engagement
in the e-learning scenario is the Digital Library for Earth
System Education (DLESE)12. The DLESE is an online
storehouse of high-quality educational materials about
the Earth and its environment. Representing a beginning
among the DL developers towards library-maintained
repositories for data and documents, and the digital
reference desk, the DLESE represents one approach to
increase user involvement in growth of educational DLs.
With an aim to provide a mechanism for the teachers and
students to engage in online communication, the DLESE
helps aggregate student reviews, generate individualised
reports, and evaluate and reformat information tools and
services to maximise the usefulness of the materials
provided.
The geosciences libraries and librarians have a huge
stake in the geoscientific information scenario in view of
the enormous expenditure on geoscientific research.
Worldwide the geoscience librarian community has
responded positively to the constantly evolving web.
Frequent courses, on the information skills required of the
geoscience librarian/information specialist, are organised
either by professional bodies, or the Geoscience
Librarians’ groups. Many of these societies have an online
presence as websites, e-mail forums, or discussion lists.
Courses focusing on subject specialisation, specific
competencies and services with respect to the changing
information scenario, users and their continuously
changing information needs, management and teaching
skills, seeking funding and grant writing, etc. are
continuously offered. Such courses are either offered as
seminars, or pre-conference tutorials, or as continuing
education programs (CEP) of the department or institutes
that the library or librarians is affiliated with.
More recently, the trend has been towards webcasts
of seminars or conferences. Such webcasts often have
their own wikispace, RSS feeds, and other widgets for
further discussion and elaboration on the topics covered.
Further a copy of the recorded webcast could be posted
on Youtube.com or blogged. Besides the dynamic ways
in which a library and information professional could
engage him in the e-learning process as discussed
above, an adaptation of any of the Web 2.0 tool would
46

result in a more meaningful engagement of the
geoscience information specialist with the Web 2.0 world.

7. SUGGESTIONS
The right implementation and combination of
approaches with regards to ICTs can help India solve a
number of problems pertaining to Indian education
scenario. For example, a combination of virtual
classroom, online tutors, digital libraries, and the virtual
reference tools in local languages could help the rural
Indian youth to compete with the outside world and move
towards information literacy path irrespective of their
socio-economic status. E-learning could be a powerful
tool for lifelong training to workplace employees and help
them remain competitive. It is thus a successful tool to reskill large workforces that become redundant over time.
To remain relevant, libraries worldwide need to
constantly adapt and re-invent themselves with any
advances brought in by the ICTs. Library professionals
can play a significant role in the E-learning process as
such programs are tailored to update their knowledge
periodically. Learning from a host of Web 2.0
implementation initiatives in libraries abroad, libraries in
India in general and geoscience libraries in particular, too
can undertake the following steps:


Have features like study rooms and other spaces
within the library devoted to support the users and
their changing needs and habits.



Should market and brand their services and
products.



The libraries with institutional repository or any such
ICT implementation or any new user services, should
brand their services as the leading unit in the
institution.



Build a web-presence, either in search engines or the
wikipedia.



Stress on providing services through the Internet or
over the phone or the mobile.



Libraries should use blogs, RSS feeds, widgets and
other forums to stay informed of the latest subject
enhancements and in-turn connect in better ways
with the library users.



Librarians should remain connected to their
professional communities to remain update and
informed of the happenings in their field.



Library advocacy is a must and libraries must stress
for the role of libraries in any decision regarding elearning or any related policy.
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

The following suggestion need to be taken into
consideration for E-learning initiatives in the geoscience
domain:
(i)

There is a need for the government and other
interested agencies to consider geoscientific
information as a basic ingredient for the growth and
development of geoscientific research.

(ii) Professional bodies in the geosciences like GSI, can
play an active role in enhancing the role of libraries
and information professionals. It is proposed that
such professional bodies could have a special group
for information professionals like in the Geological
Society of America. Such societies would be
committed to furthering the role of libraries in
geoscience education by promoting excellence in
innovative approaches to library systems and
services for furthering instruction, research, public
service, and practice.
(iii) There should be a National Information Centre for
geoscientific information. The centre could have local
information centres for natural disaster awareness
and mitigation.
(iv) To network all the geoscience libraries in the country
and share their resources by bringing out a union
catalogue of books, periodicals, reports, maps,
reprints, microfilms, E-resources, etc. The
community could have a presence on facebook with
an aim at creating awareness of new and existing
resources amongst the users. Besides collaborating
and communicating within their group, the
geoscience librarians could post online tutorials to
help the library users learn the geoscience
information resources.
(v)

The Indian Library Association could have different
caucus and sections representative of individual
subject domains. The role of such subject-specific
groups should be enhancement of the role of IT in
library applications, the e-learning being one of its
technical applications.

(vi) The Digital Library of India (DLI) initiative could have
subject portals providing information space and tools
to facilitate the work of students, educators, and
scientists. Using open source tools, such digital
portals could easily transform into a laboratory/
workspace by integrating digital repositories into the
researchers’ workspace, thereby enhancing the
impact between research and education.

8. CONCLUSION
Education is the single most important instrument for
improving the quality of life in the country. The right
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

combination of learning tools can enable every individual
to draw on his talents of memory, reasoning power,
imagination, physical ability, aesthetic sense, aptitude to
communicate, etc. e-learning tools have the ability to
revolutionise the Indian education scenario. It can help in
India’s quest for information literacy amidst the huge data
and information deluge. It can empower its citizens by
imparting lifelong learning and training capabilities
irrespective of their socio-economic status and bring India
to the forefront of development.
