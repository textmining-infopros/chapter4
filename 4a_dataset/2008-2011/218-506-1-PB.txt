ABSTRACT
The study presents a detailed analysis of research performance of biotechnology faculties in central
universities of India from 1997-2006. The data used for the study were retrieved from two database
sources, namely, PubMed, NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information); and ISI Web of Science
database—Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE). Bibliometric techniques have been employed to
analyse the data. The results indicate that the growth of literature in biotechnology has steadily increased
from 15 articles in 1997 to 43 articles in 2006; two-authored publications predominate amongst the pattern
of authorship; applicability of Lotka’s law is validated from the values n = 2.12, C = 0.669, and D = 0.027
obtained using least square method. However, the application of Bradford’s law does not fit to the
literature analysed.
Keywords: Bibliometrics, biotechnology, biotechnology faculties, Universities, India, Lotka’s law, Bradford’s law

1. INTRO DUCTION
During the last two decades, biotechnology, as
one of the important disciplines of life sciences, is
being offered and gaining momentum among higher
educational institutions, viz., universities, colleges
of science and engineering, research institutes, etc.
in India. The development of biotechnology is making
visible impact in varied areas such as biology, medicine,
agriculture, and environment1. According to Confederation
of Indian Industry (CII) estimates2, India produces
roughly 2.5 million graduates in information technology,
engineering and life sciences, 650,000 post graduates
and nearly 1500 PhDs in biosciences and engineering
each year. Qualitative research prov ides a pedestal
to any university. It speaks of the fertile minds and
an environment of intellectual interaction in the university3.
India, with a population of more than a billion,
has a huge market for biotechnology products and
services. Hence, Indian situation demands R&D in

biotechnology. The Indian subcontinent, which occupies
only 2.4 per cent of the total global surface area,
has the most varied species of flora and fauna. India
has about 7.6 per cent of total mammal species,
12.6 per cent of bird species, 11.7 per cent of
fishes, and roughly 6 per cent of total flowering
plants that are present in the world 3. Patra and
Chand 4 summarised the growth of biotechnology
literature from 1 article in 1982 to more than 300
articles in 2003. They have also stated that there
is a growth in R&D output over the years, but for
the period of 22 years, both the number of manpower
devoted to it and the number of institutions, it looks
low.
Arunachalam 5,6 clarifies that universities are still
in the lead in contributing biotechnology publications.
He also specified that the reason for greater volume
of work at the higher educational institutes, compared
to better endowed national laboratories, is the presence
of a large number of doctoral students.
11

Keeping in view the above, an attempt has been
made to analyse the research performance of faculties
of biotechnology in 20 Indian central universities.
Bibliometric techniques have been employed to conduct
the research as it is especially useful when studying
a research-intensive subject field such as biotechnology
where the industry is likely to have close relations
with public research organisations (e.g., universities).
As far as the number of universities is concerned,
India has prospered starting with 28 univ ersities in
1950–51 to 350 universities7 of different kinds—central,
state, open, deemed, and so on—registering a manifold
increase. Growth in numbers is expected to cater
to the increasing number of students.

were used to analyse the final data collected in
order to generate tables, charts, graphs, etc.

At the same time, it is important to assess the
performance of faculty in terms of research contribution
in their respective fields of study. Present study
aims to ascertain the growth of literature; sources
of publications; identification of prolific authors; institutions,
core journals and related impact factor, etc. in the
field of biotechnology by faculty in central universities
of India for the period 1997–2006. Applicability of
Lotka’s law and Bradford’s law has also been tested.

4. BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS

2. DATA SOURCE AND METHODOLOGY
The data for the present study was retrieved
from two sources namely, NCBI (National Centre for
Biotechnology Information) PubMed; and ISI Web of
Science database– Science Citation Index Expanded
(SCIE). PubMed is the NLM’s (National Library of
Medicine, USA) premier online bibliographic database
which is freely accessible, and cov ers the subject
fields such as medicine, nursing, dentistry, veterinary
medicine, health care system and the preclinical
sciences. Web of Science is a product of ISI that
prov ides access to current and retrospecti v e
multidisciplinary information from approximately 8500
research journals all over the world. The search
strategy used for collecting data for Aligarh Muslim
university was as follows: “Topic=Biotechnology OR
Biotech*; DocType=All Documents; Time Span=19972006; Institution or University=Aligarh Muslim Univ”.
The same strategy was used to collect data for 10
other univ ersities only by changing name of the
university.
A total of 345 records were retrieved from PubMed
and SCIE. From the total records collected, 16
records were found duplicate and were eliminated.
Finally, a total of 329 unique records of various
types, viz., articles (303), rev iews (18), correction
(4), letters (3), and editorial material (1) was considered
for analysis. MS–Excel Spreadsheet and MS–Word

3. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
Though there are 20 central universities in India,
the present study is confined to only 10 univ ersities
(Table 1) as there were no records found from the
databases for other universities. The literature analysed
were published during a period of 10 years from
1997–2006. Data collection was limited to two empirical
databases namely PubMed and ISI Web of Science–
SCIE which are more comprehensive and widely
used for conducting research.

Some of the bibliometric models and indicators
employed for the study to analyse the collected
data, based on PubMed and SCIE were:

4.1 Collaborative Coefficient
Collaborative coefficient (CC), suggested by Ajiferuke8
and used by Karki and Garg 9 has been used to
measure the extent and strength of collaboration
among the faculties of biotechnology in central universities
of India. It can be expressed mathematically as:
j =k

CC = 1 − ∑ (1/ J ) f j / N
j =1

(1)

where f j is the number of J authored papers published
in a discipline during a certain period of time
N is the total number of research papers published
in a discipline during a certain period of time and
k is the greatest number of authors per paper in a
discipline.

4.2 Lotka’s Law
Lotka’s law is a classical method used to test
the regularity in the publication activity of authors
of scientific literature. It describes the frequency of
publication by authors in a giv en field. It states that
the number of authors making n contributions is
about 1/n² of those making one; and the proportion
of all contributors that make a single contribution
is in the region of 60 per cent. This means that out
of all the authors in a given field, 60 per cent will
have just one publication; 15 percent will have two
publications (1/2² times 60); 7 per cent will have
three publications (1/3² times 60), and so on 10-13.
This law can be expressed as:
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(6)

y = C × x −n

(2)

where x is the number of publications of interest
(1,2, etc.); n is an exponent that is constant for a
given set of data; y is the expected percentage of
authors with frequency x of publications, and C is
a constant
The productivity corresponds not to the number
of articles published by an author but to its logarithm;
it seems that a multiplicativ e, rather than simply
additive, model provides a better fit to this measure
or counting method.
The exponent n is often fixed at 2, in which
case the law is known as the inverse square law of
scientific productivity. However, given that the exponent
n predicts the relative number of authors at each
productivity lev el it would seem useful to calculate
it. In the present study, least square method has
been used. It can be expressed as:

n=

(3)

N ∑ X 2 − ( ∑ X )2

where N is the number of data pairs considered
X is the logarithm of x (x=number of articles) and
Y is the logarithm of y (y=number of authors)
The constant C is calculated using the formula:
1

∑1 / x

(4)

n

To verify that the observed distribution of author
productivity fits the estimated distribution, Pao (1985)
suggested applying the non-parametric KolmolgorovSmirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit test. To this end, the
maximum difference between the real and estimated
accumulated frequencies was calculated, and this
value was then compared with the critical value
(c.v.) obtained from the following equation:

c.v. =

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
5.1 Central Universities
Out of the 20 central univ ersities in India data
from only 10 universities were available, therefore,
rest of the universities were not considered for the
study. Table 1 gives the list of universities considered
for the present study.

discipline is scattered over a range of journals. It
states that “if scientific journals are arranged in
order of decreasing productivity on a given subject,
they may be div ided into a nucleus of journals more
particularly devoted to the subject and several groups
or zones containing the same number of articles as
the nucleus when the number of periodicals in the
nucleus and the succeeding zones will be as 1:n:n2…”.
In addition to the above bibliometric methods, some
common statistical tools such as Mean, Standard
Deviation and Coefficient of Variance have also been
used.

4.3 Bradford’s Law
To identify the core journals of a particular discipline,
Bradford’s law14 has been tested. This law describes
studying the extent to which literature in a particular
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(6)

Table 2 depicts the year-wise distribution of
total research output of central universities in India
in biotechnology. It is observ ed that the output of
10 central universities has grown steadily during the
period of study from 16 in 1997 to 46 in 2006.
However, there was a sudden increase in the output
in the years 1998, 2002 and 2006 producing 31, 45
and 46 records, respectively while a decreasing
trend was observed in the years 2000 and 2004.

5.3 Type of Publications
Biotechnology literature in India has been published
in different types of publications. The majority of the
literature has been published in journals. Table 3

The Faculty in PU contributed 7.60 per cent of
the literature of the total biotechnology research
output and is placed fourth. The year-wise variation
is 110.35 per cent in the level of research output by
this university during the period of study. This variation
is mainly due to zero output in the years 1997-2000
and less output in the years 2003 and 2006.

shows that journal articles form the majority of the
literature output (92.10 per cent) followed the reviews
5.47 per cent, corrections 1.22 per cent, letters
0.91 per cent, and editorial material 0.30 per cent.
It is observed that the articles being a prominent
source constantly increased during the period of
study except for the years 2000 and 2003.

5.4 University-wise Performance
Table 4 summarises year-wise performance of
central univ ersities in relation to their contribution
in biotechnology research during the period 1997–
2006. BHU that contributed 42.55 per cent is placed
first. The level of variation in research output is
36.42 per cent which is the least amongst all the
universities. The lowest coefficient of variance, in
case of BHU, speaks of the consistent performance
of its Faculties throughout the period of study.
The share of JNU comes to 25.53 per cent of
the total research output of Indian universities during
the period of study. It is placed second in order.
Encouraging performance is noted in the years 1998,
1999, 2002, and 2004, which amounted to more
than 50 per cent of output, and resulted in 47.69 per
cent of year-wise variation in biotechnology research
output. AMU ranks third in order contributing 15.50

VBS, DU, and TU occupied the next three positions
contributing 3.34 per cent, 2.43 per cent and 1.82
per cent, respectively. The year-wise variation in the
performance output of such universities is 100.05
per cent, 129.10 per cent and 140.55 per cent,
respectively. A high level of variation of these universities
speaks of the poor performance of research in
biotechnology during the period of study.
The contribution of remaining three univ ersities
namely JMI, NU, and BBAU was less than one per
cent of total research output. The share of JMI is
0.61 per cent while NU and BBAU got only 0.30 per
cent each.
From the above analysis, it can be deduced
that BHU shares 42.55 per cent of total biotechnology
research output over the period of study. The other
ranked universities are JNU 25.53 per cent, AMU
15.50 per cent, and PU 7.60 per cent, respectively.
NU, and BBAU share the last position of research
productivity. Highest level of variation 316.23 is found
in NU and BBAU.

5.5 Authorship Pattern
It is a well known fact that nowadays, research
is carried out by group of researchers rather than
by a single researcher. Therefore, the data were
analysed to know the authorship pattern in biotechnology.
Through collaboration, researchers share and exchange
knowledge and techniques, that bring in a mixture
of positive scientific thoughts and decrease cost at
the same time. 15 Bibliometricians have paid due
attention to these phenomena ever since. Intensifying

co-author relationship has been reported for all fields
and at practically all levels of aggregations, for instance,
by Glanzel 16 for the macro level, by Gomez17 for the
meso level, and Ding 18 and Glanzel 19 for the micro
level. As a result, multi-authorship necessarily increases
productivity and always results in high citation impact20.
In the light of the above fact, an attempt has
been made to identify the nature of authorship pattern
in scientific research output made by the Faculties
of Biotechnology in central universities of India. It
is evident from Table 5 that two-authored papers
rank first in order sharing 33.73 per cent of the total
research output. The year-wise analysis shows that
the performance of two-authored papers has been
increasing in almost all the years except for 2000
and 2004. The three-authored papers follow second
in order taking 24.92 per cent of the total research
contributions followed by four- five- and six-authored
contributions sharing 19.15 per cent, 11.55 per cent,
and 5.17 per cent of the total scientific research
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(6)

output during the study period, respectively. It is
interesting to note that single-authored papers occupy
seventh position in order totaling fiv e contributions
which represent only 1.53 per cent while seven-,
eight-, nine-, and ten- or more authored contributions
record 2.13 per cent, 0.30 per cent, 1.22 per cent
and 0.30 per cent, respectively.
Based on the data presented in Table 5, the CC
using Eqn. (1) was calculated. The calculated value
of CC (last row of Table 5) for the study period does
not vary much for different years. The value of CC
is lowest (0.54) for 1997 and highest (0.69) for 2005.
This indicates that the biotechnology research among
faculties of central universities in India is fairly collaborative.

613 authors. The ratio of the number of authors to
articles is about 1.86. It is very interesting to observe
from Table 6 that 409 authors, which accounts for
66.72 published only one article whereas only 11
authors contributed more than 10 articles (1.79 per cent).
To validate the Lotka’s law, a calculation was
done using Eqns (2-5), (Table 7), to know the values
of n and C to test whether application of Lotka’s law
fits the data or not. Thus, based on the data presented
in Table 6, the calculated values of n and C are 2.12
and 0.669, respectively.
The critical value is 0.065 and the value of
maximum difference (D) between the real and estimated
accumulated frequencies is 0.027, which is less
than the critical value 0.065. This resulted in fitting
the application of Lotka’s law to the data of biotechnology
literature.
Table 8 depicts prolific authors who have produced
more than five articles in biotechnology during the
period of study. The findings of distribution of authors
in terms of their number of contributions reveal the
fact that R.Prasad from Jawaharlal Nehru Univ ersity
is in the First place with 21 different publications
in biotechnology. The second place is taken by
A.K.Tripathi from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi
with 14 publications; the third place is to three
authors from Banaras Hindu University, namely A.Kumar,
L.C.Rai and S.A. Abbasi , with 13 articles each; and
so on. On an average, the high percentage of publication
by individuals is given by BHU (120 articles) followed
by JNU (57), PU (42), and AMU (25). Only one
researcher of BBAU (7) takes the last place among
16

the individual researchers who have produced more
than five articles.

5.7 Identification of Core Journals
The literature in biotechnology covered in the
present study (1997–2006) comprises a total of 303
articles published in 75 journals (Table 9). It is found
that 33 journals published only one article each, 11
journals published two articles each, 6 journals published
3 articles each, 5 journals published 4 articles each
and the rest of 20 journals published more than 5
articles each. Table 9 shows that 4 journals (3.28
per cent) published maximum segment of information
with 32.01 percent of articles while the second larger
group of 16 journals (21.33 percent) provided the
next equal of 33.33 per cent articles.
The third largest of 55 (73.33 per cent) journals
published the next 113 articles (37.29 per cent).
According to Bradford’s Law of distribution the relationship
between the zones is l:n:n 2 (i.e. 1:5:25). But the
relationship between the zones in the present study
is contradictory in each as 4:16:55 which does not
fit into Bradford’s distribution. It is concluded that
core distribution of articles were published by a very
few journals. Based on the data presented in Table
9, the cumulative number of articles was plotted
against the logarithm of ranking of journals according
to Bradford’s plot (Fig. 1).
The result reveals that the core journals are
those whose points lie on the initial curved part of
the ‘S’ until it tangentially becomes a straight line.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the slope of the curve
decreases slightly after the fourth journal, so it
appears that the top four journals (Table 10) are well
in their way to form a core.

5.8 Country-wise Distribution of Journals
Country-wise distribution of journals and research
output of literature in biotechnology. Table 11 shows
the contributions of faculties in central univ ersities,
both in Indian and International sources of publications.
It can be observed that the faculties of central universities
have made 303 contributions published in 75 journals.
These journals are published from 16 different countries.

report that only one article was published in biotechnology
in 1982 that grew to more than 300 articles in 2003.
A large number of researchers is pursuing their
research in the field, giving hope that more literature
would be published on the subject from universities.

It is obvious that the researchers in central
univ ersities of India have preferred to publish their
research articles in international journals especially
from the Netherlands. It includes 29.04 percent of
publications over the study period. US ranks second
in order with 28.71 per cent followed by England
(20.46 per cent), Germany (6.60 per cent), Czech
Republic (3.96 per cent), and Korea (2.64 per cent).
The contribution in journals of Singapore and Switzerland
is less than 2 per cent whereas countries like Japan,
Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Croatia, India, and
Poland yield less than 1 per cent. The result shows
that the researchers of biotechnology in central universities
of India opt for international sources to get international
recognition, international standard, and international
collaboration. Almost two-third of the articles was
published in journals published from the Netherlands
and US. In contrast, only 0.33 per cent was published
from Indian journals.

The contribution to the literature on the subject
fromthe universities has been steadily growing. It
was 15 articles in 1997 and 43 in 2006. BHU is
leading from the front with 42.55 per cent contribution.
It also leads with the most consistent performance
amongst all the universities. JNU comes next followed
by AMU. There is a trend towards collaborative research
with two-authored papers being maximum followed
by three-authored papers. When the author productivity
was calculated it was found that 66.72 per cent
authors contribute one article and that 11 authors
(1.79 per cent) contribute more than 10 articles.
Lotka’s law was tested and found to fit the data. The
credit of publishing the maximum number of articles
(21) goes to R.Prasad of JNU followed by A.K.Tripathi
of BHU who contributed 14 articles. The data does
not fit into Bradford’s law regarding the core journals.
The articles contributed by the Faculties appeared
in journals published from 16 different countries with
a maximum from the Netherlands followed by US.
Only 0.32 per cent articles were published from
India.
