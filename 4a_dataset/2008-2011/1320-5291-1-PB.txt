ABSTRACT
The present study undertakes the ranking of the most productive Indian institutions, viz., institutes of
national importance, universities/ deemed universities, industrial enterprises, research institutes, Indian
Institute(s) of Information Technology (IIIT(s)), select top engineering colleges, and regional engineering colleges
(RECs)/National Institutes of Technology (NITs) in computer science research for their research output published
during 1999-2008. The publications output of these productive institutions is judged on the basis of various
quantitative indicators, such as the total number of raw papers and international collaborative papers and
qualitative indicators, such as the average number of citations per paper and h-index value, and also in terms
of a new composite indicator, which combines quantitative and qualitative aspects.
Keywords: Computer science, institutions, India, scientometrics, h-index, p-index

1. INTRODUCTION
Broadly, the term information technology (IT), as is
now understood, refers to the computer and
communication technology used to acquire, store,
organise, manipulate, transport, and exchange
information. The definition includes computer hardware
and software, as well as telecommunication devices and
computer-based networks that connect them. The IT as
defined by the Information Technology Association of
America (ITAA) is ‘the study, design, development,
implementation, support or management of computerbased systems, particular software applications and
hardware’1.
The information and communication technology (ICT)
has been considered as one of the most important
instrument in bringing about a wide ranging socioeconomic transformations in India and other developing
countries in 21st century. Many governments view the IT
sector as an important engine of growth and taking
measures to stimulate the sector output as a means of
accelerating economic growth. The ICT sector in India
spreads over both organised and unorganised segments
of manufacturing and service sector. According to
Department of IT of the Ministry of Communications and
IT, the ICT sector is a fast growing sector of Indian
Received on 31 March 2011

industry, with a recorded production of Rs 1182.9 billion
during 2003-04, which was estimated to have reached Rs
3682.2 billion during 2008-09, recording a growth of more
than three tines during the last five years.
The software industry, which was worth Rs 744.9
billion in 2003-04 was estimated to achieve a production
of Rs 2735.3 billion during 2008-09. The software exports
have risen from US $ 17.7 billion in 2004-05 to an
estimated figure of US $ 46.3 billion in 2008-09.The ICT
sector GDP has increased to Rs 2530 billion in 2007-08
from Rs 656 billion in 2000-01, with a CAGR of 21.3 per
cent. Within ICT sector, computer-related services grew
at a rate of 27.23 per cent per annum, in contrast to
manufacturing sector growing at 11.4 per cent per annum
during 2000-01 and 2007-08. The share of ICT services
sector to total Indian GDP was 5.52 per cent during 200708, which was only 3.05 per cent during 2000-01. The
share of ICT manufacturing sector remained more or less
constant with about 0.35 per cent share to GDP 2000-01
to 2007-082.
The education and training institutions in the field of
computer science and technology may be grouped into
formal and informal sector. The formal sector comprises
institutions within the university system (university
departments of computer science and colleges affiliated
460

to universities), regional engineering colleges (RECs)/
national institutes of technology (NITs), and institutes of
national importance (seven IITs; IISc, Bengaluru; and ISI,
Kolkata). This sector also covers the institutions outside
the university system, viz., training institutions
recognised by the All India Council for Technical
Education (AICTE), including the newly established
Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIITs) in several
states, and the DOEACC accredited training institutes.
All these institutions belong to the formal sector in the
sense that these all come under the regularity authority of
the AICTE. These offer programmes at various
hierarchical levels-Certificate, diploma, post-diploma,
graduation, post-graduation, and doctorate level.
Some sort of equivalence has been established
between the courses offered by the university system and
those by the non-university system. For example, the
DOEACC accredited B level award is treated equivalent
to Master of Computer Application (MCA) degree. The
informal sector consists of a large number of private
enterprises spread across the country, often refereed as
training vendors, which offer a perplexity variety of
courses. These include several organisations (more than
1500 centres), including NIIT and APTEC (both with more
than 5000 centres), ECIL, ET&T, etc. These offer variety of
short-term and long-term courses (ranging from 1 month
to 3 years) in developer tools, RDBMS, web and internet,
e-commerce, multimedia, programmes in IBM
mainframes, ERP And AS/400, etc. and industry-certified
courses of Global Infotech majors including Microsoft,
Oracle, Cisco, IBM, etc. Some of the private vendors offer
long-term degree-like programs and often collaborating
with foreign universities to award degrees3-5.
A large number of institutes from academic sector,
R&D sector (government-sponsored) and private sector
(industry-sponsored) involved in computer science
research in India. These organisations are involved in a
wide breadth of research problems under all major areas
of computer science. Besides spending a considerable
amount of money on infrastructure development and R&D
activities on their own, these organisations are also
getting enormous funds by way of extramural support
from several Indian research agencies.
Computer science research in India is funded and
promoted by several agencies-e.g., the Ministry of Human
Resource Development (MHRD), AICTE, and University
Grants Commission (UGC) primarily fund research in
education sector, including in computer science. In
addition, agencies and departments such as Department
of Information Technology, Ministry of Communication &
IT; Department of Electronics, Defence Research &
Development Organisation; Department of Atomic
Energy; Department of Space; Department of Science
and Technology; and Council of Scientific & Industrial
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(6)

Research fund research as well as conduct research with
institutions working in their areas to support their own
research objectives. In addition, foreign and Indian firms
support research projects in computer science in Indian
academic and research institutions6

2. METHODOLOGY AND DATABASE
A total of 83 Indian institutions with comparative
higher output of publications in computer science during
10 years (1999 to 2008) were identified. These 83
institutions had each published 35 or more papers during
this period, as per the publication data downloaded from
the
Scopus,
an
international
multidisciplinary
bibliographical database. Together, they contributed
14375 papers, constituting 90.27 per cent papers to the
total cumulative research output of India in computer
science during 1999-2008.
The citations (c) received by papers of these institutes
are considered for first three years (three year citation
window) from the date of their publication (c). This allows
the average number of citations per paper (C/P) to be
computed for each of these institutes for the three-year
citations window. h-indices for these institutions for the
same period (i.e., 1999-2008) were also determined from
the Scopus database. Similarly, the number of papers,
which resulted from international collaboration, could also
be determined (TICP) using appropriate search strategy
and from this percentage share of papers from
international collaboration to the total number of papers
published ( per cent TICP) could be established.
Papers can be assessed for quality only when the
impact in terms of the citations obtained over the period of
the citation window is taken into account. This problem is
complex, as there are several ways of ranking
performance, e.g. the simplest and crudest being by
quantity of output (papers  as shown in Table 1), impact
(citations  not shown here), or by quality (mean citation
rate = C/P as shown in Table 1), or by a performance
index combining quantity and quality, e.g., the h-index (as
shown in Table 1).
The insight emerging from some recent studies which
have re-visited the problem of ranking research
performance of any entity (from individuals to countries)
as one belonging to the domain of random multiplicative
processes, considers the best single indicator to be used
for ranking using quality and quantity together, to be a
geometric mean of C and C/P according to Prathap,
However, by dimensional analysis, one can show that this
has the dimensions of h3/2. Indeed, a substitute or mock
h-index defined as hm = (C2P)1/3 is the best indicator for
performance7-9, having the correct dimensionality, that of h
according to Prathap, henceforth being called as p-index.
The ranking using this p-index is shown in Table 2.

3. ANALYSIS AND RANKING
Table 2 shows the raw scientometric data for top 83
institutes contributing to computer science research
output, i.e., the number of papers published (P), the
citations obtained during the citation window (C), the
average number of citations per paper (C/P), the number
of papers resulting from international collaboration (ICP)
and the percentage thereof (% ICP). Also shown in Table 2
are the h-index and the newly proposed composite
performance index (p).
Some old insights are reinforced and some new
insights emerge from Table 1 and 2. It is not surprising
that by number (quantity) or by performance (quality and
quantity combined), the Institute of National Importance
(INI) (including IISc, Bangaluru; ISI, Kolkata; and IITs) lead
among all engineering and technological institutes in the
country.

Among the select engineering colleges, only three
institutions have improved in terms of performance
ranking as measured by p-value, compared to their
productivity ranking. For example, the Mepco Schlenk
Engineering College has improved its performance index
ranking to 31th rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 28th rank
in terms of h-index, 14th rank in terms of average citation
per paper and 57h rank in terms of publication
productivity), Manipal Institute of Technology to 38th rank
in terms of p-value (in spite of 30th rank in average citation
per paper, 44th rank in terms of h-index and 60th rank in
terms of publication productivity), and College of
Engineering, Thiruvantapuram to 66th rank in terms of pvalue (in spite of 61th rank in terms of average citation per
paper, 67th rank in terms of h-index and 78th rank in terms
of publication productivity).

Among the four IIITs (having also the status of deemed
university), two have improved in terms of performance
ranking as measured by p-value, compared to their
productivity ranking. For example, the IIIT, Hyderabad,
has improved its performance index ranking to 15th rank in
terms of p-value (in spite of 19th rank in terms of h-index,
26th rank in terms of average citation per paper and 16th
rank in terms of publication productivity) and IIIT,
Bengaluru to 29th rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 22nd
rank in average citation per paper, 60th rank in terms of hindex and 52nd rank in terms of publication productivity).

Among the universities/deemed universities status
engineering colleges, more than 50 per cent have
improved their performance in terms of p-values compared
to their productivity. For example, the University of
Calcutta has improved its performance index to 13th rank
in terms of p-value (in spite of 11th in h-index, 12th rank in
average citation per paper and 15th in publication
productivity), Netaji Subhash Institute of Technology,
Delhi to 16th rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 11th rank in
average citation per paper, 22th rank in h-index and 23th in
publication productivity), Bengal Engineering and Science
University, Howrah to 26th rank in terms of p-value (in spite
of 26th rank in h-index, 28th rank in average citation per
paper and 32th in publication productivity), Bharathiar
University to 26th rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 8th
rank in average citations per paper, 36th rank in h-index
and 58th rank in publication productivity), Dayalbagh
Educational Institute, Agra to 30th rank in terms of p-value
(in spite of 13th rank in h-index, 52nd rank in average
citations per paper and 59th rank in publication
productivity), Tezpur University to 35th rank in terms of pvalue (in spite of 18th rank in average citations per paper,
74th rank in h-index and 68th rank in publication
productivity and University of Madras to 37th rank in terms
of p-value (in spite of 19th rank in average citations per
paper, 45th rank in h-index and 75th rank in publication
productivity.

Although the NITs have been around for a long time
(earlier known as RECs), and have been upgraded to
deemed university, their research performance is still very
dismal. Except for two institutions, the performance has
gone down in terms of p-value compared to their
productivity. For example, the NIT, Kurukshetra, has
improved its performance index to 67th rank in terms of pvalue (in spite of 76th rank in terms of h-index, 68th rank in
terms of average citation per paper and 70th rank in terms
of publication productivity) and Malaviya NIT, Jaipur to 69th
rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 67th rank in average
citation per paper, 79th rank in terms of h-index and 83th
rank in terms of publication productivity).

In the industry, again more than 50 per cent
enterprises have improved their performance in terms of pvalues compared to their productivity. For example, the
IBM-India office has improved its performance index to 5th
rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 8th rank in h-index, 6th
rank in terms of average citation per paper and 9th rank in
publication productivity), Bell Lab Research Centre, India
to 9th rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 1st rank in average
citation per paper, 9th rank in terms of h-index and 22th rank
in terms of publication productivity), Motorola, India to 22th
rank in terms of p-value (in spite of 10th rank in terms of
average citation per paper, 33th rank in terms of h-index
and 44th in terms of publication productivity) and Wipro

Among the INIs, IISc, Bengaluru continue to hold the
first rank in performance in terms of p-value, productivity
(P) and h-index, but 5th rank in average citation per paper.
Similarly, ISI, Kolkata improved its ranking to 2nd place in
terms of p-value and in h-index, in spite of 3rd rank in
average citation per paper and 5th in productivity. Similarly
IIT, Kanpur has also improved its performance ranking to
4th place terms of p-value, in spite of 6th rank in h-index and
7th each in productivity and average citations per paper.
The IIM, Kolkata has also improved its performance
ranking to 2nd rank in average citations per paper, in spite
of 17th in h-index, 19th place in p-value and 25th in
publication productivity.

Technologies to 40th rank in terms of p-value (in spite of
17th rank in terms of average citations per paper, 46th rank
in terms of h-index and 82th rank in publication
productivity).
Among the four research institutes, three have
improved their performance compared to their productivity.
For example, the IMS, Chennai has improved its
performance index to 11th rank in terms of p-value (in spite
of 13th rank in terms of h-index, 4th rank in terms of average
citation per paper and 21th rank in terms of publication
productivity), BARC, Mumbai to 25th rank in terms of pvalue (in spite of 21th rank in average citation per paper,
34th rank in terms of h-index and 49th rank in terms of
publication productivity) and C-DAC, Pune to 55th rank in
terms of p-value (in spite of 50th rank in terms of average
citation per paper, 72th rank in terms of h-index and 64th
rank in terms of publication productivity).
Table 3 reveals the performance of the Indian
engineering and technological institutions (measured in
terms of p values) when they are grouped into various
categories. It is seen that the institutes of national
importance as group leads in terms of research
performance among these seven groups, followed by
universities/deemed university, industry, research
institutes, IIITs, select engineering colleges, and NITs/
RECs.

Similarly among the four IIITs, the best performance in
terms of p-index values (6.49) is shown by IIIT,
Hyderabad, followed by IIIT, Bangalore (4.57); IIIT,
Allahabad (1.88); and Atal Bihari Vajpayee IIITM, Gwalior
(1.86). Among the 10 NITs, the best performance in terms
of p-values (3.13) is shown by Motilal Nehru NIT, followed
by Institute of Technology; Banaras Hindu University
(2.95); NIT, Tiruchirappalli (2.88); NIT, Surathkal (2.67);
NIT, Kurukshetra (1.67); Malaviya NIT (1.60); NIT,
Rourkela; (1.45); and NIT Warangal (0.93).

The ranking of the various institutions within each
group defined above according to the p-index also give an
indication of how each category performs within its peer
group. These 83 institutions consists of 10 INI, 4 IIITs, 8
NIT/RECs, 4 research institute (RI), 11 select engineering
colleges (SEC), 33 university/deemed university (Univ/
DU) and 13 industry enterprises.

Among the 12 select engineering colleges, the best
performance in terms of p-index values (6.32) is shown by
NSIT, Delhi, followed by Mepco Schlenk Engineering

4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a very rational procedure for ranking the
research performance of Indian institutions contributing to
computer science research in the country is used. The
overall ranking of top 83 Indian institutions and ranking of
individual institutions among the seven groups of
institutions give an indicative, if not nearly comprehensive,
assessment of how the institutions of higher education
are performing as generators of new knowledge in
computer science.
