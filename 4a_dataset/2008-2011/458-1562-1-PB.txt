ABSTRACT
Webometrics is concerned with measuring aspects of the web: websites, web pages, parts of web
pages, words in web pages, etc. This study examines 40 central universities websites in India. Investigates
domain systems of the websites, analyses the number of webpages and link pages and calculates the simple
web impact factor, self link web impact factor, external link web impact factor and revised web impact factor
for Central universities in India and ranks the websites as per the WIF. It also develops a novel network diagram
showing link structures between web nodes in webometric analysis. This study warns against taking the
analogy between citation analysis and link analysis too far.
Keywords: Central universities India, world wide web, webometrics, search engines, link analysis, web impact factor

1. INTRODUCTION
In the face of a growing demand for education and
fundamental changes in higher education in most
countries, the increasing value gets the creative
coordination of world universities on the basis of a
constant exchange of experience between them. The
easiest and the effective way to operational exchange of
information is publication on the website. Enhancing a
web policy expands the dialogue between the
universities, contributes to the formation of new
communications in the scientific community, and helps
the realisation of innovative development. This would shed
some light on the use of key communication medium and
could lead to more effective academic use of the web. The
World Wide Web (WWW) has now become one of the
main sources of information on academic and research
activities, and therefore is an excellent platform to test
new methods of evaluating webometric activities.
A website is a collection of related web pages,
images, videos or other digital assets that are addressed
relative to a common Uniform Resource Locator (URL),
often consisting of only the domain name, or the IP

address, and the root path (‘/’) in an Internet Protocolbased network. A website is hosted on at least one web
server accessible via a network such as the Internet or a
private local area network.

2. CONCEPT OF WEBOMETRICS
Since the mid 1990s, the nature and properties of the
WWW have been increasingly investigated by applying
modern informetric methodologies. The term webometrics
is a coinage from two modern English words, “web” and
“metric”. The word web is a short of WWW. The Dictionary
of Science define web as: a hypermedia system… that
allows users to view and retrieve information from
documents containing links”. On the other hand, metrics
has to do with counting or measurement. Webster’s
Comprehensive Dictionary of English Language defines
metrics as: “the mathematical theory of measurement.”
Webometrics is a quantitative study of web-related
phenomena. The webometrics study could be applied to
web with commercial search engines providing the raw
data. Quantitative studies of the web have been named as
webometrics by Almind and Ingwersen although the basic
33

issue had been identified simultaneously by Larson who
is also a pioneer with his early exploratory link structure
analysis with the first pure informetrics analysis of the
web.1-2
Bojorneborne defined webometrics as: “the study of
the quantitative aspects of the construction and use of
information resources, structures and technologies on the
web, drawing on bibliometric and informetric
approaches”.3 This definition covers the construction side
and usage side of the web, which embrace the following
four main areas of webometrics study:

This study covers all the central universities listed in
the Department of Higher Education websites in India4.
Table 1 depicts the year of establishment of 41 central
universities in India. There was a phenomenal growth
during 2001-2010; nearly 22 (53.66 per cent) central
universities were established during this period. Banaras
Hindu University was the first central university
established in 1915. In the last 21 years, about 30 central

The Government of India is responsible for arranging,
allocating and distributing financial resources required by
the University Grants Commission (UGC) for the
establishment of central universities in India. Currently
there are 41 central universities in India (Appendix 1).
Improving the quality and access of higher education and
research in India have become all the more important
keeping in view the growing needs for qualified human
resources in various sectors of the economy. Therefore, it
can be hoped that there would be more central
universities in India in the near future.
The Central Government has also been empowered by
a Special Act of the Constitution to maintain a particular
standard conducive to the educational health of the
country. The Central Government lays special emphasis
on research and development carried out in technical as
well as other institutions.
Salient features of Central Universities in India are:


The President of India acts as the ‘Visitor’ for all the
Central Universities.



The President has the power to nominate few
members to the Executive Committee/Board of
Management/Court/Selection Committees of the
University in terms of the various statutes and
provisions laid down in the University Act.



The Ministry of Human Resources and Development
(MHRD) assists the President of India in the
appointment of Vice Chancellors, Court Nominees,
and Selection Committee Nominees.

universities have been established, which reflects the
growth of higher education in India.
The distribution of central universities in India is
given in Table 2. Almost all the Indian States and Union
Territories have established at least one central university.
While Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have the maximum of four
(9.76 per cent) central universities, Andhra Pradesh has
three (7.32 per cent) followed by Assam, Bihar and
Manipur with two and remaining 24 States with one
central university each.

4. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
Jeyshankar, Ramesh Babu, and Gopalakrishnan
explained basic frame work and development of
webometrics from librametrics, informetrics, bibliometrics, scientometrics and cybermetrics.5
Thelwall states that the earlier weblink studies have
used the webpage as the primary indivisible source
document for counting purposes.6 He defined three
alternative heuristics for the educational arena based
upon the directory, the domain and the whole university
site, and examined 108 UK university institutional
websites. Noruzi investigated the Web Impact Factor
(WIF) for the Iranian universities and introduced a new
system of measurement.7 Jeyshankar and Ramesh Babu
examined websites of 45 universities in Tamil Nadu
comprising 27 State universities and 18 private
universities.8 Their study identified the domain systems

Internet measure whether internet can be used as a tool
in Indian political context.9 The results indicated that
political parties in India are using Internet as one of the
viable tools for campaigning and that Internet can be used
as a supplementary tool for measuring popularity.
Ramesh Babu, Jeyshankar and Nageswara Rao studied
34 State agricultural universities’ websites in India.10 They
investigated domain systems of the websites, analysed
the number of webpages and link pages, and calculated
the simple WIF, self link WIF, external link WIF and
revised WIF. They ranked the websites according to their
WIF. They suggested that WIF can be calculated as a
way of comparing the attractiveness of websites or
domains on the web, and proposed a novel network
diagram notation to fully appreciate and investigate link
structures between web nodes. This study warns against
taking the analogy between citation analysis and link
analysis too far.

5. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the study are:

pages and WIF, self link WIF of the university websites in
Tamil Nadu, and ranked the websites as per the WIF.

(i)

To identify and classify the domain of central
universities’ websites in India.

(ii) To find the number of webpages, number of link
pages, number of self link pages, and external link
pages of central universities’ websites in India.
(iii) To measure the simple WIF, self link WIF, external
WIF and revised WIF of central universities’ websites
in India and rank them as per the WIF.
(iv) To construct the link network of the Department of
Educational websites in India.

6. HYPOTHESES
The following are the hypotheses framed for this
study:
(i)

A majority of the central universities in India have
hosted websites on the Internet.

(ii) The domain structures of websites of these
universities in India are heterogeneous.
(iii) Higher the number of webpages, smaller the link
pages; and the greater the WIF, smaller the number of
webpages.

7. SCOPE
This study makes a webometric analysis of central
universities’ websites in India. There are 41 central
universities in India. One Central University of Tamil Nadu
do not have website. Therefore, this study examined the
websites of 40 central universities in India. The study

35

aimed at to establish a kind of academic ranking of these
websites by measuring their WIF. The study of the
ranking will help the reader to compare and identify
central universities websites in India by their WIF.

8. METHODOLOGY
The study used AltaVista (www.altavista.com) search
engine for collecting data. Altavista advanced web
queries was used to find the approximate number of
pages in each website that links to one another. The
Altavista query is based upon the lexicon of the domain
names of webpage URLs. AltaVista has been used to
search and collect data. The data collection method
extensively makes use of four special keywords like
domain, linkdomain, linkdomain AND, linkdomain AND
NOT and linkdomain NOT. From AltaVista search engine,
as surveyed by Thelwall (2002)11, the four Boolean
search statement methods were used to collect data for
each agricultural university websites as:
Domain:ugc.ac.in: Extract the number of webpages at
the website under www.icar.org.
Linkdomain:ugc.ac.in: Reveals the number of link
webpages linking to the website under www.icar.org.
Linkdomain (ugc.ac.in AND domain: ugc.ac.in): It
provides a complete report of number of webpages under
www.icar.org; which provides hyperlinks to website
www.icar.org. It is called self links pages (links from the
same website).
Linkdomain (ugc.ac.in AND NOT domain: ugc.ac.in): It
provides the report of number of pages not under
www.icar.org. It is called external link pages.
Linkdomain (ugc.ac.in NOT domain: ugc.ac.in): Reveals
the number of links incoming from other websites.

9. WEB IMPACT FACTOR
Web impact factor is a part of the methodology in
webometrics studies. The idea of measuring WIF as one
of the quantitative indicators (or the average link
frequencies) was developed by Ingwersen.12 WIF is a
‘snapshot’ of a search engine database at a specific time.
Broadly, it is a measure of the extent to which it is linked
to and recognised by other sites. The WIF is a form of
measurement used to determine the relative standing of
websites in particular fields, or a country, for instance,
academic web sites in a country. The higher the WIF, the
greater the perceived reputation of the website. The idea
of applying revised WIF techniques to the web was
proposed by Noruzi.13 According to them, WIF is defined
as the ratio of links made to a website to the number of
pages at the website. The WIF provides quantitative tools
for ranking, evaluating, categorising, and comparing
websites, and top-level domains and sub-domains. Four
36

types of links and WIF are formulated in the following way:


The simple WIF: the ratio of all links to the number of
pages.



The self link WIF: the ratio of selflinks within the site
to number of pages.



The external WIF: the ratio of links made from
external sites to the target site, to the number of
pages at the site.



The revised WIF: the ratio of links made incoming
from other sites.

Table 3 reveals that nine types of ‘domain extensions’
were observed in this study. Almost one third of the
university websites have ‘.ac.in’ (47.5 per cent) extension,
followed by ‘.org’, ‘nic.in’ (15 per cent) and (10 per cent)
and edu.in and ‘org’ in extensions in three (7.5 per cent)
universities each. This phenomenon explains that there is
no homogeneity among the central universities websites.

Table 4 illustrates the rank distribution of central
universities in India according to their simple web impact
factor (SWIF). Dividing the number of link pages (B) by
number of webpages (A), the SWIF for each university
has been calculated. Mizoram University occupies the
first place with 262 link pages and 41 webpages with 6.39
SWIF. The second and third place goes to central
university of Himachal Pradesh and Jawaharlal Nehru
University, respectively. University of Delhi (12200) and
Indira Gandhi National Open University (19100) have more
number of webpages than the above three universities,
but they are ranked 17th and 20th, respectively based on
their SWIF.
The ranking of central universities in India is based
on their Self Link Web Impact Factor as shown in
theTable 5. Central university of Orissa occupies the first
place with 14 self link pages and 18 webpages with 0.78
