ABSTRACT
The revolution of information technology has forced the world to depend more and more on
information and communication technology products and services. Due to this rapid growth, the ICT
products and services are being overwhelmingly used in all spheres of life. This paper studied the usage
of different ICT products and services by the students and faculty members of Veer Surendra Sai
University of Technology for fulfilling their information needs.
Keywords: Information and communication technology, Internet, search engine, mean deviation, standard
deviation, arithmetic mean

1. INTRODUCTION
Libraries have played an important role in providing
a variety of learning resources for study and research in
all spheres of education at school, college or at university
level. The last few decades have witnessed a spectacular
change in relationships between the users and libraries.
This is only because of the impact of information and
communications technology (ICT) an umbrella term that
includes any communication device or application,
encompassing radio, television, cellular phones,
computer and network hardware and software, satellite
systems including myriad services and applications
associated with them, such as videoconferencing and
distance learning, etc. The ICT-enabled products and
services and the availability of online information
resources have changed the way the services of
academic libraries and institutions are being now
delivered.
Dilevko and Harris1 in their paper have reported as
how the traditional library is undergoing significant
changes due to the electronic revolution, which in its
various manifestations has affected nearly every aspects
of information provision. The ICT now plays a crucial role
in shaping the academic institutions and their services so

as to meet the information needs of the students,
researchers, faculty and the institution as a whole.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
According to Kooganurmath and Jange2 a majority
of the users use Internet for communication followed by
the access to information. More than 70 per cent of the
users use Internet for their higher studies and only 39 per
cent use it for discussions with the peer groups. The most
used services of Internet are e-mail, the Web, discussion
forums and FTP. Mishra, Yadav and Bisht3 in their study
have shown that 67.7 per cent of Internet users were male
and 32.3 per cent were female students. Their study also
showed further that 61.5 per cent of the male and 51.6 per
cent of the female students used Internet primarily for
preparing their academic assignments.
Asemi4 in her study, on the other hand, reported that
55 per cent of the total respondents search internet
primarily for scientific information because their university
library provides access to various databases and online
journals. Internet was also used by the respondents for
downloading software or text, chatting, discussion, e-mail
services, and for finding related references. She also
observed that, the Google and Yahoo search engines
311

were more widely used compared to other search
engines. Her study further revealed that, 54 per cent of
Internet users always find useful information on the net
while 31 per cent of the respondents surveyed believed
that, quality information is available on the Internet and 35
per cent of the studied population used print, online and
offline form of information for updating their subject
knowledge.

3. VEER SURENDRA SAI UNIVERSITY OF
TECHNOLOGY
Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology
(VSSUT), formerly known as University College of
Engineering (UCE), Burla, the oldest and premier
Engineering College of Orissa, is a constituent College of
Biju Patnaik University of Technology, Rourkela. It has
already produced more than 10,000 graduate engineers
and 2000 postgraduates in different fields of engineering
and technology. The college was founded on 12th August
1956 under Utkal University. In 2009, under section 12B of
UGC Act, 1956 Govt. of India, it was declared a
university.

4. OBJECTIVES
Information and Communication Technology has
significantly affected the system and services of library to
a great extent. Availability and access of multiple format
of e-resources (both online and offline) is one of the major
impact of ICT in libraries. These resources have become
an integral part of any modern library. The basic objective
of this paper is to make a study on the usage of ICT-based
products and services by the students and faculty
members of the VSSUT, Orissa. The other key objectives
of the study are:
(i)

To find out the level and purpose of use of various
ICT-based products and services

(ii) To determine the frequency of use of ICT based
products and services
(iii) To unfold the impact of ICT on study and research in
professional and technical disciplines
(iv) To unearth the level of expertise on ICT-based
products and services among the user community
(v) To identify the problems incurred by the user
community while using ICT-based products and
services.

5. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
The limitations of the study are:

312

The study covers only the respondents from VSSUT,
Orissa.



Limitation by category of respondents, i.e. the
present study covers only the final year regular
students of BTech and all the full-time regular
students of MCA and MTech.

6. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY
A structured questionnaire was distributed among
480 respondents including all the graduate students (final
year BTech), post graduate students (MCA and MTech)
and all the faculty members of VSSUT. A total of 333
completed filled-in questionnaires were received having a
response rate of 69.38 per cent.

7. DATA ANALYSIS
Statistical techniques such as arithmetic mean,
standard deviation and mean deviation were used
wherever needed. The mean and standard deviation were
calculated to ascertain the level of variations amongst the
variables by using the following computed formula:
Mean Deviation (δ) = x - X
where, x = number of response, and X = number of
responses
Standard Deviation (σ) = √ ∑ (x- X)2 /N
where,

∑ (x-

X)2 = sum of the squares of mean deviation.

(72.67 per cent) considered their knowledge of ICT
product and services as strong, followed by 55 (16.52 per
cent) manageable, 27 (8.11 per cent) average, 9 (2.7 per
cent) poor.d 9 (2.7 per cent) poor.

7.3 Use of ICT Products
The respondents were asked to express their level of
use of various ICT products for their study and research
purpose which is depicted in Table 3. Table 3 shows the

8. CONCLUSIONS
The present study investigated the use of ICT-based
products and services by the graduate and postgraduate
students and faculty members of VSSUT. The study
revealed that, most of the respondents of the university
have good knowledge on ICT products and services
which indicates the sound technological environment of
the University. The study further shows that ICT products
like computer, CD/DVD/pen drive, laptop, pocket
internet, LCD projector, scanner, printer, etc. were being
mostly used by the respondents. Due to the
technological-friendly environment of the University, the
respondents are more IT savvy. Use of e-mail for
communication is the most popular ICT-based services

among the respondents. The study also revealed that,
Google is the most conversant and extensively used
search engine among all categories of respondents. The
study identified that library was the most preferred place
for use of ICT products and services among the graduate
and postgraduate students while the faculty members felt
comfortable at computer lab/department while using the
same.
The study has also identified that, graduate and
postgraduate students had their formal education and
training while most of the faculty learned the art of using
ICT products and services through trial and error device.
Regarding the impact of ICT products and services on
study and research, most of the respondents, among all
categories, have considered the impact excellent
followed by good and average in second and third ranks,
