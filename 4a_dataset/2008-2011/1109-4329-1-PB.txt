ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception and use of social networking sites by the
students of Calicut University, Kerala. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from a
representative sample of 150 students. The study found that a majority of the students were aware of social
networking sites and use these sites for friendly communication. Orkut was the most popular and used social
networking site than Facebook and MySpace. A number of students visited social networking sites twice a
week and always send scraps and meet new friends. Though the students indicated that lack of security and
privacy are the main concerns of social networking sites, a majority of them used their real names and photoes
in their profiles.

1. INTRODUCTION
Advances in the World Wide Web (WWW) have
greatly changed the way people access information and
communicate with each other. The evolution of the Web
has led to the development of a collection of technologies
known as Web 2.0. The term Web 2.0 was coined by
O’Reilly Media in 2004 and refers to web applications,
which provide for online collaboration, participation,
social networking, interaction and user-generated
content sharing1-3. Social networking sites are profilebased websites that allow users to maintain social
relationships by viewing, visiting, and sharing their lists of
social connections with other members. These sites can
be used to build community-based personal websites,
online discussions forums, chat rooms and other social
spaces accessible to users for exchange of personal
content and communication4,5. Examples of social
networking sites include Orkut, Facebook, and MySpace.
Social networking sites offer a wide variety of
resources and services such as messaging, blogging,
sharing photos, audios and videos, group discussion,
and distribution of applications. Youngsters, especially
students, are the avid users of these sites. Social

networking sites enable students to get in touch with their
friends, faculty members, and institutions and allow them
to connect with more friends. Students can use these
sites to create and share their identities and profiles that
may include personal information, pictures, blog entries,
videos and music clips. They can join groups and
communicate with other students and faculty members
by commenting on topics or by introducing topics that
they hoped would encourage discussion. They can share
information, exchange files and seek comments, advice,
give opinions, and suggestions, and ideas instantly and
interactively. Students can also use these sites as a
platform to connect with long lost classmates, batchmates
and family members. These sites provide an online
platform for students of diverse backgrounds and
nationalities. Security and privacy are the topmost
concerns of social networking sites. This is mainly
because social networking sites allow members to
display their personal information such as their name,
address, phone number, e-mail, and photo.
The present study is an attempt to understand the
perception and use of social networking sites by the
students of Calicut University. Calicut University is a
295

higher educational institution established on 23 July 1968
with the objective of developing human resources in the
northern districts of Kerala by extending higher
education and promoting research in all areas of
development with particular emphasis on technology, art,
and culture of Kerala.

2. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
There have been a number of research studies on
the use of social networking sites. Park6 studied the use
of social networking sites by undergraduates, graduates,
and faculty members at Yonsei University in Seoul, South
Korea. The analysis indicated that the three groups of
users demonstrated distinct patterns of use of social
networking sites. Although the undergraduates used the
profile service more than the community service,
graduates used the community service more than the
profile service. Most of the faculty members were not
active users. Mikami7, et al. examined online communication on social networking sites in a longitudinal sample
of 92 youths. The study found that youths at age group of
13-14 years based on gender, ethnicity and parental
income were using social networking sites more than at
age group of 20-23 years. Subrahmanyam8, et al.
conducted a study to assess the use of online and offline
social networking sites among the college students of a
large urban university in Los Angeles. The study revealed
that the students often used social networking sites to
connect and reconnect with their friends and family
members.
Pempek, Yermolayeva and Calvert9 studied college
students' social networking experiences on Facebook.
Results of the study revealed that students use Facebook
approximately 30 minute throughout the day as part of
their daily routine. Students communicated on Facebook
using a one-to-many style, in which they were the
creators disseminating content to their friends.
Shaheen10 investigated the use of social networks and
political activism by the students of three universities of
Islamabad and Rawalpindi during the political crises and
the emergency imposed by the Government of Pakistan
on 3 November 2007.
The investigation found that the use of social
networking sites by the students promoted democracy,
freedom of expression, and greater awareness about
their rights during the political crises in Pakistan.
Ellison11, et al. identified relationships between
undergraduates use of Facebook and three types of
social capital. The study revealed that Facebook
enhances social capital formation more through weak
ties than through strong ties and may psychologically
help students increase their life satisfaction and selfesteem. Hargittai12 found that students gender, race,
ethnicity, and parental educational background have
296

significant relationships with the adoption of a social
networking site. Golder, Wilkinson and Huberman13
studied the use of Facebook by US college students. The
study indicated that the students had incorporated the
use of Facebook into their study routines, exchanging
messages with friends, predominantly from the same
college.
Keenan and Shiri14 conducted an exploratory study
on how social networking sites encourage sociability.
Four social networking sites (Facebook, MySpace,
LinkedIn and Twitter) were examined from a users'
perspective. They found that the social networking sites
use a number of different approaches to encourage
sociability amongst their users. While facebook
promotes privacy representing 'real world' networks in a
Web environment, while MySpace promotes publicity
and representing both real world and virtual networks in a
Web environment. LinkedIn and Twitter focus on more
specific aspects of community and technology,
respectively. Pfeil, Arjan and Zaphiris15 investigated age
differences and similarities in the use of the social
networking site, MySpace.
They found that teenagers have larger networks and
friends compared to older users of MySpace. Majority of
teenage users' friends were in their own age range,
whilst older people's network of friends tends to had a
more diverse age distribution. Thelwall16 investigated the
characteristics of social network comments and found
that the comments were normally for general friendship
maintenance and were typically short. They contained a
combination of standard spelling, apparently accidental
mistakes,
slangs,
fragmented
sentences
and
interjections. In general, the use of social networking
sites have been studied and discussed at different levels.
However, there seems to be little research that assesses
the perception and use of social networking sites by
students in developing countries like India. Most of the
studies have been conducted in developed countries.
This study provides an insight into the perception and
use of social networking sites by students in the Calicut
University in India.

3. RESEARCH DESIGN
To meet the main aim and specific objectives of the
study, a quantitative research methodology along with a
comprehensive literature review were employed. The
universe of the study was 867 students of the different
departments of the Calicut University. Structured
questionnaires were employed to collect data from a
representative sample of 150 students. A total of 134 filled
in questionnaires were received back, which comes to an
overall response rate of 89.3 per cent. The data were
analysed and inferences were made based on standard
statistical methods.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
4.1 Awareness About Social Networking Sites
Web-based social networking or online social
networking is a new way of communication on the
Internet. It is a form of interactive communication
between persons or groups of persons or organisations.
The students were asked to indicate the awareness about
social networking sites and the responses have been
summarised in Table 1. The analysis shows that a
majority (75.4 per cent) of the students were aware of
Orkut and YouTube (62.7 per cent). About half (52. 2 per
cent) of the students were aware of Blogs. A good number
of the students were aware of Facebook (38.8 per cent),
and Hi-5 (35.8 per cent). A few (29.1 per cent) students
were aware of MySpace, very few students of
Classmate.com (16.4 per cent), Friendster (11.2 per cent)
and Bebo (6.7 per cent). Only a small per cent of the
students were aware of the sites like Flickr (4.5 per cent),
LinkedIn (3.7 per cent) and Twitter (2.2 per cent).

sources of information are the Internet, teachers, friendsgroups, newspapers, and magazines. The students were
asked to indicate the sources from where they get
information
about
social
networking
sites.
Table 2 shows that a majority (58.9 per cent) of the
students got information about social networking sites
from their friends and a good number (46.3 per cent) of
the students from the Internet. A few (24.6 per cent)
students get information from newspapers and
magazines and only a small percentage (4.5 per cent)
from their teachers. It is found that the students learn
about social networking sites through their friends. They
join in these sites because their friends invite and compel
them to become the members of these sites.

A majority of the students were aware of one or
two social networking sites. Orkut is more popular
among the students than Facebook and MySpace.
Orkut is owned and operated by the Google and its
audience tends to be Asian. These may be the
reasons for the increased popularity of Orkut among
the students. Orkut is more popular in both India and
Brazil17. However, Facebook is more popular among
the students of developed countries like United States
and United Kingdom. Recent data shows that
Facebook is the second most popular website in the
world and its popularity is increasing in India at an
accelerated speed.

4.3 Commonly-used Social Networking Sites
There are different types of social networking sites,
which are commonly used by the student community.
Important social networking sites used by the students
are given in Table 3. It was found that a majority (64.2 per
cent) of the students used Orkut. A good number of the
students used YouTube (35.1 per cent) and Blog (23.1
per cent). A few students use Hi-5 (14.9 per cent),
MySpace (11.2 per cent), Facebook (8.9 per cent),
Friendster (6.7 per cent), Classmate.com (6 per cent),
Flickr (2.2 per cent), Bebo (3 per cent) and LinkedIn (1.8
per cent).
The students were not very much aware of the
educational applications of social networking sites like
YouTube and Blog. Orkut is the most used social

time on social networking sites for posting entries and
comments may affect the academic productivity of
students negatively.

Social networking sites have a wide variety of uses
and students use these sites for various purposes like
friendly communication, publishing, messaging, group
discussion, etc. The students were asked to indicate the
purpose of using social networking sites (Table 4). It
shows that a majority (75.4 per cent) of the students
used social networking sites for friendly communication.
A good number (36.6 per cent) of the students used
these sites for academic communication and for
discussing new ideas and social issues (29.1 per cent).
A few students (11.2 per cent) used social networking
sites to promote their work and to publish their writings

There were variations in the frequency at which the
students visited social networking sites. Some of them
visited these sites every day and some others once a
week. The students were asked how often they visit social
networking sites. Table 6 shows that a good number (41
per cent) of the students visited social networking sites
twice a week. A few students (23.1 per cent) visited every
day, 22.4 per cent once a week and 12.7 per cent less
often.

Purposes

It is clear that a majority of the students used social
networking sites for friendly communication. They
treated social networking sites as a way to connect and
reconnect with friends and relatives. However, a good
number of the students use social networking sites like
Blogs for academic purpose.

4.5 Time Spent on Social Networking Sites
Time spent (Table 5) on social networking sites by
students vary from each other. The impact of these sites
can be assessed by the number of hours spent on these
sites. Table 5 shows that about half (50.7 per cent) of the
students spent less than 2 hours a week on social
networking sites. A good number (29.8 per cent) of the
students spent 2-4 hours in social networking sites. A few
students (8.2 per cent) spent 4-6 hours and more than 6
hours (6.7 per cent) a week in social networking sites.
Lack of the state-of-the-art computer infrastructure
and lack of full-fledged Internet connection may be the
reasons of less time spent on social networking sites by

4.7 Frequency of Using Various Services/
Facilities of Social Networking Sites
The students were asked to indicate the frequency
of use of different services or facilities of social
networking sites (Table 7).
The analysis revealed that 47 per cent of the
students sent scraps and met new friends (37.3 per cent)
using social networking sites. A good number (36.6 per
cent) of the students sent scraps sometimes, met new
friends (32.8 per cent), posted photographs (33.6 per
cent) and comments (39.5 per cent).
A few students responded that they never used
social networking sites to post photographs (11.9 per
cent), find old friends (23.1 per cent), publish writings
(23.9 per cent), and post comments (14.1 per cent). A
very few students indicated that they never sent scraps
(6 per cent) and met new friends (4.5 per cent) using
social networking sites. It was found that the students

The students were asked to indicate the reasons, if
any, to use false names and fake photos in their profiles
(Table 9). The analysis reveals that very few
(21.6 per cent) students used false names and fake
photos due to fear of security, privacy and misuse of
personnel information.

were not active users of various servces of social
networking sites. The frequency of use of various
services and facilities are very low. Meeting new friends
and sending scraps were the frequently used services or
facilities. Lack of awareness may be the reason of the
low frequency of using various services and facilities.

4.8 Names and Photoes Used in Social
Networking Sites
The members of social networking sites can use
fake biographical information, symbolic images, and
false names in their profiles. The students were asked to
indicate the names and photos used in their profiles
(Table 8).

Table 8 shows that majority (61.2 per cent) of the
students used their real names and photos in their
profiles. The students may not be very much aware of the
security and privacy concerns of social networking sites.
Students usually reveal a lot of information about
themselves without knowing the privacy options or who
can view their profiles. This information is accessible to
anyone with an Internet connection. Students need to be
very careful about the personal information they reveal

Very few students used false names and fake
photos due to unwillingness to disclose their identity (5.2
per cent) and for the sake of fun (3.7 per cent). Students
can protect their identity by using false names and
symbolic images. Social networking sites like Facebook
provide improved privacy than MySpace and Orkut.

4.10 Opinion About Social Networking Sites
Students use social networking sites for various
purposes. They were asked to indicate their opinion
about social networking sites (Table 10).

social networking sites are easy way for contacting old
and new friends. About half (50.7 per cent) of the
students have the opinion that these sites are helpful for
easy communication and for communicating with many
(47.8 per cent). A few (10.4 per cent) students have the
opinion that it is useful for academic communication.

4.11 Problems Faced while Using Social
Networking Sites
Students were asked to indicate problems/constrains
faced, if any, while using social networking sites (Table
11). A good number (48.5 per cent) of the students
indicated security and privacy, fear of misusing their
personal information (39.5 per cent), and lack of time
(37.3 per cent) as the concerns while using social
networking sites. Twenty-nine (21. 6 per cent) students
indicated that non-availability of the full-fledged Internet
facility in the departments prevent them from using social
networking sites effectively.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The results of the study show that a majority of the
students were aware of social networking sites and use
these sites for friendly communication. However, a good
number of students use these sites for academic
purpose also. It should be noted that social networking
sites can be used as an interactive platform for academic
communication and can be a source of information,
knowledge and help. Orkut is the most used social
networking site by the students of Calicut University.
Although there are many resources and services
available through these sites, there are also many
concerns. Security and privacy are the topmost
concerns while using these sites. However, a majority of
the students still used their real names, photoes, and
biographical information in their profiles.
Social networking website companies need to
improve the security and privacy of their sites. They
should establish policies and strategies for the proper
and safe use of personal information posted on their
sites. Students may share copyrighted materials such as
videos, music, photos and other documents. Social
networking sites should protect the misuse of
copyrighted materials.
Students should not disclose personal information to
strangers. They should work in accordance with strict
and safe computing practices. They can protect their
privacy by putting up fake biographical information and
images, making the profile private and for friends only.
They can also use social networking sites that provide
300

better privacy and facilities to present highly
customisable personal information. Training and
awareness programmes should be given to educate
students about the applications, benefits, and risks
associated with social networking sites.
