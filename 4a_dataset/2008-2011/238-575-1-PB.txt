ABSTRACT
The paper is a finding of a study of the social sciences researchers use of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) in the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). A well-structured questionnaire was used to collect
the data. The study shows that researchers use a variety of ICT products and services for their research
work as these products prove very helpful in finding needed information quickly and easily and also help the
researchers to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create, and communicate information more easily. The
study also identifies lack of training and technical knowledge to use ICTs as the major hindrances faced by
the researchers in AMU. The paper recommends proper training and guidance for use of ICT-based technologies
for the optimum utilisation of these services by the researchers.
Keywords: ICT, information technology, Internet, researchers, AMU

1. INTRODUCTION
Academic libraries for centuries have played
important role in supporting research in all subjects and
disciplines within their host universities and colleges. But
the last decade has brought a sea change in relationships
between researchers and libraries. Information and
communication technology (ICT)enabled products and
services, and the availability of online information
resources have changed the way the services academic
institutions and libraries now provide to their researchers.
ICT is the integration of computer and communication
technology used to process, store and disseminate
information. It has changed the traditional practices of
library and information centres in delivery of services to
the end users. Now researchers can have access to a
variety of information and scholarly journals online. It also
helps the researchers to access, manage, integrate,
evaluate, create, and communicate information more
easily than ever. Significant developments in ICT have
forever changed the way information is gathered,
processed and disseminated. While processing, storage
and retrieval facilities are provided by computers,
telecommunications provide the facilities for the transfer
or communication of data or information. Dilevko and
Harris2 have reported how the traditional library is
undergoing significant changes due to the electronic
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(2)

revolution, which in its various manifestations has affected
nearly every aspects of information provision. The ICT has
nowadays become an important technology in academic
institutions as it plays a very important role in meeting
information needs of the researchers and institution as a
whole.
Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) is a residential
academic institution of international repute and offering
more than 250 courses in traditional and modern branch
of knowledge. Modeled on the pattern of Oxford and
Cambridge, the AMU was established in 1920. This is a
premier Central University, which draws students from all
corners of the world, especially Africa, West Asia and
South East Asia. AMU is situated at a distance of 130 km
South East of Delhi on Delhi-Calcutta railway and Grand
Trunk road.3
The presence of the ICT at the AMU has changed the
teaching, learning and research environment. ICT is
playing a vital role in meeting information and
communication needs of the research scholars of the
university. Students have access to Internet at various
points such as Maulana Azad Central Library, Computer
Centre as well as the departments and departmental
laboratories. Students and staff of the university can now
access a wide range of journal databases in various
25

academic disciplines. Such access includes full-text
journal articles, abstracting and indexing services. To
access the scholarly literature, relevant URLs and
passwords are provided as and when needed.

2. LITERATURE SURVEY
According to Kooganurmath and Jange4 a majority of
the users use Internet for communication followed by the
access to information. More than 70 per cent of the users
use Internet for higher studies and only 39 per cent use it
for discussions with peer groups. The most used services
of Internet are e-mail, the Web, discussion forums and
FTP. Mishra, Yadav and Bisht5 have shown in a study
that 67.7 per cent of Internet users were male and 32.3
per cent were female students. Their study also showed
that 61.5 per cent of the male and 51.6 per cent of the
female used Internet for preparing assignments.
Shaheen Majid6 investigated the relationship between
computer literacy of academic staff and their use of
electronic information sources. The impact of other
factors such as age, gender and educational background
on the use of electronic information sources was also
investigated. They found statistically significant
relationship between computer literacy and the use of
electronic information sources and services. A significant
relationship was also noted between the age of
academics and their use of electronic information
sources.
Amritpal Kaur7 in her study revealed that more than
60 per cent of the respondents used Internet for primary
information, 38 per cent for secondary, and only 15 per
cent for consulting OPACs. A majority of the respondents,
i.e., 75.6 per cent faced the problem of slow Internet
connectivity. All respondents used search engines to
browse the required information. More than one third of
the respondents typed the web addresses directly, more
than 80 per cent of the respondents felt that in
comparison to traditional documents, Internet is time
saving, easy to use, more informative, useful and more
preferred.
Asemi8 in a study reported that 55 per cent of
respondents search for scientific information through
Internet because their university library provides access
to various databases and online journals. Internet was
also used by the respondents for downloading software or
text, chatting, discussion, e-mail services, and for finding
related references. She also observed that the Google
and Yahoo search engines were more widely used
compared to other search engines. Her study revealed
that 54 percent of Internet users always find useful
information on the net. Thirty-one percent of respondents
believed that quality information is available on the
Internet and 35 per cent of the studied population used
26

print, online and offline form of information for updating
their subject knowledge.
Adogbeji and Akporhonor9 explored how students are
increasingly using the Internet to support instruction and
research needs in addition to e-mail usage. Their findings
reveal that students are now coming to university with
more technological background.

3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the study were:
(i)

To find out the level of use and purpose of using
various ICT products and services.

(ii) To know the frequency of use of ICTs and time spent.
(iii) To find out the level of expertise of users regarding
the use of ICTs.
(iv) To determine how ICT has impacted research work.
(v)

To find out the problems faced by the users while
using ICTs.

4. METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED
This study used questionnaire to collect the data
from researchers. Ninety questionnaires were personally
distributed among the randomly selected researchers of
the faculty of social sciences at the university campus,
out of which 55 (61.11) filled questionnaires were received
back. Overall 33 (60 per cent) respondents were male and
22 (40 per cent) female. The well structured questionnaire
comprised the following questions: use of ICT products
and services, purpose for which these ICT products and
services was used, frequency of use of computer and
Internet, place of use of Internet, their level of expertise in
using ICT, preferred search engines, problems faced while
using ICT, how they learned to use ICT and major impact
of ICT on their research work. The collected data was
analyzed, classified and tabulated by employing
statistical methods.

5. FINDINGS
5.1 Use of ICT Products
Respondents were asked to express their level of use
of various ICT products for their research work. Table 1
show that 93.33 per cent male and 90.90 per cent female
researchers used computer for their research work. A
majority of male (84.84 per cent) and female researchers
(81.81 per cent) used Internet. As far as various
application software are concerned, it was found that
while 57.57 per cent male researchers used MS Word,
30.30 per cent used MS PowerPoint, and 33.33 per cent

5.2 Purpose of Using ICT Products and
Services
Researchers were asked to indicate the purpose for
which they used various ICT products and services.
Table 2 show that 84.84 per cent male researchers used
e-mail and document exchange; 90.90 per cent for
electronic journals; 84.84 per cent to locate and collect
data; 78.78 per cent for online databases; 78.78 per cent
for career development; 75.75 per cent for preparing
manuscripts, proposals and papers; 87.87 per cent to
update knowledge; 84.84 per cent for blogging; and 93.93
per cent for casual internet surfing. As far as female
researchers are concerned 86.36 per cent used ICT
products for e-mail and document exchange; 81.81 per
cent for electronic journals; 72.72 per cent to locate and
collect data; 68.18 per cent for online databases; 63.63
per cent for career development; 72.72 per cent for
preparing manuscripts, proposals, and papers; 77.27 per
cent to update knowledge; 31.81 per cent for blogging;
and 90.90 per cent for casual internet surfing and other
data. The less used services among both male and
female researchers were Web OPAC/OPAC, blogging,
and electronic books. The investigators feel that the
researchers might not have got proper training/guidance
and assistance from the staffs/librarians which is very
necessary for the effective use of ICT products and
services.

5.3 Frequency of Use of Computer and the
Internet
To find out the frequency of use of internet the time
gap was divided into five categories, viz., daily, two to
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(2)

proposals, and papers

three times, weekly, monthly, and occasionaly. Figure 1
shows that 42.42 per cent male and 45.46 per cent female
researchers used internet daily; 18.19 per cent and 27.27
per cent male and female for two to three times in a week;
and 24.24 per cent male and 9.09 per cent female weekly.
A few researchers used it monthly and occasionally.

5.4 Place of Use of Internet
The AMU provides access to the Internet to its users
at various places within the campus. Users are given
Athens login for using the Internet. At the departmental
lab they can access the Internet without login and
password. At some places like library and university
computer centre, this facility is provided at late night also.
Table 3 indicates that 81.81 per cent male and 86.36 per
cent female researchers of social sciences access
internet at library. While 48.48 per cent male and 54.54
per cent female researchers use it at the university
computer centre.
The reasons why the majority of the researchers of
the Faculty of Social Sciences access Internet at the
central library be the proximity of the library to the
Faculty. Besides, majority of the departments in the
Faculty of Social Sciences are not well equipped with this
facility.

The questionnaire asked the researcher to indicate
their overall expertise in handling various types of ICTs.
Figure 2 shows that only 18.18 per cent male researchers
and 22.72 per cent female researchers indicated that they
are very expert in using ICTs, while 27.27 per cent male
and 22.72 per cent female indicated that they are expert
users of ICT. Forty per cent male and 32 per cent female
researchers indicated that they are average users of ICTs.
The reasons for less expertise in using ICTs is that a
majority of the researchers in the Faculty of Social
Sciences do not have a formal knowledge or a computer
training programme.

As far as awareness regarding the various ICT
products is concerned 51.51 per cent male and 63.63 per
cent female researchers indicated that lack of awareness
of ICTs is also one of the major hindrances faced by the
researchers to use the new technologies. Besides,
financial constraints and lack of time in searching for
information in the Internet as service is related to how you
pay were some other problems researchers face while
useing ICT-based products and services.

The study revealed that major hindrances faced by
the male researchers are lack of training (87.87 per cent),
lack of technical knowledge (75.75 per cent) and limited
number of computers (57.57 per cent). Female
researchers indicated that they also faced same
problems in terms of lack of training (90.90 per cent), lack
of technical knowledge (77.27 per cent), and limited
number of computers (63.63 per cent).

6. CONCLUSION

of the male researchers learned to use ICTs by guidance
from colleagues, 75.75 per cent by guidance from staff,
66.66 per cent by trial and error, and only 39.39 per cent
have formal training. A good majority of 86.36 per cent
female researchers also learned through guidance from
colleagues, 77.27 per cent by guidance from staff, and
59.09 per cent by trial and error. Only 36.36 per cent
female researchers have formal training. It is evident from
the analyses that majority of the researchers learned to
use ICTs through the guidance from colleagues and staff.

The study investigated the use of ICT by the research
scholars at the Faculty of Social Science at AMU. Study
found that respondents used a variety of ICT products and
services for their research work as it is helpful in finding
information quickly and also helps the researchers to
access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create, and
communicate information more easily. The study reveals
that 93.33 per cent male and 90.90 per cent female
researchers use computer for their research work. The
study identified that researchers are not getting proper
training/guidance and assistance from the staffs/
librarians, which is very necessary for the effective use of
ICT products and services. The library should arrange and
organise training programmes related to ICT.

5.9 Impact of ICTs on Research Work
The ICT has proved to be a great asset to many of the
social sciences researchers of AMU. Figure 5 shows that

The study also identifies that major hindrances faced
by the male researchers as well as female researchers
are lack of training, lack of technical knowledge and
limited number of computers. It was further found that
lack of awareness of ICTs is also one of the major
hindrances to use the new technologies. Majority of the
researchers learned to use ICTs through the guidance
from colleagues and staff. Therefore, it is recommended
that library should provide initial orientation workshops
and training for the researchers on ICT-based services so
that they can utilise these technologies to optimum level.
