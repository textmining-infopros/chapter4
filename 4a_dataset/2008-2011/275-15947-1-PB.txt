ABSTRACT
NOIDA is emerging as an international hub of R&D institutions in all sectors. In past no such research
study has been conducted on the use and applications of information communication technologies (ICT) in
library and information centres (LICs) in the NOIDA city. Hence, the need was felt to undertake an in-depth
study on the various aspects of the ICT use and applications. The study provides a current state-of-the-art
report on use and applications of ICT in LICs. The study also identifies the causes and problems that hindered
ICT applications in the LICs and their possible solutions. The study is an outcome of a research project jointly
undertaken by the authors, explores and evaluates the use and availability of ICTs in the LICs of NOIDA. The
study is based on 25 LICs from the different sectors such as public, government, corporate, public enterprises,
and private. The data was collected through a structured questionnaire and distributed personally as well
through mail/e-mail among the librarians of selected institutions. The study finds that majority of the LICs of
NOIDA have the basic hardware facilities such as servers, computers, printers, photocopier, Internet connectivity,
etc., except one library, i.e., Network Programs library. About half of the LICs have better hardware facilities
including scanner, barcode printer, barcode scanner, etc., but the hardware facilities in the majority of LICs
are not being properly utilized because majority of the library professionals are not properly aware of the
use and operations of the hardware.
Keywords: Information and communication technology, ICT applications, ICT use, Noida libraries

INTRODUCTION

The present century is the age of digital nervous
system, which aims at leveraging the two-core
revolutions-PC and the Internet [1]. The recent
advancement in the information processing and
dissemination, storage and communication technologies
have revolutionized the role of the libraries and information
centres all over the world. As a result, LICs are facing new
challenges, new competitors, new demands, and variety
of information services. To meet the new challenges and
multifaceted information needs of the users, LICs are reconsolidating, re-shaping, and re-designing their
information services and products by incorporating new
tools and technologies, upgrading information resources,
and training library and information professionals. Huge
amount of information is being generated every moment in
various forms such as printed materials (books,
periodicals, conference proceedings, technical reports,
Received on 31 July 2009

standards and patents, etc.), offline (floppies, audio
tapes, CD-Rom, DVDs, pen drives, etc.) and online
(Web).
Information is a dynamic and unending resource
that affects all disciplines and all walks of life hence, the
information becomes an essential ingredient of our life
and a basic input to education, research, planning, and
development activities. LICs have been greatly influenced
by the development and applications of ICT and the users
have been greatly benefited by such applications. In the
recent past, various studies have been conducted on use
and applications of ICT in library and information centres.
Gulati [2] conducted a research study entitled Use of
Information and Communication Technology in Libraries
and Information Centers: An Indian Scenario , and pointed
that the status of usage in Indian libraries, with special
reference to special libraries, and the efforts made by
various institutions to propagate e-information products

and services. This paper highlighted the consortia efforts
in India like JCCC Consortium, INDEST Consortium, CSIR
E-journal Consortia, and UGC Infonet. It further discussed
digitization efforts in India at NISCAIR, New Delhi, IIITM,
Kerala, C-DAC Pune, and the Digital Library of India. In
addition it highlighted details on major information
systems in India such as NISSAT and major library
networks in India, such as INFLIBNET, DELNET, and
CALIBNET etc. The paper also drew attention to
challenges for library and information science
professionals, and an overview of initiatives taken by
Government of India. Singh [3], in an another study on
Library Automation , discussed the various aspects
related to library automation such as need and purpose of
automation, advantages of automation, criteria for
selection of library software, and possible area of
automation in LICs. Study also highlights the salient
features of important library software packages, i.e.,
Libsys, SOUL, Alice for Windows, SLIM++, Tech Lib
Plus, LIBSUITE, CDS/ISIS, and SUCHIKA.
Singh [4] conducted a study entitled Application of
the Information and Communication Technology in the
Libraries and Information Centers of the DRDO and the
CSIR located at Delhi . These libraries are: the Defence
Science Library of DESIDOC; Laser and Science
Technology Centre (LASTEC); Institute of System
Studies and Analysis (ISSA); Solid State Physics
Laboratory (SSPL); Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied
Sciences (INMAS); Defense Institute of Physiological and
Allied Sciences (DIPAS); Defense Institute of
Psychological Research (DIPR); National Science Library
of National Institute of Science Communication and
Information Resources (NISCAIR); National Institute of
Science, Technology and Development Studies
(NISTADS); the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI);
and the institute of Genomes and Integrated Biology
(IGIB) Library. For the study data was collected through
questionnaires and further supplemented with interviews
for clarity of the facts. The questionnaire sent to the
librarians included various aspects of the libraries with
particular reference to ICT applications. Singh presented
the data in 10 tables with their interpretation and the
findings.

Kaul [6] while working on a research study entitled
Resource Sharing and Networking in India discusses
the various facets of resource sharing and library
networking such as, library networks, Resource Sharing
tools, and resource sharing technology. Further, he
describes the manpower needs, user needs, and the
library network problems. The studies conducted by
Sloan [7], Summerhill [8], Kaul [9], also discusses the
importance of networking technology in libraries, tools,
manpower requirements, and major hurdles in operation
of networks and their scientific solutions.

METHODOLOGY

A structured questionnaire was developed for the
purpose of data collection and distributed personally as
well through mail/e-mail among the librarians of selected
institutions. While designing the questionnaire due care
was given to make it comprehensive by including all
essential components without sacrificing the objectivity of
the study. Some Librarians who were unable to supply the
desired data through questionnaire were personally
contacted. The collected data was analysed using latest
version of MS-Excel for appropriate statistical analysis
and description.

DISCUSSIONS AND FINDINGS

The outcome of the study has been presented in the
following tables and diagrams with their interpretation:

5.1. Libraries Profile
The first section of the questionnaire was designed
to obtain the basic information (such as type of library
head of the LICs, membership and budget) about the LICs
of Noida (Table 1). Table 1 shows that out of the 26 LICs
17 belongs to private sectors while other belongs to
government, public enterprises, and media houses. It was
also found that only five LICs were headed by female
professionals, which reflect a gender gap especially on
the top positions in the LIS profession.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(6)

The provisions of budget in the LICs of Noida were
not found uniform in terms of budget allocation. This is
due to the nature, size, and type of libraries. While
Jaypee Institute of Information Technology and IEC
College Libraries have the unlimited library budget, TCS
Library has the compound budget with the parent
organisation for purchasing of books, periodicals and
other reading materials. These libraries spent 60 per cent
of the allocated budget for subscribing the scientific and
technical journals and subject related databases. The
table 1 also shows that 50 per cent LICs have more than
1000 users whereas only three LICs namely GIMT, GIT,
Network Programs library have less than 200 users.

Table 2 indicates that the LICs of Noida have a rich
library collection in their respective subjects in printed
form. It was further also found that majority of the LICs are
subscribing the online journals, audio video databases as
well as CD-ROM databases. Most of the institutional
libraries have substantial collection of theses/
dissertations and project reports. Table 2 shows that there
is a remarkable impact of the ICT on creation,
preservation and distribution of the digital contents in few
LICs of Noida. These libraries belong to Jaypee Institute of
Information Technology, VV Giri National Labour Institute,
Amity Business School, GAIL Training Institute, Birla
Institute of Management and Technology, Galgotia s
College of Engineering, Greater Noida. Majority of the
LICs were found subscribing the Indian as well as foreign
journals in their disciplines for meeting the information
needs of their users.

5.3 Staff Profile
Library staff is the key component for discharging
the effective LIS services and managing library resources.
Table 3 shows that there is a big variation among staffs in
the LICs. This is due to the size, stature and nature of the
LICs. The JSS Academy of Technical Education Library
has maximum number of LIS professionals followed by
the Jaypee Institute of Information Technology Library,
JIIT-Learning Resource Centre, and Amity Business
School Library. Some of the LICs such as Jaipuria
Institute of Management, and NTPC Engineering, NTPC
Power Management Institute do not have nonprofessional staff in the library, therefore, the LIS staff is
performing all those activities which are generally
performed by the non-library professionals.

5.4 Infrastructure Profile
Since the hardware infrastructure is the basic
components of ICT, which enables integration of the
software packages in operations of various LIS activities.
Table 4 shows that majority of LICs of NOIDA have the
basic infrastructure facilities except Network Programs
Library. It also shows that GAIL Training Institute Library,

5.5 Software Profile
Software packages/application programmes are
considered as blood of the hardware system, which

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(6)

brings users and equipment into real use. Table 5 shows
about the various kinds of software available in the LICs of
Noida. Majority of the LICs are using MS Word for word
processing and Windows XP and Windows 2000 as
operating system. Table 5 also indicates that for
managing the library majority of the LICs were using
commercial developed software such as Alice for
Windows, Libsuit, Vidya, and Nettlib except C-DAC
which is using in-house developed library software. Few
LICs namely Jaypee Institute of Information Technology,
JSS Academy of Technical Education and Birla Institute
of Management and Technology were using the open
source digital library software

5.6 Automation Profile
Computerisation of library holdings is the first line
use and application of the ICT in the LICs. Table 6 shows
the status of the automation activities among the LICs of

Noida. The study shows that majority of the LICs have
started their automation activities from 2000 onwards
except NRD Resource Centre. Majority of the LICs are
also automated except few. Further, it was also noticed
that Libsys, commercially developed library software, is
being used by majority of the LICs followed by Alice for
Windows, CDS/ISIS, Vidya, Nettlib, and in-house
developed software.

5.7 Use of ICT in Housekeeping Activities
The housekeeping activities/operations of any LIC
are the preliminary computer-based activities on which all
the ICT-based LIS services depend. Table 7 shows that
the majority of the LICs of Noida except the LICs of AMITY
Institute of Bio Technology, Mahatma Gandhi Mission s
College of Engineering and Technology, and Noida Public
Library and Network Programs were found using ICT in all
housekeeping activities, i.e., acquisition, (ordering and

BARRIERS TO ICT APPLICATIONS IN LICS

While conducting the study, opinions regarding
barriers to application of ICT in the library were sought by
the librarians. In response to the questions, viz., lack of
awareness, interest and initiation of library professionals
towards ICT application it was found that majority of the
librarians were agreed with these facts that lack of
awareness, interest and initiation of library professionals
towards ICT application in the library are the major
bottlenecks of ICT application in the LICs.

Application of ICT

In response to another questions, viz., lack of wellaccepted and standard library software package is also a
barrier to ICT application in LICs , a sizeable number of the
librarians
strongly
argued
that
substandard/
incompatibility among library software packages, is also
a major barrier to ICT application in LICs. In response to

ICT-based LIS services are efficient and effective
mechanism of delivering the digital contents pin-pointedly
and exhaustively. ICT-based LIS services are the cost
effective and user-friendly for meeting the information
needs of users. Table 9 shows that majority of the LICs of

technology in the libraries and information centres of
the Defence Research and Development Organization

located at Delhi: A study. Library Herald, 2004, 42(4),

ATTITUDE TOWARDS APPLICATION OF
ICT IN LICS

The attitudinal questions were carefully analyzed
and interpreted and it was found that in majority, the
attitude of the librarians towards ICT application/use in the
LICs was very positive. The librarians have overwhelmingly
showed their positive attitude towards the applications/
use of ICT in their libraries knowingly that if they use/
implement these technologies in their libraries it would
not only improve the status of the library but also improve
the quality and efficiency of the library services and
resources.

8.

CONCLUSION

The effective use and application of ICT in LICs
helps in performing their operations and services
efficiently and effectively. Application of ICT in the LICs of
Noida has become inevitable on account of information
explosion and widespread use of digital information. This
study provides the current scenario of ICT application in
LICs in Noida. The majority of LICs in Noida has good
hardware and software facilities to some extent but ICTbased services and products are not reaching the users to
the extent expected due to the problems of inadequate
finance, infrastructure, and trained library professionals
leaving available ICT infrastructure underutilized.
Therefore, it is essential that ICT resources should be
enhanced; ICT skilled staff should be increased or trained
in using and handling ICT. The study pointed out that
majority of the staff working in the selected LICs has
shown positive inclination toward adoption/application of
ICT. The study recommends that LICs of Noida should
give the priority to digital library initiatives, consortia-
