ABSTRACT
The paper describes ongoing work which involves examining the information use pattern of the legal
professionals of District Court. The findings indicate that practicing lawyers were using a variety of information
sources to satisfy their information needs. Respondents preferred to first consult their personal library before
resorting to other information providing sources and agencies This group of district court lawyers often found
it difficult to find the information they were looking for when using digital law libraries. The present study
observed that majority of respondents were not aware of e-resources. On the whole, respondents perceived
district Bar library collections, services and facilities as adequate to meet their information needs effectively.
Keywords: Information use pattern, information needs, bar library, law reports, e-resources

1. INTRODUCTION
India became an independent democratic republic in
1947 and its constitution, which came into force on 26th
November 1949, is the supreme law. India has a
common legal system whose infrastructure bears the
influence of British colonial rule. The constitution is
based on the Government of India Act 1935 passed by
British Parliament. The Indian Constitution lays out a
federal Union of 28 States, 6 union territories and 1
national capital territory. The Union and States have
separate executive and legislative branches, whereas
the union territories are ruled by national government.
Law generated by the Union is superior to that of the
States. The judiciary, however, is independent and not
federal in structure. The nominal head of the Union
executive is an elected President but the Prime Minister,
leader of the majority party and head of the Union
Council of Ministers, is more politically powerful. India
has a bicameral Parliament whose upper house is the
Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and whose lower house
is the House of People (Lok Sabha). The State executive
is headed by a Governor and most have a unicameral
legislative body called the Legislative Assembly, but
some are bicameral with a Legislative Council as well.
The highest appellate court of the judiciary is the
Supreme Court of India, which often decides the
Received: 10 August 2009; Revised: 04 November 2009

legislative powers demarcated by the Constitution for
Union and States. Prior to independence, the highest
appellate court was the Privy Council in London and its
decisions can still be binding unless overruled by the
Supreme Court. High Courts are situated in each State,
with subordinate criminal and civil courts. Apart from the
English influence, personal laws are frequently based on
Hindu and Muslim laws. Hindu law has been codified
and the Muslim law is based on authoritative
commentaries and precedents. The kind of information
required by the user, the ways and means used for
searching for the required information, the use of the
information obtained, the satisfaction/dissatisfaction
arising from the use of information obtained, the flow of
the information and the relationship of the user with the
system (information provider)–all come under the purview
of user studies. User study is the means for systematic
examination of the characteristics and behaviour of the
users of the systems and services. It is directly linked
with the effectiveness (performance) of library and
information services as these aim at satisfaction of user
needs.

1.1 Information Needs
Maurice B. Line has defined information need as,
“what an individual ought to have for his work, his
59

research, his edification, his recreation, etc”. Ching-Chih
Chen and Peter Hernon stress that an information need
is more than a question asked of an information provider.
It occurs whenever people find themselves in situations
that require some form of knowledge for resolution. The
Librarian’s Thesaurus defines information need as “that
need which library services or materials are intended to
satisfy”.

1.2 Methods of Determining Information
Needs
According to Soper, community analysis is one
method used by librarians to identify characteristics of a
target population and to decide what library services and
information would be most appropriate for them. The
techniques that are used in community analysis include
observing environmental characteristics, studying
demographics, observing patterns of library use and
interviewing key informants.
Roger Greer and Martha Hale too support
community analysis as the basis for determining a
library’s role. Their method involves data collection and
analysis from four perspectives; demographics,
community organisations, service-and-product-providing
agencies, and lifestyles.
Brenda Dervin’s sense-making methodology is one
of the most widely adopted techniques for conducting
needs assessments. The researcher tries to find out,
with the help of timeline interviews, about the efforts put
in by an individual to acquire information to bridge a gap
in a particular critical incident.
Robert Grover has presented a conceptual model for
diagnosing information needs in the context of a school
library media programme. He proposed a two-stage
process; systematic analysis of both the school and the
community followed by one-on-one interaction with a
user at the point when he or she has decided to seek
information, i.e., the reference interview. He asserted
that the reference interview can become a vehicle for
diagnosing information needs by applying knowledge of
information psychology—how individuals seek, acquire,
organise, process, utilise, and store information.

1.4 Factors Affecting Information Needs
As found by Lin and Garve by far, the most important
factor that affects the information needs of an individual
is the type of work in which he is involved. Another factor
(relating to type of work), is whether the work is basic or
applied. The discipline within which an individual is
working also affects his information needs. For example,
the information needs of researchers in the pure
sciences is probably more urgent than that of
researchers in the social sciences, because science is
ever growing. The scientist will need to constantly
update his knowledge, i.e., he has to catch up with the
latest developments. Other factors include social,
political, economic and legal.

1.5 Information-seeking Behaviour
When a need is felt for anything, more often than
not, people take action to satisfy that need. Different
strategies or modes of action are resorted to. The same
applied for the satisfaction of information needs. An
individual realises that he needs information, he knows
that in all probability the information will not come to him
on its own, therefore he has go to about seeking it.
What strategies or processes he resorts to, to satisfy
the need for information, is the focus of study here.
According to Girija Kumar, “Information seeking
behaviour is mainly concerned with who needs what kind
of information for what reasons; how information is
found, evaluated and used”. T.D. Wilson defines what he
calls ‘information behaviour’ as, “those activities a
person may engage in when identifying his or her own
needs for information, searching for such information in
any way, and using or transferring that information”.

1.6 The Information-seeking Process
Girija Kumar’s presentation of the information
seeking process is as follows:
(i) Identifying objective.
(ii) Defining need.
(iii) Assessing information systems.

1.3 Types of Information Needs

(iv) Establishing sources of information.

Tague has presented the following types of
information needs:

(v) Information acquisition.

±

Social or pragmatic information needs-required for
coping with day-to-day life.

±

Recreation information needs.

±

Professional information needs.

±

Educational information needs.

60

(vi) Use of information.
(vii) Satisfaction/Dissatisfaction.
According to Mayrice B. Line, all people are
individuals and they will seek and use information in
different ways. Much of our daily time is spent in
information gathering and sifting of one kind or another;
merely looking at people involves an information
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

process, since we notice things about them and do a
rapid assessment. Most of this information gathering is
carried out automatically, and is not perceived as such;
it is an integral part of our personalities and we all do it
differently. There is no such thing as a homogeneous
body of information users. A group of people with the
same level of education may be working on the same
subject at the same time; but they will use information
in different ways. Some to only one or two. Some of the
group will scan and absorb vast quantities of material,
others will read much less. Some will be content with
abstracts or many articles, some will not. Some will
prefer oral channels, some will prefer to see information
in print so that they can pore over it; some always prefer
to ask other people; some prefer to avoid people
whenever they can. Some like browsing, some find it a
waste of time and energy. Some enjoy computer
searching, some have technophobia; and when people
do search they use the Internet in very different ways.

1.7 Factors Affecting the Information Seeking
Behaviour
Social factors: A desire for information on such topics as
sex education, fashion, music, (openly available in other
societies), may not be looked upon kindly in certain
societies (read ‘closed’ societies) as a result of which
an individual may have to resort to stealthy means for
acquiring the information.
Political factors: The political system (particular those
uder dictarship) may define certain types of information
(defence, freedom of speech, of expression, rights, etc.)
as forbidden to particular groups or to the public as a
whole, consequently, the non availability of such
information may motivate a person to resort to
‘underground’ (in the government’s opinion)means.
Geographical factors: The geographical location of an
individual also decides how he goes about seeking
information. Geographical isolation may lead a person to
resort to uncommon means of seeking information.
Educational factors: The educated and uneducated
people may have differing methods of seeking
information; the educated person resorting to more
formal means (information systems) while the
uneducated one depending more on informal methods
(i.e. other people).

2. LEGAL PROFESSION IN INDIA
India’s legal fraternity was at one time the admiration
of the world. The best minds gravitated towards it, and
both the Bench and the Bar dazzled with an
incandescence that was out of this world. India’s
struggle for Independence was waged and won by
stalwarts of the profession. All the freedom heroes—
Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

Patel, C.Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, S.
Satyamurti, C. Subramaniam and others who sacrificed
their all for the country—were lawyers.
That was not all. Many of the luminaries of that
profession were also members of India’s Constituent
Assembly, taking a leading part in framing what
undoubtedly is one of the best written Constitutions of
the world. Dr B.R. Ambedkar, whose monumental
contribution to constitution-making has justifiably made
him one of the venerated immortals of India’s history,
was ably assisted by the likes of Alladi Krishnaswami
Iyer, Tej Bahadur Sapru, and K. M. Munshi who were
themselves the resplendent stars of the legal firmament.
India has the world’s second largest legal profession
with around 1,020,000 lawyers. The predominant service
providers are individual lawyers, small or family-based
firms. Most of the firms are involved in the issues of
domestic law and majority work under country’s
adversarial litigation system. The conception of legal
services as a ‘noble profession’ rather than services
resulted in formulation of stringent and restrictive
regulatory machinery. These regulations have been
justified on the grounds of public policy and ‘dignity of
profession’. The judiciary has reinforced these principles
which can be reflected in words of Justice Krishna Iyer,
when he noted “Law is not a trade, not briefs, not
merchandise, and so the heaven of commercial
competition should not vulgarise the legal profession”.
However, over the years courts have recognised ‘legal
service’ as a ‘service’ rendered to the consumers and
have held that lawyers are accountable to the clients in
the cases of deficiency of services. In the case of
Srimathi vs. Union of India, Madras High Court held that
in view of Section 3 of Consumer Protection Act, 1986
consumer redressal forums have jurisdiction to deal with
claims against advocates. Section 2 (u) of Competition
Act, 2002 defines the term ‘service’ along the lines of
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Thus, it may be
concluded that legal services are becoming subject of
trade related laws where consumerism and market
forces should be given adequate space.

3. REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Many existing design, focused studies of lawyers’
information behaviour, have focused on the design of
systems and tools for information use and re-use rather
than information-seeking. For example, Blomberg, et al.
designed an electronic filing cabinet prototype for a
Silicon Valley law firm1. The authors collaborated with a
business division within the company that was involved
in developing products that bridged paper and electronic
documents and incorporated new approaches for
searching, using and re-using electronic documents.
Hence, the design work focused on the retrieval of
previous documents and was based on scanned
61

versions of documents from the frequently accessed
folders in a particular lawyer’s actual filing cabinet.
Similarly, Marshall, et al. designed an e-book prototype
to act as a wireless access device to information
resources as well as support a wide range of
readingrelated activities such as annotation2. This device
was designed by observing law students prepare for
Moot Court (a mock legal trial).
Komlodi and Soergel also focused on information
use and reuse, specifically legal information-seekers’
use of own memory and electronic search histories to
inform their later searches3. They developed a set of
interface tools to support the recording, categorisation,
and annotation of search results (along with other
aspects of legal work such as note-taking, document
drafting and knowledge-modelling).
Bane and Melheim investigated the use of Internet
by academics4. A questionnaire was sent through the
Internet to 231 randomly selected discussion groups. A
total of 15,361 questionnaires were returned through email. Results of the survey disclosed that personal email was utilised extremely often, more than once a
week by nearly 90 per cent of the respondents.
Discussion groups were accessed more than once a
week by 75 per cent of the respondents. Electronic
journals were accessed far less frequently more than
once a week by 23 per cent of the respondents. The
survey also disclosed that many academics were still
not fully aware of available Internet resources and their
applications. Many studies in developing countries have
also confirmed these findings (Al-Shanbari and
Meadows5; Reid6). Abdullah7 noted that most of the
libraries in Malaysia have yet to utilise the full potential
of the Internet, although it has been available for the last
several years.
Sethi used a questionnaire to study the informationseeking behaviour of 256 social science faculty
members in Indian universities8. It was found that
respondents preferred journals, books, government
documents, and reference sources for meeting their
information needs. The study also revealed lesser use of
indexing and abstracting sources, book reviews,
conference proceedings, dissertations and theses,
newspaper clippings and other non-book sources.
However, Prasad noted that in addition to journal
articles, non-traditional literature such as unpublished
conference and symposia papers, research proposals,
policy guidelines, and project reports were equally
popular among the scholars9.
Ormes, Sarha and Dempsey, Lorcan identified that
93 per cent of all authorities using the Internet use the
common internet information access tools like www, and
Gopher (91 per cent) use e-mail10. Reference staff are
62

the most users of Internet services, followed by IT staff,
and senior management. And the actual network
behaviour most heavily reported was exploration and
experimentation, followed by reference work.
Osorio, N.L. showed that in general the current
design of home pages for science-engineering libraries
contain many of the elements found in home pages of
academic libraries11. Among the characteristics found
are images, screen lengths, colours, number and types
of links, and link headings. The content of these
websites was also analysed and summarised.
Perry, William H reports results of a survey of 675
CD-ROM users, at state University of Newyork at Albany
Libraries, obtaining data from both questionnaires and
actual search strategies12. The Primary aim was to
investigate the effect of prior user training or assistance
on CD-ROM search Strategy. A statistically significant
but weak relationship was found between prior training
and level of search skill. Other measures such as user
status, department affiliation or major, age, sex, and
number of previous CD-ROM uses were compared to
search skill. Only user status and department affiliation
or major were significantly correlated to search skill. The
study concluded that additional research is needed on
the effectiveness of various types of CD-ROM training.
Rehman and Ramzy conducted a study on the
Internet use by health professionals at the health
sciences centre (HSC) of Kuwait University13. The study
showed that 92.1 per cent of the respondents accessed
Internet from their office, while 73.2 per cent also
accessed it from home. Another 28.3 per cent also used
the HSC Library for accessing the Internet. The study
indicated that 80.3 per cent of the respondents used
Internet daily, 15 per cent used it once a week and 2.5
per cent used it once a month. While 88.2 per cent of
the respondents felt that the Internet provided better
access to health sciences information, 77.2 per cent
indicated that through the Internet they had better
professional contacts, and 57.5 per cent stated that with
the use of Internet they were able to use different
channels of communication for their patient care and
research.
Al-Shanbari and Meadows reported that 36 per cent
of the academicians in Saudi universities were spending
four hours per week on reading, whereas, almost threequarters of the respondents were spending the same
amount of time on communicating with their
colleagues14. The study concluded that scholars in
developing countries prefer informal channels for
acquiring the needed information because of inadequate
and irrelevant library collections, lack of information
infrastructures, ineffective library services, lack of money
to use fee-based information services, inadequately
trained and less co-operative library staff.

4. OBJECTIVES
The present study has the following objectives:
(i) To identify the frequency of use of Bar library and
personal library.
(ii) To find out the frequency of area of information need
and frequency of consultation of various legal
documents.
(iii) To identify awareness of the e-resources among
legal professionals of District Courts.
(iv) To find out the frequency of usage of resources by
the lawyers.
(v) To determine the amount of the time spent on eresources.
(vi) To identify the purposes for using the e-resources.
(vii) To suggest suitable recommendations to improve
the e-resources for the benefit of legal professionals.

5. METHODOLOGY
This study attempted to examine the information
needs and information use pattern of District Court
lawyers in Tamil Nadu and also the following areas:
information needs, information sources used by the
respondents, use of Bar library, adequacy of library
collection, library use and computing skills of
respondents, and the use of IT-based library sources
and services.
The researcher selected various categories of
respondents covering Junior and Senior lawyers, Notary
Public, Independent, Government Advocates of District
Courts. Totally 1,000 advocates were selected as
random sampling basis. Respondents who used different
libraries and different e-resources were selected on a
sample. The researcher employed a well structured
questionnaire for collecting the data from the advocates
of Salem, Namakkal, and Erode Districts Courts.
The questionnaire was prepared in such a way that
the respondents could easily understand them. The
respondents were personally requested to fill up the
questionnaire at their earliest convenience to help the
investigator to collect the same during his next visit. The
investigator had to make a second, third and fourth visit
to the bars for collecting the filled-in-questionnaires from
the practicing advocates.
During these visits, the investigator could collect
questionnaires from 720 out of 1000 advocates among
whom the questionnaires were distributed. This
constitutes 72 per cent of the total response. The
researcher carried out the data collection work from
December 2008 to April 2009.

6. LIMITATIONS
The findings of this study are mainly applicable to
practicing lawyers of Salem, Namakkal, and Erode
District Courts and not applicable to other District
Courts in Tamil Nadu. Only Salem, Namakkal, and
Erode District Courts Bar associations were selected for
this study since studying of all other courts was not
possible for an individual researcher, owing to
constraints of money, time, energy, and efforts.

7. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
7.1 Distribution of Respondents by Age and
Sex
It is clear from Table 1 that District Court advocates
(26.8 per cent) of respondents belonged to 31-35 age
group, 21.5 per cent to below 30 age group, 17.9 per
cent to 36-40 age group, 14.0 per cent to 41-45 age
group, 9.2 per cent to 46-50 age group, 3.9 per cent to
51-55 age group and only 2.2 per cent, 1.0 per cent, 0.1
per cent to 61-65, 66-70 and above 70 age group,
respectively. Table 2 describes the distribution of
respondents by sex. As shown in Table 2, 537
(74.6 per cent) of respondents were male and 183 (25.4
per cent) were female. The number of practicing female
lawyers is comparatively much less than male lawyers
in District Courts.

Table 6 contains detailed statistics describing
frequency of information need. While 74.7 per cent of the
district court advocates needed civil law information
frequently, 14.2 per cent occasionally, 7.8 per cent
rarely, and 3.3 per cent moderately. Most of the district
court advocates, i.e., 61.0 per cent needed criminal law
information freqnetly, 25.8 per cent occasionally, 6.8
rarely and 6.4 per cent moderately. In the area of Labour
Law, 25.4 per cent of respondents needed information
frequently, 53.5 per cent occasionally, 13.8 per cent
rarely, and 7.4 per cent moderately. In the area Banking
law they need information 27.6 per cent frequently, 50.4
per cent occasionally, 18.9 per cent rarely and 3.1 per
cent moderately. The above statistics clearly shows that
the district courts advocates most frequently used Civil
and Criminal Law information.

rarely by 2.2 per cent. Supreme Court Cases is
consulted frequently by 72.6 per cent, moderately by 6.4
per cent, occasionally by 11.7 per cent, and rarely by
9.3 per cent. Labour Law Journal is frequently used by
24.9 per cent, moderately by 16.5 per cent, occasionally
by 36.4 per cent, and rarely by 22.2 per cent. Madras
Law Journal is the next important legal documents
which was consulted frequently by 60.7 per cent,
moderately by 8.3 per cent, occasionally by 16.5 per
cent, and rarely by 14.4 per cent. Current Tamil Nadu
Cases as a legal document, were consulted frequently
by 39.7 per cent, moderately by 16.4 per cent,
occasionally by 30.1 per cent, and rarely by 13.8 per
cent. The above statistics clearly shows that the district
court lawyers are mostly depending on the legal
documents like AIR, SCC and MLJ.

7.6 Time Spent at Bar and Personal Library

7.9 Purpose for Using E-resources
The respondents were asked to indicate the main
purpose for using the e-resources. Table 15 shows that
74.9 per cent and 72.6 per cent of the respondents
frequently used the e-resources for accessing the
current decisions of Supreme Court of India and High
Courts of India, respectively, followed by 60.7 per cent
for entertainment, 53.3 per cent for accessing National
Acts, 39.7 per cent for e-journals, and 24.9 per cent for
accessing State Statutes and amendments.

7.10 Extent of Satisfaction on Legal
Information Networks
Information on the web is increasingly becoming
popular day-by-day. Various types of data and
opportunities to explore are made available. Discussion
groups, relay chatting, software packages, biographical
notes, daily news, various High Court judgments,
research communication, institutional publications,
government programmers, and policies are accessible
through web. The fact is that the amount of information/
services hosted on the web is very vast but, consumes
considerable amount of time in browsing and getting
relevant information in a precise form.
Table 16 indicates the gender-wise respondents’
satisfaction on legal information networks. The male
respondents occupy the first position with respect to
their overall satisfaction on all legal information networks
as their secured mean score 4.11 shows on a 5 point
rating scale. The female respondents take the second
position in their overall satisfaction on all legal
information networks as their secured mean score 2.61
shows on a 5 point rating scale. The t test applied for
further discussion shows that he computed t value 6 is
greater than its tabulated value at 5 per cent level of
significance. Hence, there is significant difference
between male and female with respect to their
satisfaction on utilisation of legal information networks.

7.11 CD–ROM Database on Legal Information
Courts in India are moving from the typographical age
to the electronic era. CD-ROM collection is growing in the
High Court libraries. Indexing and abstracting CDs and
directories on CDs are increasing on one hand, and the
legal information CDs on Supreme Court and various High
Courts are growing on the other. Libraries find it economical
when compared to hard copies. These also occupy very
less space. The advocates were asked to indicate the
preference on Legal CD-ROM Database used for their
present study. Different legal CD-ROM Database, viz,
Supreme Court Cases, AIR, Manupatra Case Locator, etc.
were listed in the questionnaire.
Table 17 indicates the gender-wise respondents’
preference for legal CD-ROM databases. The male
respondents occupy the first position with respect to
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

their overall preference on legal CD-ROM databases as
their secured mean score 3.55 shows on a 5 point rating
scale. The female respondents took the second position
in their overall preference on legal CD-ROM databases
as their secured mean score 2.74 shows on a 5 point
rating scale.
The t test applied for further discussion, shows that the
computed t value 2.66 is greater than its tabulated value at
5 per cent level of significance. Hence, there is significant
difference between male and female with respect to their
overall preference for Legal CD-ROM databases. Also,
majority of the respondents 73.75 per cent felt that the eresources cannot replace the print resources, but only
supplement the print resources.
Only 26.25 per cent of the respondents felt that eresources can replace print resources (Table 18).

±

The Bar Association of District Courts should cooperate in providing facilities to procure and giving
access to electronic information resources.

±

Legal professionals should acquire basic skills
including soft skills for acquiring right information
from the right source at the right time in appropriate
format.

±

Whenever necessary, library professionals should
give user education programmes to legal
professionals to help them acquire and practice the
skills.

±

The qualified IT staff should be appointed to provide
the expert guidance to users about e-resources.

±

Bar libraries of District Courts should subscribe
more e-journals and e-databases.

±

Some orientation training programmes should be
organised by the Bar Association at regular intervals
so that the maximum users can improve their
excellence or proficiency in the use of the eresources.

7.12 General Assessment
Respondents were asked to provide their overall
general assessment of the Bar library in meeting their
information needs. Out of the 720 respondents, 447
(62.1 per cent) considered the Bar library ‘good’ in
meeting their information needs. Another 5.1 per cent of
the respondents perceived the Bar library as ‘Excellent’,
13.6 per cent of the respondents assessed the Bar
library as ‘Poor’. Remaining 19.2 per cent of the
respondents said ‘I have no opinion’. Majority of the
respondents were satisfied with the collections, services
and facilities provided by the Bar Association Library for
meeting their information needs (Table 19).

8. SUGGESTIONS
±

The Bar Association should create programmes and
infrastructures to train its advocates on ICT with
particular reference to the use of e-resources.

±

Efforts should be made to increase the speed of the
Internet access and shorten the time it takes to view
and download web pages.

8. CONCLUSION
The study investigated the information needs and
use pattern of District Court Lawyers in Tamil Nadu. It
was found that respondents used a variety of information
sources for legal practicing. Books, law reports and
statues were considered more important. It is interesting
to note that, although respondents perceived the Bar
library as effective in meeting their information needs,
they prefered to first consult their personal library.
Electronic resources have become the vital part of
human life in the present day. It has rapidly changed the
way of seeking and disseminating information. It is clear
from the study that electronic resources are useful to
legal professionals in District Court Bar libraries. The
study revealed that the respondents used IT-based
library sources and facilities less frequently compared
with printed sources. It might be due to the lack of
awareness about their availability, improper selection of
materials or unfamiliarity with these products. Therefore,
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

still there is a vast scope of future research in different
types of users’ behaviour and comparison of users’
behaviour towards the e-resources.
