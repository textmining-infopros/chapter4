ABSTRACT
The information society has brought developments in the way information is created, consolidated, and
accessed. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has produced larger volumes of information, new
ways of packaging information, and new tools for managing information to meet the changing demands of
the user community. In view of the complex information needs of the society and for better accreditation from
National Accreditation and Assessment Council (NAAC), the library and information centre have to play a
greater role in building, developing, and disseminating information products by establishing Virtual Learning
Resource Centre (VLRC). Attempts have been made to notify the significance of this learning resource centre
(LRC) in catering to the technology based information resources and services to support learning, teaching,
and research activities for academics. The study emphasises the role of library managers in developing a
strong ICT infrastructure in rendering Internet and E-communication services for optimisation of e-resources
and tools and developing anticipatory needs of users like compiling web resource directory of interest etc.
The VLRC has to facilitate development of databases, e-learning materials, academic software commons,
indigenous e-resources, and library automation, a basic necessity. The paper concludes that for building 21st
century libraries, librarians and libraries have to focus not only on their abilities but also to adopt the changes
and act as last resort for information access in the VLRC.

1. INTRODUCTION
Education today faces two challenges. One being
the changing quality perception of what learning is.
The other comes from the opportunities that information
technology provides. The first challenge is brought
by the traditional teacher-centred paradigm as ineffective
for student learning, and also educators have proposed
that schooling must refocus on learning as well as
learner’s individual learning needs and needs of instructional
practices. The second challenge is the advancement
of information technology that provides a new context
for teaching and learning. Information and Communication
Technology (ICT), combination of computer hardware
system, software system, and networking infrastructure,
has been a breakthrough for teaching and learning.
It provides an interactive multimedia learning and a
communicating environment for learning. ICT is a
revolutionary innovation across all sectors of society,
providing a wide range of services like e-business,
e-learning, e-health as well as empowerment through

information. Libraries are the preservers and disseminators
of information and hence, the role of libraries is focal
in catering to the timely needs of the users in the
networked environment.
Library and information services in the academic
and research institutes occupy central role in enhancing
the quality of learning, teaching and research activities.
The National Accreditation and Assessment Council
(NAAC) strives for quality and excellence in higher
education and advocates for enhancing the role of
library and information services in improving academic
environment. The assessment of a library, a vital subunit, is a key step that integrates itself with the
overall evaluation. Library is the fulcrum of support
for the entire range of academic activities in an educational
campus. In today’s high-tech learning environment,
the library, as a learning resource, is taking up increasingly
more academic space and time in the life of a learner.
As a matter of fact and to gain better accreditation
from NAAC or All India Council of Technical Education,
65

it is rather inevitable for the library and information
centres in the country to modernise their resources
and services by means of developing VLRCs to encompass
all the quality indicators enunciated by the accreditation
cells, and build better image of librarianship in the
competitive world.

2. WHAT IS LRC?
Learning Resource Centre (LRC) is a term which
is used in the UK to describe a type of library that
exists within an educational setting such as secondary
schools, further education colleges and universities.
The term library has become more of a traditional
terminology owing to technological implications. Availability
of various e-resources and user information consciousness,
the library needs to transform its activities, services,
and outlook for effective information transfer using
technology-mediated access, which is now transformed
into LRC.
The main objective of LRC is to built libraries to
support educational, social, cultural activities of the
academicians, and contribute to the information needs
to support learning, teaching, and research activities
by providing e-resources, indigenous databases, research
productivity, learning course instructional materials,
academic computing software’s in a networked environment
using ICT. In other words, LRC aims to support curriculum
development in academic and research universities,
facilitates changes in teaching practices, encourage
new learning styles and methods and stimulates
development of professional working environment with
organised wealth of information. The mission of the
VLRC is to index thousands of best academic information
websites, selected by teachers and library professionals

worldwide, in order to provide to students and teachers
current valid information for school and university
academic projects. The VLRC is both a dedicated
index of over 10,000 web pages as well as a metasearch engines that include information gleaned from
many of the best research portals and universities
and public libraries. It also includes Internet subject
guides, recommended by teachersand librarians, that
include selected sites in a growing list of subject/
information areas including full-text magazines, newspapers,
electronic text archives, art history, biography, biology,
career information, psychology, history, government
information, literature, medical information, social sciences,
legal information, american civil war, art, careers,
crime, directories, economics, education, English
language, electronic texts, foreign languages, geography,
genealogy, government information, health/medical,
history, legal information, lesson plans, literature,
mathematics, music, reference, science, technology,
tutorials on the Web, and writing style guides
(Fig. 1) 1. With the introduction of VLRC, the teachingcentred programmes would drastically shift to learnercentred paradigms in a networked environment (Table 1).

3. INFORMATION ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES
AT VLRC
In this knowledge arena, one can foresee a role
reversal in the increasingly learner-centric educational
effort wherein the library is becoming the primary
learning resource with conventional classroom teaching
playing mainly a facilitating role. The services of the
libraries have been expanding as they contribute significantly
to the learning process, particularly, the e-learning
process. The best possible information services, as
stipulated by the NAAC, a library in the form of VLRC

Important sites of academic interest.

3.1 Internet and E-communication



A comprehensive directory of websites of various
disciplines have to be compiled and updated as
and when found either through browsing the net
or learnt from discussion forums. Any DBMS/
library software package like SOUL/LibSys can
be used for creating such directories comprising
fields like Title, URL, Description and Subject.
‘Website of the Day’—a column that should be
on the display of the Internet lab.

A strong ICT infrastructure with the state-of-theart technological gadgets comprising computers systems,
high-end-servers including CD/NAS server with a structured
cabling and leased Internet connectivity is a must to
accommodate maximum number of users in the library.
For optimisation of e-resources and tools, following
mechanism is developed.


Add on favourites of Internet/Netscape/Mozilla
browsers under various categories providing link
to web sites, which provides websites on their
desktop without remembering the site address
that is frequently used by them.

3.2 Databases and E-learning Materials
The abstracting databases like LISA/INSPEC/
BIOSIS, etc. can be made available on the CD/NAS
server by creating mirror images of the CD/DVDs
and instructional materials on various subjects accessible
under network within library. Further, efforts be made
to download a wide range of information technology
and personal development-based learning materials
as well as over free e-books and videos and the CDs/
DVDs accompanying books, and kept on the server
with proper indexing. This will be helpful for the academic
and research community in their educational endeavour.
The learning material as shown in screen shot of

websites (Fig. 2) has to be downloaded as an active
service than passive.

projects have to be developed using OSS like GNU
Eprints/DSpace.

3.3 Academic Software Commons

3.5 Library Automation

The important software concerned to each discipline
like SPSS, MatLab, ChemWindow, etc., and e-books,
CD/DVDs and manuals for academic and research
work useful for teaching faculty, research scholars
and students have to be made available in the centre
to serve as a one-stop point for the entire gamut of
knowledge.

In the changing scenario, the library should not
forget the first and foremost duty to automate its
library activities using dedicated library software provisions
for charging and discharging, and facilitating integrated
flow of library activities and services with powerful
OPAC facility to the user community.

3.4 Develop Indigenous E-Databases/EResources
As a knowledge manager and mediator of information
delivery, efforts have to be made by the library scientists
to develop indigenous e-resources like PG syllabus
and question papers of Masters Degree, MPhil, NET/
JRF syllabus of each subject, application forms of
research projects/fellowships/miscellaneous like UGC
major and minor project, Department of Science &
Technology, ICSSR Funding, INSA (Indian National
Science Academy), etc.
All these materials can be given link by creating
dynamic library website or OPAC. Besides, the political,
cultural, economical, social and developmental information
of the region in which university/research university
resides have to be developed so that local information
of all aspects is available in the library for the benefit
of regional society. Also, research productivity of
teaching faculty and research scholars in the form
of books, journal articles/conference papers, research

4. CONCLUSION
Nothing can be accurate, but zeal and urge to
serve the users within the limitations of ICT infrastructure,
general university environment and support from the
management, should be made to improve the usage
of information resources in general and e-resources
in particular. The world of library and information
centres has been witnessing a sea changes due to
development of ICT, which has not only changed the
way information is generated, organised, stored, and
distributed but more importantly have become indispensable
tools for teaching, learning, and research. Therefore,
for building 21st century libraries, the librarians must
focus on their abilities and that of libraries to not just
adapt to change, but to prepare for it, facilitate it and
shape it especially developing a VLRC to encompass
an one-stop information point for academics.
