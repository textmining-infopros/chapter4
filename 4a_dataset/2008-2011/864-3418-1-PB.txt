ABSTRACT
Web resources have exploded in popularity and use and have lead to innovations in learning,
teaching, clinical practice, and patient care. Availability of Web resources has changed what medical
faculty and students actually read and use. However, little research has been done to find out medical
faculty and students’ perception about the Web resources in the medical college libraries. The main aim of
this paper was to investigate the perception of Web as a learning resource by the faculty members and
postgraduate students in medical college libraries of Coastal Karnataka. A questionnaire-based survey of
six medical college libraries in Coastal Karnataka was conducted. The results show that respondents
prefer using the Web more to the traditional library. They perceived that Web contains exhaustive
knowledge and is easy to use.

1. INTRODUCTION
Web is increasingly becoming an important
resource for the today’s learners. Web-based learning
resources like the e-books, online journals, online full-text
databases, bibliographical databases, open access
databases, etc. have gained respectable place in the
higher education system. Today, the Web resources have
become a valuable, perhaps indispensable, for
conducting research, not because of the added
convenience of rapid information retrieval and sharing, but
because it also provides a means of making resources
available that the printed media simply cannot. The
availability and growth of the Web resources offer an
opportunity to find information and data from all over the
world1.
A Web consists of numerous and diversified
information resources around the world. This is the
reason why the net holds the interest of the information
professionals. Almost all the research and academic
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

institutions are connected in one way or the other to the
net. It has become the format of choice for academic
library patrons as they offer users many opportunities
that were not available to their predecessors. The
advantages of Web resources are: international reach,
speed of communication, unlimited capabilities, reduced
cost, convenience, searchability and linking2. A large
number of medical resources for teaching and learning
are available on the Web.
Most large medical centres have publicly accessible
information systems; some organisations such as the
National Institutes of Health have extensive databases and
services that can be used by medical researchers,
clinicians, and educators. Web resources such as
bibliographical databases, full-text online databases,
open access resources/databases and drug information
databases on medical sciences are providing health
information to the medical students and faculty involved
in learning, teaching, patient care, research, and other
developmental activities.

use of it. This study is planned to analyse the faculty and
students’ perceptions on web-based learning resources in
medical college libraries of coastal Karnataka.

1.1 Web

1.4 Medical College Libraries in Coastal
Karnataka

The ‘Web’ refers to a system of computers (servers),
utilising graphical user interfaces and accessed via the
Internet that provides access to documents, multimedia
files and Websites that are connected by hyperlinks to
other documents, multimedia files, and Websites. Web is
increasingly becoming an important resource for the
today’s learners. Web-based learning resources like the
e-books, online journals, online full-text databases and
bibliographic databases, open access databases and
others have gained respectable place in the higher
education system.

1.2 Web Resources
Web resources can mean a multitude of things
including Websites, e-books,
online journals and
databases. Today, Web resources have become a
valuable, perhaps indispensable resource in conducting
research, not because of the added convenience of rapid
information retrieval and sharing, but because it also
provides a means of making resources available that the
printed media simply cannot. The availability and growth
of the Web resources offer an opportunity to find
information and data from all over the world. Internet
resources, in particular Web resources, continue to
proliferate at an astonishing rate. It is possible for almost
anyone to place anything on the Web. Web resources are
defined as those electronic information resources that
users access electronically via a computing network from
inside the library or outside the library.

Coastal Karnataka is a strip between Kasargod and
Karwar and between the Arabian Sea and Western Ghats.
Karnataka’s coast stretches for 300 km along the three
districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara
Kannada. The present study is intended to conduct a
survey on the perception of Web as a learning resource in
medical college libraries of coastal Karnataka. Medical
colleges in coastal Karnataka are managed by private
management/trust/deemed universities and are involved
in
professional
medical
education,
research,
development, and extension programmes. The medical
college libraries are well equipped with modern facilities.
They offer an expanse of knowledge for the faculty and
students to excavate. The computers, Internet facilities
and Web resources allow the faculty and students to
probe beyond the ‘book-world’ and explore wider realms of
knowledge.

1.5 Faculty and Students
In the study, the core user population consists of
faculty members and postgraduate students. The term
‘faculty’ represents the faculty members in medical
colleges in coastal Karnataka, who, in addition to
teaching, are also engaged in research and development
activities. The user population of this study also includes
the postgraduate students who are doing master degree
courses (MD, MS, MCh and DM) in various
specialisations in medical science in medical colleges of
coastal Karnataka.

1.3 Perception
Perception is the act or faculty of receiving
sensations and giving them meaning in the intellect.
Perception may be subjective or objective. Subjective
perception may sometimes be faulty. Since perception is
a component of knowledge, knowledge itself may or may
not be correct, depending upon whether the perception is
correct. Perception refers to a person’s awareness or
appreciation of something. In this study, perception refers
to the feeling of being pleased with Web resources. This
study focuses on the perception of Web resources among
faculty and students in medical college libraries of coastal
Karnataka.
All the medical college libraries in coastal Karnataka
have access to Web resources like online journals, ebooks, and online databases. In medical libraries, faculty
and students’ perceptions of the Web is considered as
an important variable that may influence their use or non
122

2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE
According to Joyce, the advent of the World Wide
Web (WWW) has been the most significant occurrence in
the production and delivery of information in last two
decades. This innovation has not only revolutionalised
information access but also become an important
information resource and a critical tool for pedagogical
purposes especially for both the faculty and the students
in institutions of learning. For instance, the Web today is
a useful tool in supporting the faculty and students in
curriculum instruction and research3.
Joyce further said that Web offers many benefits for
curricular and research development in institutions of
higher learning. The use of the Web can be quite
beneficial to students. For example students benefit from
opportunities to reflect on their research strategies and
think critically about what they are doing. Students are
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

also empowered by gaining control over their own
learning process. They can also be familiarised with the
enormous and tremendous variety of resources and
information available on the Web. The Web particularly
provides students with access to a variety of resources
and current information that is not readily available in
traditional libraries. The continuous use of the Web by
students for learning purposes not only exposes students
to the enormous amount of information available in the
net but also develops their surfing skills3.
Choo, Deltor and Turnbull observed that the range of
Web usage is wide. People use the Web as an
information resource to support their daily work activities
and to engage in a range of complementary modes of
information seeking, varying from undirected viewing that
does not pursue a specific information need, to formal
searching that retrieves focused information for action or
decision making. From the view of students, the Web
affects how, when and where students learn about the
world. It is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. Students can access information anywhere,
anytime, in or out of the classroom. Websites are
continuously updated and revised. Dynamic by its very
nature, the Internet allows students to find, almost daily,
new sources of information on their topics. This nurtures
students’ imagination, creativity and willingness to
explore. Furthermore, students can develop computer
and information literacy skills during the informationseeking experience. Today, our society is computer
driven and information literacy skills build more
productive citizens4.
Wang and Artero found that student’s perceptions
regarding the Web resources plays a central role in
shaping their online behaviours. It is essential to explore
student’s perceptions in order to help improve their online
search and the information evaluation. Intact student
misperceptions might result in the perpetuation of
inefficient online behaviours and the use of the Web
resource5.
Murphy in his study said that students of agriculture
found WWW to be a valuable tool when used in support of
the instructional process. They did not perceived that the
Web was an additional burden in the learning process, nor
did they find it difficult to use. The WWW was an effective
and efficient method to access information on current
events, research materials and communicate with
others6. Lubans7 study indicate that as online information
resources proliferate, college students are making fewer
visits to the campus library to retrieve information and that
their use of the WWW as an information resource is
increasing overall. Lenares8 observed that users perceive
Web resources, in particular electronic journals, hold
many advantages. Faculty members at ARL institutions
cited convenience, timeliness and the ability to search
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)

text as the most important factors in choosing elec-tronic
journals over print. According to Liew, Foo and
Chennupati9 least important to them was animation of
graphics, although others sometimes mention that as an
important advantage. In other surveys, graduate students
said the top reasons for using electronic journals were
the ability to link to additional information, the ability to
search and the currency of materials. Ray and Day10 the
top three ways that access to electron-ic resources has
improved the academic career of students: access to a
wider range of information, faster access to information
and easier access to information. According to Roes11, in
England, Tilburg University fac-ulty members cited timely
availability, easy access, full-text searching and access
from home as factors that promote the use of electronic
journals. Bishop12 observed that focus groups of
engineering faculty members and students wanted to
search electronic journals quickly and easily, but they
desired interfaces that could be customised and the
ability to create personal collections.
According to Browne, Freeman and Williamson13,
college students are increasingly taking advantage of the
Internet and Web to complete course assignments. The
movement away from the library and toward cyberspace
raises important concerns about the nature of information
obtained by students and their ability and desire to
evaluate online information effectively. Accordingly,
groups such as the American Library Association, the
National Institute for Literacy and Myriad Librarians and
instructors have called for schools and universities to
teach Internet literacy skills, with an emphasis on
evaluating the quality of Web-based information.

3. MEDICAL COLLEGES AND THEIR
LIBRARIES IN COASTAL KARNATAKA
Private education is one area in which coastal
Karnataka has made major strides. The human resources
supplied by this area to the country and to the world, are
large, varied and regular. Traditional education in various
forms was present here since long. The modern
educational system was brought in by the Christian
missionaries and the British rulers in the 19th Century and
since then it has grown quite remarkably in quality, size,
and variety. This area is one of the most literate areas in
the country. General education has reached the nook and
corners of the region. Along with the general, professional
colleges like those for allopathic medicine, ayurveda,
engineering, management, nursing, allied health,
industrial training, interior decoration, home science,
social work, etc. have come up. Dakshina Kannada and
Udupi districts in coastal Karnataka are in the forefront in
the medical educational field of the country. There are
seven medical colleges in and around Manipal,
Mangalore and Sullia which attract students from all parts
of the country and abroad (Table 1).

The libraries in medical colleges in coastal
Karnataka witnessed tremendous shifts in collections,
services and access to resources since the mid-2000s.
Computers and computer applications have been widely
introduced which allow the faculty members and
postgraduate students to get medical information for their
teaching, learning, clinical practice, research, etc.

4. OBJECTIVES
The specific objectives of the study were to:
Assess the overall perception of Web resources by
the respondents.

(ii) Understand medical faculty and postgraduate
students’ perception of Web resources.
(iii) Examine the influence of factors—gender, age,
specialities and experience (teaching and learning)
that influence the perception of Web resources.

5. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
Keeping in view the enormity of the task, the author
intends to limit the scope of this study to cover following
six medical colleges of Coastal Karnataka.

Medical college libraries are the special libraries
which have been playing an important role in supporting
the teaching, learning, clinical practices, and research
activities. Rapid accumulation and dissemination of
information is the most important features of the 21st
century. Medical faculty members and postgraduate
students cannot afford to lag behind in this technology.
Therefore, a well equipped library is a must to every
medical college since it is the nerve center of all the
educational and research programmes.

6. METHODOLOGY
The main instrument for data collection was a selfadministered questionnaire. Review of literature, personal
visits, informal interviews, observations and opinion of
experts of library and information science professionals
were also considered.

7. SAMPLING
The total strength of Faculty and postgraduate
students in the surveyed college comprise 2765. A
sample of 696 faculty members and postgraduate
students was selected for the survey. The total sample
size was 25.17 per cent (Table 2). The sample population
was chosen by using the convenience sampling method.

8. COLLECTION OF DATA
The authors chose the ‘directly-administered’
questionnaire method. The data were collected over a 6
months period from October 2008 to March 2009 from all
the six medical college libraries under the study. The
survey instrument was passed out to faculty members
and postgraduate students who visited the library during
this period. Although 696 questionnaires were
administered, only 472 filled in usable questionnaires
(226 faculty members and 246 postgraduate students)
were received making a moderate response rate of 67.82
per cent (Table 2) which was found adequate for the
analysis.

left unexamined, they would continue to maintain their
ineffective online behaviours. Therefore, it is essential to
explore faculty and students’ perceptions in order to help
improve their skills in utilising the Web as a valuable
learning resource. Other important variables correlated
with faculty members and postgraduate students’
perception of Web as a learning resource included their
gender, age groups, specialities, teaching, and learning
experience. The perception analysis of Web resources
was guided by the three research objectives. To achieve
these objectives, subjects were presented with the
following 16 statements that described medical faculty
members and postgraduate students’ perception on Web
as a learning resource:


Web resources are knowledgeable, exhaustive and
authoritarian.



Web resources help to develop my competence.



Web resources are well designed for literature
searching.



Web resources are easy to use and well-focused on
my subject.



Obtaining needed or required information for my
work from Web is very fast and is more time-saving.



I find maximum use of Web resources for study,
teaching, healthcare, and research.



I am able to access all I need using Web resources.



I feel I am being well prepared for my profession
with the help of Web resources.

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)



Knowledge and skills of computer is essential in
accessing Web resources.



Our library provides adequate access to Web
resources.



I am able to access Web resources easily and
comfortably at our library.



I am able to get help from the library staff whenever I
require in accessing Web resources and their
efficiency is relatively satisfactory.



Web resources are more useful than print resources.



Web has more resources compared to the traditional
library.



Information on the Web is more current than that
found in the traditional library.



Web resources also give references, which are not
available in the traditional library.

The above 16 statements used to assess the
perception of Web resources by the respondents on a
five-point scale, where 1=strongly agree, 2=agree,
3=uncertain, 4 = disagree, and 5 = strongly disagree. An
overall score was later computed to indicate the faculty
members and postgraduate students’ overall score at the
16 levels. The maximum score a respondent could attain
at the 16 levels was 5x16=80 while the lowest one could
get was 16 indicating better perception at all. Thereafter
the independent sample T-test (for comparing two
variables) and one-way analysis of variance–ANOVA
(for comparing more than two variables) were used to
125

compare the mean score between groups and to
establish any significant differences in perceptions of
Web as a learning resource with the important
variables—gender, age categories, specialities, teaching
experience of faculty members and learning experience
(year of study) of PGs.

Furthermore, the statement ‘Web resources are
knowledgeable and they are easy to use and wellfocused on my subject’ was strongly agreed or
agreed by majority of postgraduate students
(Table 4).


It was found that vast majority of postgraduate
students and faculty members were of the opinion
that their libraries provide adequate access to Web
resources and further they reported that they could
access Web resources easily and comfortably at
their libraries (Table 4).



This study indicates that there is no significant
difference between faculty members and
postgraduate students in perceiving the Web as a
learning resource as observed by an independent
sample T-test (T=0.738 at P=0.05).

10. MAJOR FINDINGS
On the basis of the results of the survey, the
following significant findings on the perception of Web as
a learning resource were drawn:

10.1 Overall Perception






Majority of respondents perceived that they do enjoy
using the Web as a learning resource and would
indeed wish to use it in the future. Many respondents
also indicated that they do prefer accessing the Web
more than the traditional library. Some of the reasons
that the respondents gave are that the Web has more
resources compared to the traditional library; it is
very fast and time-saving and information on the Web
is more current than that found in the traditional
library. Respondents further stated that Web is more
knowledgeable, exhaustive, authoritarian and easy to
use (Table 3).
Approximate half of the respondents perceived that
they were not able to access all they need using Web
resources. They further perceived that knowledge and
skills of computer are essential for accessing Web
resources.

10.3 Perception of Respondents based on
their Gender


It was noted that there is a minor variation in the level
of perception of usefulness of Web resources for
study, teaching, healthcare and research; and
requirement of knowledge and skills of computer for
accessing Web resources. It was found that levels of
perceptions are slightly high among female
respondents. (Table 5).



Majority of male respondents were not ready to
accept the statement ‘Web resources are more
useful than print resources’ compared to female
respondents. Interestingly, both male and female
respondents almost equally agreed that Web is more
current than the traditional library, it has more
resources compared to the traditional library and
Web resources give references which are not
available in the traditional library. Further, both male
and female respondents were of the common opinion
that Web resources are knowledgeable, they are
easy-to-use and well-focused on their subjects (Table
5).



It can be noted that, almost equal numbers of male
and female respondents were of the opinion that their
libraries have adequate access to Web resources
while high number of female respondents disclosed
that they are able to access Web resources easily
and comfortably at their libraries compared to male
respondents (Table 5).



The results indicated that there is no significant
difference in perceptions of Web between male and
female respondents. This has been evidenced by an
independent sample T-test (T=0.143 at P=0.05).

Interestingly, majority of the respondents were of the
view that their libraries provide adequate access to
Web resources and also agreed that they were able
to access Web resources easily and comfortably at
their libraries (Table 3).

10.2 Perception of Respondents based on their
Positions




126

Majority of the faculty members and postgraduate
students disagreed with the statement ‘Web
resources are more useful than print resources’
(Table 4).
Further, majority of faculty members and
postgraduate students strongly agreed or agreed
that Web is more current than the traditional library
and Web has more resources compared to the
traditional library. The study also pointed out that
majority of the postgraduate students were of the
opinion that Web resources give references which
are not available in the traditional library.

10.4 Perception of Respondents According to
their Age


Majority of the respondents who were in the age
categories of 21-30 years and 31-40 years agreed the
statement ‘Obtaining needed or required information
for my work from Web is very fast and is more timesaving’. Respondents of all age categories agreed
that they are making maximum use of Web for their
study, teaching, healthcare and research; and also
agreed that knowledge and skills of computer is
essential in accessing Web resources. Another
important reveals of this study was that the high
numbers of respondents who were in age categories
of 21-30 years and 41 years and above agreed with
the statement ‘Web resources are more useful than
print resources’ (Table 6).

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2011, 31(2)



The study also confirms that the respondents who
were in age group of 21-30 years strongly agreed or
agreed that Web is more current than the traditional
library compared to other age groups of
respondents. Almost all the age groups of
respondents were of the common opinion that Web
has more resources compared to the traditional

adequate access to web resources compared to
other age groups of respondents. It was also found
that more respondents who were in the age group of
21-30 years expressed their opinion that they could
access web resources easily and comfortably at their
libraries (Table 6).

The result shows that perception on Web resources
is not significantly difference among the various age
categories of respondents. This has been proved
through one-way analysis of variance – ANOVA test
(F=0.077 at P=0.05).

10.5 Perception of Respondents based on
their Specialities


Maximum respondents from clinical speciality
perceived that Web is very fast and more time-saving
compared to the respondents who were from paraclinical and pre-clinical specialities. Result also
shows that majority of respondents from para-clinical
speciality agreed with the statement ‘I find maximum
use of resources for study, teaching, healthcare and
research’. Further, the respondents of all specialities
(clinical, para-clinical and pre-clinical) agreed that
knowledge and skills of computer is essential in
accessing Web resources (Table 7).



Respondents from clinical speciality were of the
opinion that Web is more current than the traditional
library. Further, respondents of all specialities were of
the opinion that Web has more resources compared
to the traditional library and Web resources give
references which are not available in the traditional
library. Furthermore, majority of respondents of all
the specialities remarkably stated that Web
resources are knowledgeable, easy-to-use and wellfocused on their subjects (Table 7).





Majority of respondents of all specialities agreed with
the statement ‘our library provides adequate access
to Web resources’. The study also reported that
majority of respondents from clinical speciality
agreed that they are able to access Web resources
easily and comfortably at their libraries compared to
the respondents of pre-clinical and para-clinical
specialities (Table 7).
All specialities-wise (clinical, para-clinical and preclinical) respondents’ perception on Web resources
indicated that there is no significant difference among
them in perceiving the Web as a learning resource,
which has been evidenced by one-way analysis of
variance–ANOVA test (F=0.786 at P=0.05).



Faculty members with teaching experience of 1-5
years and 11 years and above perceived that Web is
more current than that found in the traditional library.
Further, the faculty members with teaching xperience
of 1 year and above agreed that Web has more
resources compared to the traditional library and
have agreed with the statement ‘Web resources are
knowledgeable and they are easy to use and wellfocused on my subject’. Very less number of faculty
members with teaching experience of 6-10 years
agreed with the statement ‘Web resources give
references which are not available in the traditional
library’ (Table 8).



It can be understood that majority of the faculty
members who were having the teaching experience
of 11 years and above agreed with the statement
‘Our library provides adequate access to Web
resources’. It was noted that majority of faculty
members who were having teaching experience of 610 years were able to access Web resources easily
and comfortably at their libraries (Table 8).



There was no significant difference among the faculty
members who were having the teaching experience of
‘1-5 years’, ‘6-10 years’ and ‘11 years and above’ in
perceiving the Web as a learning resource as
observed by one-way analysis of variance–ANOVA
test (F=0.568 at P=0.05).

10.7 Perception of Postgraduate Students
Based on their Year of Study


Postgraduate students who were studying in 3rd year
overwhelmingly perceived that searching in Web is
very fast and is more time-saving compared to the
postgraduate students who were studying in 1st year
and 2nd year. Almost all the postgraduate students
who were studying in 1st year, 2nd year and 3rd year
equally agreed that they are making maximum use of
Web for their study, teaching, healthcare and
research, knowledge and skills of computers are
essential in accessing Web resources, and
information in the Web is more current than that
found in the traditional library. Almost half of the
postgraduate students who were in 1st year, 2nd year
and 3rd year disagreed with the statement ‘Web
resources are more useful than print resources’
(Table 9).



The study reveals that less number of postgraduate
students who were studying in 1st year felt that Web
resources are easy-to-use and well-focused on their
subject compared to other postgraduate students
who were in 2nd year and 3rd year. Majority of

10.6 Perception of Faculty Members According
to their Teaching Experience


132

Faculty members with teaching experience of 1 year
and above perceived that searching in Web is very
fast and is more time-saving and they are making
maximum use of Web for their study, teaching,
healthcare and research activities. Further, they
agreed that knowledge and skills of computers is
essential in accessing the Web resources. Majority
of the faculty members with teaching experience of
11 years and above disagreed with the statement
‘Web resources are more useful than print resources’
(Table 8).

postgraduate students who were studying in 3rd year
confirmed that Web has more resources compared to
the traditional library. Vast percentages of
postgraduate students who were studying in 1st year,
2nd year and 3rd year agreed that Web resources give
references which are not available in the traditional
library and further they also agreed that Web
resources are knowledgeable, easy-to-use and wellfocused on their subjects (Table 9).




One of the important reveals of the study is that an
overwhelming number of postgraduate students who
were in 1st year, 2nd year and 3rd year felt that the
Web services provided by their library were
adequate. The study also revealed that postgraduate
students who were studying in 2nd year have
indicated that they are able to access Web
resources easily and comfortably at their libraries.
Result indicated that there is no significant difference
among postgraduate students who were studying in
1st year, 2nd year and 3rd year in perceiving the Web as
a learning resource. This has been proved by one-way
analysis of variance–ANOVA test .

11. CONCLUSION
After the investigation of perception of Web
resources, it was observed that medical faculty members
and postgraduate students in medical college libraries of
coastal Karnataka prefer using the Web more to the
traditional library. They perceived that Web is more
knowledgeable, exhaustive, authoritarian and easy to
use. Web resources are becoming popular now. This
study understands the need to make a deliberate effort to
encourage medical faculty members and postgraduate
students to make use of Web resources as part of their
teaching, learning, clinical practice and other
assignments/seminars/publications, etc. as Web
resources such as online databases, online journals, ebooks and open access resources provide a truly
staggering amount of useful and up-to-date medical
information.
