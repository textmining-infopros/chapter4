ABSTRACT
The paper provides a brief introduction to the establishment of the National Institute of Library and
Information Sciences (NILIS) of Sri Lanka, its main functions and education and training programmes
currently offered. It also discusses the changing pedagogical paradigms within the Sri Lankan education
system and relevance of information literacy (IL). The paper also describes an international workshop
organised by NILIS under the auspices of IFLA/ALP in 2004 which gave birth to Empowering 8TM a new
IL model. The author discusses the necessity of developing such a model within the South Asian region,
and also discusses a case study which integrates information skills into the Postgraduate Diploma in
Teacher Librarianship conducted by NILIS.
Keywords: Information skills, information literacy models, empowering 8TM.

1. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF LIBRARY &
INFORMATION SCIENCES
1.1 Background
In 1996, Ministry of Education of Sri Lanka
started the Second Phase of the General Education
Project (GEP2) with the World Bank assistance,
which implemented many education policy reforms.
Under this project, 4000 school libraries were developed
to promote resource-based teaching and learning
in the Sri Lankan education system. Since there
was a severe shortage of trained school library
professionals, it was decided to train 4000 teachers
as teacher librarians at the beginning and the project
was searching for an organisation to undertake this
responsibility. During this period a proposal to establish
an institute of Library & Information Science was
submitted to the World Bank by the Sri Lankan
University Grants Commission.
The World Bank agreed to fund the establishment
of this institute on the condition that it trains these
18

teacher librarians. Accordingly, the National Institute
of Library and Information Sciences (NILIS) was
established in 1999 affiliated to University of Colombo,
Sri Lanka.

1.2 Functions
The institute has been given authority by the
Ordinance to perform the following significant functions:
±

To admit students

±

To provide instruction, training and research in
various branches of LIS

±

To determine the postgraduate degrees, diplomas,
certificates and other academic distinctions to
be awarded in LIS

±

To conduct examinations and award postgraduate
degrees, diplomas, certificates and other academic
distinctions in LIS

±

To cooperate by way of exchange of teachers,

students and scholars with universities or institutions
in Sri Lanka or abroad, having similar objectives
to those of NILIS
±

To institute and award fellowships, scholarships,
exhibitions, bursaries, medals and other prizes.

1.3 Education and Training Programmes
NILIS started its first education programme in
October 2002 and currently runs two types of programmes.
Short-term programmes (workshops, seminars, lectures
and certificate courses) for which certificates of
participation are awarded by NILIS, and Diplomas
and Postgraduate programmes for which the University
of Colombo awards the certificate. Following courses
are conducted regularly:
±

Certificate in School Librarianship—A six months
course for school library staff who have had no
training in librarianship before

±

Certificate in Teacher Librarianship—A six months
course for school teachers who have had no
training in librarianship before

±

ICT for school/teacher librarians—A four months
course for school/teacher librarians

±

Certificate in Public Librarianship—A six months
course for public library staff

±

Diploma in Teacher Librarianship—A 300 hr
diploma course for trained teachers

±

Diploma in Library and Information Management—
A three-year part time course for young school
leavers

±

Postgraduate Diploma in Teacher Librarianship—
A two-year part time course for teachers with
a Bachelors degree from a recognised higher
education institute

±

Postgraduate Diploma in LIS—A two-year part
time course for those with a Bachelors degree
from a recognised university. This is an entry
point for the new entrants to the profession

±

Masters in Teacher Librarianship—A two-year
part time course for teachers with a Bachelors
degree and a PG Diploma in Education or any
other discipline from a recognised higher education
institute

±

Most of these courses are offered in Sinhala
as well as in English depending on the student
demands.

2. NECESSITY OF TRAINING IN IL FOR
NILIS
2.1 Changing Pedagogical Paradigms
The World Bank project in Sri Lanka has supported
the infrastructure development of 4000 school libraries
(about 50 per cent of the schools in the country).
This initiative was taken to support the resourcesbased student centred learning emphasised in the
new education policy reforms of Sri Lanka. Even if
the physical structures are developed, human resources
are not yet adequately developed in all these libraries
and still the library is perceived by many as a
storehouse of books. While the general education
policy reforms are being implemented at school
level, University Policy Reforms were also introduced
in 1996 and a Presidential Task Force was appointed
to make recommendations for the implementation
of the policy reforms. Following these recommendations
made by the Presidential Task Force on University
Reforms, the University Grants Commission of Sri
Lanka promoted a series of reforms in the university
system covering curriculum reform, staff development,
career guidance services, quality assurance and
accreditation and formulation of corporate plans
and a new universities Act. A strong emphasis was
laid on improving the quality and relevance of university
education because many surveys have concluded
that the quality of university education has to be
improved and made relevant to the world of work.
It is the responsibility of NILIS to promote resourcebased student centred learning and to promote
competencies in learning to learn among its student.
Accordingly NILIS incorporated information literacy
in all its teacher librarianship programmes.

2.2 Information Literacy
IL is defined as an individual’s ability to recognise
need for information, identify and locate appropriate
information sources, know how to gain access to
the information contained in those sources, evaluate
the quality of information obtained, organise the
information, and use the information effectively. 1
An information literate person is one who:
±

Recognises that accurate and complete information
is the basis for intelligent decision making

±

Recognises the need for information

±

Formulates questions based on information needs
19

±

Identifies potential sources of information

±

Develops successful search strategies

±

Accesses sources of information including computerbased and other technologies

±

Evaluates information

±

Organises information for practical application

±

Integrates new information into an existing body
of knowledge

±

Uses information in critical thinking and problem
solving.1

In an information literate environment, students
engage in active, self-directed learning activities,
and teachers facilitate students’ engagement through
a more adventurous style of instructional delivery.
Initially there was a lack of competent lecturers to
teach this subject but under GEP2 support was
extended to NILIS by Dr Penny Moore of New Zealand,
who is an authority on IL. Dr Moore was invited in
2003 to conduct a two-week workshop at NILIS.
With this initial training NILIS started training teacher
librarians in IL. However, it was felt that Sri Lanka
needs more exposure to IL. A proposal was submitted
to IFLA/ALP in early 2004 to seek funds to conduct
a one-week workshop on Information Skills for Learning.
NILIS is the national body responsible for library
and information education in Sri Lanka and also the
national institute responsible for the education and
training of teacher librarians for the 4000 school
libraries developed under the World Bank project
(and also for other school libraries). Therefore, it
was felt that it is the best institution to undertake
this kind of a workshop and initiate the changing
process of ‘school libraries’ into ‘School Learning
Resource Centers’. In keeping with the IFLA/ALP
objectives the workshop was meant to be regional.
The proposal was accepted by IFLA/ALP and funding
was provided to conduct the workshop. In addition
to about 40 Sri Lankans there were 11 delegates
from 10 South and Southeast Asian countries. Workshop
was facilitated by expert resource persons from
Australia, Canada, Malaysia and UK.
Its main objectives were to:
±

Re-orient classroom situations from ‘chalk and
talk’ to project-directed learning away from
classrooms and into learning information centres

±

To re-position the ‘library’ as the central core
providing students learning experiences and for
teachers as the central resource to guide the
learners

20

±

To re-orient school libraries from libraries to
Learning Resource Centres in order to improve
the quality of school education

±

To re-focus school librarianship skills away from
materials-based collections management to active
information provision exploiting IT

±

To make known IFLA/UNESCO School Library
Manifesto and IFLA /UNESCO School Library
Guidelines

±

To define information literacy skills, i.e., what
is IL? What does IL look like? What makes it
work? What skills do children require to become
information literate?

±

To develop strategies in educational institutions
for incorporating IL skills teaching as an integral
part of curricula

±

To develop a realistic model to introduce information
skills at national level.

When a plethora of IL models are already available,
one may question why the wheel was being reinvented. Re-inventing the wheel or developing another
model was essential because of the composite
culture and local conditions in these countries. If
an existing model used in a developed country is
imposed, it would have been difficult for the stakeholders
to understand the philosophical roots behind the
model. Therefore, the workshop participants, throughout
five days worked from identifying the need of information
literacy through comparison of different models to
building a new model to suit the local needs of the
region. A detailed account of this workshop and the
development of the model can be found in Wijetunge
and Alahakoon 2005 2.

2.3 Empowering 8TM IL Model
Empowering 8 TM is the IL model developed at
this international workshop. It is now registered as
an intellectual property of NILIS and being promoted
in LIS programmes offered by NILIS and in a variety
of other educational contexts of Sri Lanka. Though
it is registered as a property of NILIS it does not
restrict anyone from using Empowering 8 TM for non
profit making educational purposes. NILIS, however
expects that such users will share the applications
to enrich its knowledge. Empowering 8 TM can be
defined as a model which can be used to solve any
information problem effectively using eight stages
with several sub-stages under each component. It’s
not necessary to complete these stages in a linear
order, but one can enter the cycle from any point

and proceed in a cyclical manner. However, one is
taken through all stages in a successful information
problem solving situation. Two arrowed lines denote
the teacher and the teacher librarian getting involved
in the process (Fig.1). Empowering 8 TM has a set
of 108 corresponding skills ranging from defining
the need for information to application of new concepts
learned to other situation. This list of skills is still
being reviewed depending upon the experience gained.
Developing competencies in these skills will take
place according to the nature and complexity of the
problem being solved using Empowering 8 TM .
Empowering 8 TM process and the skills are
applicable to all subject areas across the full range
of levels from kindergarten to postgraduate. It is not
limited only to the educational context but can be
applied in a variety of problem solving situations in
the personal and work environments as well. Empowering
8TM is best understood and practiced when integrated
with the curriculum activities therefore the training
programme, which is described in this paper, integrates
the eight components of Empowering 8TM and related
skills with an assignment topic relevant to the postgraduate
programme.

3. DEVELOPING INFORMATION SKILLS:
THE CASE STUDY
One of the postgraduate courses conducted by
NILIS was chosen to introduce the information skills
development programme as a pilot project, the details
of which are given below:

DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2008, 28(2)

3.1 Postgraduate Diploma in Teacher
Librarianship
Postgraduate Diploma in Teacher Librarianship
(PGTL) is designed for teacher librarians who have
been recruited with only a Bachelor’s degree in any
discipline so that once completed, those with exposures
to different academic disciplines at undergraduate
level will receive a common knowledge of teacher
librarianship.
The objectives of the programme are:
±

To give professional education and training in
basic professional skills, which will enable students
to confidently enter into work assigned to newly
qualified teacher librarians

±

To provide a broad understanding of the principles
of teacher librarianship, the organisation and
management of school libraries and information
centres, and ways of handling, storing, and
retrieving information in all media, and

±

To introduce students to the theory and practice
of research as it is applied in the field of teacher
librarianship at the postgraduate level.

All PGTL students study a core of seven subjects
which cover a total of 360 classroom contact hours.
In addition to the core subjects, they have to complete
a work attachment equal to 40 hours in a recognised
library and to prepare a project report not less than
6000 words based on an independent study. The

21

subject structure is indicated below:

Project report.

PGTL commenced in 2003 and there were two
full-time intakes in 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 academic
years. These students were school teachers with
several years of experience and in service training
in teaching and learning. Few of them were Bachelor
of Education Degree holders. But the current intake
is different from the previous intakes. In the later
part of 2005 Ministry of Education, recruited a little
more than 2000 newly qualified graduates as teacher
librarians with the objective of filling the existing
teacher librarian vacancies in the government schools.
Although priority was given to library science graduates
and graduates with a library science component in
their degree, there were not many applicants with
these qualifications. Therefore, graduates in other
disciplines who were willing to join as teacher librarians
were also recruited. Twenty two such new graduates
comprises the current PGTL group. Since they are
just recruited they are not entitled for full-time study
leave, hence PGTL had to be conducted in parttime mode in 2005-2007. The group of students is
heterogeneous in their academic backgrounds. They
represent many established older universities as
well as recently established regional universities.
Some of them have studied as internal students in
formal university environments while others have
been external students who studied independently
away from traditional university set-up. Subjects
they have studied for Bachelor,s vary from Library
Science, Sinhala, and Philosophy, Economics, Business
Management, and Mass Communication. Due to
the variations in their prior learning environments,
it was felt that they need an orientation programme
to familiarise themselves to the academic environment
of NILIS, especially those who have studied as
external students needed guidance in using the
22

library resources and computers, academic style
of writing and in many other academic aspects. It
was also felt that without such an orientation programme
it will be difficult for the students to perform well
in their formal internal academic environment at
NILIS which is highly student centered.

3.2 Implementation
The orientation programme is based on an
assignment topic chosen by the module lecturer.
Using the eight components of the Empowering 8 TM
model, learners are taken through the process of
defining the topic to creating and assessing the
results. To guide the students a variety of check
lists, activity sheets and guidelines are provided.
Duration of the module is forty classroom contact
hours spread across nine days with a similar number
of self-study hours. Following section will explain
how the students were taken through each component
of the model. Expected learning outcomes, rationale
and the specific learning activities planned for each
component are described. Though many activity
sheets are used during the process only two most
significant ones are indicated here due to space
limitations.The time frame allocated to each component
is indicated in Table 1.

Rationale
It is strongly believed that any information skills
programme has to be integrated into the actual
learning environment to be effective. Course coordinator identified a general topic suitable for the
first module of PGTL before the commencement of
the actual orientation programme and the students
are expected to refine it by following the recommended
activities. The topic chosen in this instance is “the
role of the teacher librarian within the school community”.
As newly recruited teacher librarians the students
need to learn this topic. It was decided that rather

than lecturing on the role of the teacher librarian,
we will allow students to engage actively in finding
the answer. Since it is the very first assignment of
the course it was the ideal topic to integrate and
introduce information skills. Because the finished
product will be assessed for the final marks, students
do have necessary motivation to complete the module
successfully.

Rationale
Many students did not have previous experience
in using a library effectively. Therefore at this stage,
effective use of a library for their learning activities
is introduced. Initially students were introduced to
the NILIS library and thereafter they were taken on
a study tour to the National Library which they will
have to use frequently during their period of study.
Activities

3.3.3 Empowering 8 : Select
Learning Outcome
±

Choose relevant information to suit the purpose

±

Determine which sources are too easy, too
hard, or just right.

Rationale

At this stage students were introduced to different
types of information resources available in the library,
identification of key sections of the information
sources, and evaluation of information sources.

Many students have a problem of organising
their notes in a logical manner, therefore, they
sometimes tend to load the assignment with a
mass of irrelevant information. They also have little
or no previous experience in note taking and using
visual organisers or preparing a list of references
or a bibliography. Organise stage will expose them
to these aspects.

Activities

Activities

±

Students in groups identified parts of a book
and a journal using the fact sheet given

±

Lecture on the use of the recommended sources
to practice note taking skills

±

Students located different types of information
sources (books, journals, reports, videos, CD/
ROMs, etc.) which contain information relevant
to their assignment from the library using an
activity sheet

±

Using the newly acquired knowledge and learn
to take notes for the assignment on their own

±

Prepare a list of references for the assignment
topic according to the Harvard system. It requires
that they include different formats of information
sources including electronic formats.

Rationale

±

Introduction to using a printed general encyclopedia

Rationale

Rationale

Many students are too nervous to make presentation
in the class but this is an essential requirement of
teacher librarians. Students were exposed to making
presentations and giving/receiving feedback.

This stage commenced with the evaluation of
the assignment by the lecturer. Depending on the
marks and experience gained, students were guided
to engage in reflective thinking for future applications.

Activities

Activities

±

presentation by peers

3.4 Assessment

±

Review and adopt a commonly agreed upon
evaluation form for individual presentations

±

Make a five minute oral presentation on the
chosen topic

±

Each student to provide feedback for at least
five other students using the evaluation sheets.

3.5.7 Empowering 8TM: Assess
Learning Outcome
±

Accept feedback from other students and the
lecturer

±

Consider what could be done better next time.

Preparing reflective notes for future use and
add the presentation to an individual portfolio.

Since the aim of the module is to provide the
students with a sound training in using information
sources (both traditional and contemporary) so that
they become information literate, evaluation of the
assignment placed more weight on the process
followed rather than the subject contents.
Lecturer advised the students at the beginning
to maintain a folder to keep different activity sheets,
mind maps, notes and other documentation for final
evaluation. Elements of assessment used in the
project are given in the Appendix 3.

4. CONCLUSION

Students were given two-three week to write
and submit their assignment incorporating and improving
their draft work based upon the feedback.

We realised that the performance of the PGTL
group subjected to this project is far better than the
two previous cohorts. Students’ feedback indicated
that they appreciated the orientation programme
very much since it introduced them to a wide variety
of new skills which will support them in becoming
independent lifelong learners. We have decided that
we will extend this programme to all our postgraduate
programmes from 2006.
