ABSTRACT
The paper presents an overview of LIS education in South India. It describes the state-of-the-art of LIS
education in 27 LIS Departments of South India, analyses the course content and suggests for innovativeness
and standards to meet the present and future demands of knowledge society.
Keywords: LIS education, South India

1. INTRODUCTION
The aim of professional education is to prepare the
members of that profession for its successful practice
by giving a good foundation in its theory and practice.
The strength of the profession lies in the quality of
manpower available to practice the profession. The goal
of LIS education is, therefore, to prepare personnel for
the task of successful performance at different levels of
competence as managers in different types of libraries
and as teachers in the schools of LIS.
It is argued that the progress of information
processing and information technology move together in
present day information society. Examples are given
that there is a significant professional relevance of
information technology for LIS and for the quality of
information delivery as well like Web 2.0; semantic web;
ontologies, etc. To adequately pursue the goal of
transmission of information through innovative use of
information technology for the 21st century, information
professionals are needed who are proficient in library
science and information technologies. The promotion of
practical skills and professionalism is posited as
fostering the development of competent information
practitioners.
Therefore, raising the scope and the quality of LIS
education is inevitable to raise the quality and efficiency
of knowledge dissemination/transmission. The updating
of curricula and courses to develop the technical
competencies is being done from time to time with the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

support of University Grants Commission (UGC) subject
panels and Reports of Curriculum Development
Committees (CDCs). The paper analyses existing
programmes of the LIS departments in South India to
meet the growing demand for competent manpower. It
further suggests how the LIS departments have to
respond to produce the expected kind of professionals.

2. LIBRARY SCIENCE EDUCATION IN SOUTH
INDIA—A BRIEF REVIEW
LIS education in India began in 1911, when the
Baroda School was started by W.A. Bordon at the
initiation of the Sayaji Rao Gaikwad II, the then
Maharaja of the State of Baroda. Over the past 99 years
LIS education in India has undergone significant
changes with the support of UGC, The seeds of LIS
education in South India were sown 90 years ago in AP,
which was then under the composite Madras State. The
first training course was initiated in 1920 under
auspices of Andhra Desh Library Association.
The Madras Library Association started certificate
programme in librarianship in 1931; it was later taken
over by Madras University under the able and dedicated
service of Prof. S.R. Ranganathan. Andhra University,
Visakhapatnam, introduced library science course in
1935 with the initiation of the then university librarian
M.O. Thomas. However, major developments in LIS
education in South India have occurred after
independence. Another landmark in the history of library
19

science education in South India is the starting of
distance education programmes. The Madras University
introduced
library
science
education
through
correspondence in 1982 followed by the establishment
of A.P. Open University (now renamed as Dr.B.R.
Ambedkar Open University) that initiated BLIS in 1985.

3. LIS EDUCATION IN SOUTH INDIA: THE
PRESENT SCENARIO
Library
science
education
blossomed
in
independent India and the 1960s and 1970s witnessed
its rapid growth at graduate and postgraduate level. This
is the period for the development of research courses
leading to PhD and MPhil degrees. At present 25
universities in South India offer the course as regular,
on campus and through distance mode. Two colleges,
Bishop Heber and A.V.M. Pushpam, have full-fledged
departments and are functioning under Bharathi Dasan
University.
The revolutionary change in 1990s was the starting
of two-years integrated MLIS programmes instead of
1+1 stream of BLIS and MLIS. At this juncture, some
Universities have placed their LIS departments under
Science Faculties (Madras, Kuvempu, etc.) These
departments renamed their course as MSc in Library
and Information Science. This has facilitated the
departments to get more grants under UGC/SAP.
However, majority of departments are classed under
Social Sciences.

4. THE METHODOLOGY
The study includes 26 universities that offer LIS
courses at graduate or postgraduate levels, and MS
(LIS) course of Documentation Research and Training
Centre (DRTC), Bangaluru. The universities include
150-year old (Madras) to recently started state
universities like B.R.A. University, Srikakulam, (Andhra
Pradesh); Dravidian University, Kuppam, (Andhra
Pradesh); Karnatak State Women’s University, Bijapur;
and Tumkur University. Nagarjuna University and
University of Hyderabad do not have a department but
the former offers Distance Education Council (DEC)
recognised BLIS course while the later offers
Postgraduate Diploma in Library Automation and
Networking through distance mode.
University of Hyderabad was therefore not analysed.
There are other universities and institutions that offer the
course but the study is confined to the courses
recognised by UGC or DEC. Data was gathered through
a questionnaire from 26 departments. Data from DRTC
was taken from its Website. The response rate was 100
per cent with the support of Heads of the Departments of
concerned universities. The tables present a
20

comparative account while the salient features are
analysed and discussed.

5. ANALYSIS OF DATA
The data gathered through questionnaire from 26
University departments of South India and DRTC that
offer LIS courses has been tabulated, analysed and
discussed.

5.1 Nomenclature
The departments are named as Department of
Library and Information Science and the degrees are
named as Bachelor or Masters in Library and
Information Science (BLIS/MLIS). Madras University
and Kuvempu University named their degree as MSc
(Library and Information Science). DRTC offers its
two-years course as MS (LIS).

5.2 LIS Courses in South India
In South India the courses are being offered in two
patterns—BLIS and MLIS of one-year each generally
referred to as 1+1 pattern, and two-year integrated MLIS
programme. Table 1 shows that majority (23/26) of the
departments offer two-year integrated course while rest
follow 1+1 pattern. Further, BLIS is being offered in
distance mode in 10 and MLIS in 5 universities. Four
universities offer the course through regular and
distance mode while two (BRAOU, Nagarjuna) offers the
same only through distance mode. Three universities
(Annamali, KSWU, Kakathiya) have certificate courses
also though it is against the stipulation of the UGC.
Annamalai also offers a five-year integrated course
besides the other. Three universities (Annamalai,
University of Hyderabad, and Pondicherry) offer P.G.
Diploma in Library Automation and Networking in
evening or distance mode.
The LIS courses in South India are varied and
provide a wide opportunity. However, there is no
uniformity in the courses as the departments are
offering courses from certificate to research level and
follow different patterns or combination of patterns as
displayed in Table 1. Though the UGC stipulates to offer
a course on-campus or off-campus with an established
department and Board of Studies in the concern subject
to frame and revise the curriculum there are universities
that do not follow the stipulation. The findings indicate
the need to devise regulations to streamline the courses
offered as regular and distance mode.

Note: *:Newly established state universities; +: Certificate Course; #: PGDLAN; R: Regular; D: Distance mode; F.T: Full-time;
P.T: Part-time; Gen: General; SF: Self-finance
etc. Degree in any subject is the basic criteria for
admission into BLIS or integrated MLIS. BLIS is the
criteria for admission into MLIS one-year course. The
two-years integrated MLIS course seems to maintain
standard at the entry level as 14 out of 26 departments
under study conduct entrance examination to select the
candidates. This pattern is not followed in 1+1 stream
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

by any university except Kakatiya, which conducts
entrance test for MLIS (1 year). The eligibity criteria for
MS (LIS) of DRTC is exemplary as the basic
qualification required is graduation with 60 percentile
and a national level entrance test. Such criteria
facilitate best intake. Another revelation of the data is
with regard to admissions. Though the number of seats
21

for a regular course is limited and ranges from 20 to 60,
the intake for distance education is unlimited in case of
BLIS. It is a matter of concern as the professional
course ought to supply the manpower in accordance
with the demand and not to produce unemployed or lowsalaried professionals as it will have negative image on
the profession. The regular programmes are following
Semester System as per UGC/NAAC stipulation while
the distance mode follows year-end pattern.
Majority of the universities are offering the course
under self-finance scheme. The fee under self-finance
is considerably high and ranges from Rs 10,000 to
approximately Rs 35,000. This is possible because
there is a demand for the course. In contrast, DRTC
offers its course without any fee and infact pays a
stipend to the students. It can be generalised that the
LIS courses in south India are in demand as the
courses are offered through self-finance and distance
mode with considerably high fee structure.

5.4 Curriculum
There are little variations in the nomenclature of the
papers though the contents are more or less same. The
departments devised their syllabi suitable to ChoiceBased Scheme Courses (CBSC). The subject content
of syllabi are analysed below:
BLIS course content includes: Foundations of
Library and Society; Library Classification (theory);
Library Catalogue (theory); Library Management;
Information
Sources
and
Services;
Library
Classification (practical); Library Catalogue (practical);
and Computer Applications in LICs.
MLIS
one-year
course
content
includes:
Information, Communication and Society, Management
of LICs; Information Processing and Retrieval;
Information and Communication Technology (theory
and practical) Information Systems and programmes;
Research methods and statistical analysis in LIS; and
Elective-traditional library system like academic/public/
special library systems.
MLIS two-years integrated course has variations in
its nomenclature of papers. However, the course
content is based on the UGC Model Curriculum (2001)1,
hence for the sake of study of MLIS two-year syllabus
offered by 21 departments, the nomenclature of “Model
Curriculum” was taken as standard course title. The
core papers include: Foundations of Library Science;
Knowledge Organisation, Information Processing and
Retrieval (theory); Knowledge Organisation, Information
Processing and Retrieval (practice); Information
Technology: Basics Part 1 (theory), Part 2 (practice);
Management of Library and Information Centres;
22

Information Sources and Services (theory); Information
Sources and Services (practice); Library and Users
Part 1 (theory), Part 2 (practice); Information and
Communication; Information Analysis, Repackaging and
Consolidation; Information Retrieval Part 1(theory), Part
2 (practice); Research Methods and Statistical
Techniques; Information Technology: Applications; and
Information Technology: Applications (practice).
The electives/optional include traditional academic,
public, special library systems, and innovative courses.
For example the DRTC and the universities of Madras,
Andhra, Karnataka, etc., enriched their syllabi with
more ICT courses like digital libraries; digital library and
multimedia; web technology; webpage design;
e-publishing; expert systems; knowledge management;
database technology and networking; telecommunication and data transmission; content management
systems; network technologies; semantic web. The
courses include both theory and practicum. For
example, syllabi of Departments of Andhra, Mysore and
Karnataka Universities include Digital libraries (theory)
and Digital Libraries (practicum) as two separate papers.
It is obvious from the analysis that the curricula of
MS (LIS) programme of DRTC, Bengaluru, is outstanding
with balanced emphasis on all aspects and emphatic on
practicum and student-centred learning. Of course the
advantage lies in the admission criteria. In the traditional
university departments efforts are being made to impart
core as well as advanced content by striking a balance
between traditional and ICT-based course content.
However, the extent of practical training in library
automation software and the hours of hands-on practice
made by the student are doubtful as commercial
packages like LIBSYS, etc. are not available in the
departments and packages like CDSISIS/WINISIS are
not integrated LIS software. Only option is to train in
KOHA or NewGen Lib software packages for which
trained teachers are required. A salient feature of
Pondicherry University LIS curriculum is practical
training in library automation software like KOHA,
WINSIS, LIBSYS, SOUL, GSDL, Dspace, and E-prints.
The coordination between libraries and the
departments will give the students more exposure and
practice in integrated library management software in
real-information environment. However, one striking
lacunae is that the syllabi do not take care of soft skills,
essential for the present day LIS professional, to grab a
good employment or to get through UGC-NET
examination. There are thoughtful departments that have
included it as part of the curriculum. For example,
University of Mysore offers a core course on Personality
Development and Communication Skills; University of
Madras offers a core course on soft skills in all four
semesters that are being conducted at the campus
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

level; Pondicherry University offers a core course on
Communication Skills and Public Relations. DRTC
syllabus has seminar/colloquia of 4 credits each. The
other departments are trying to develop soft skills by
adopting teaching/learning techniques like seminar,
group discussion, etc., but it is advisable to have soft
skills as a core paper in the curriculum to meet the
demands of the contemporary information environment.
The course contents are drawn with ample attention
to the core as well as elective courses with focus on
ICTs except few exceptions and variations. Therefore,
the curricula are strong enough to pass on the
professional knowledge to the students with regard to its
content.

5.5 Teaching Tools
Instructions help students in better understanding of
the subject, its structure, analysing current practices in
information handling, active learning, and critical
thinking skills. To deliver these critical informationseeking skills effectively, teachers have to adopt the
active learning methods. Departments are adopting, in
addition to the traditional chalk and talk method, new
methods of teaching like audio-visual teaching
techniques using OHP or LCD, to achieve necessary
impact on the learner’s comprehension of the subject.
Nineteen departments have LCD projector which is an
encouraging factor, but e-learning packages and online
teaching is a rare feature. Seminars and group
discussion are the other teaching methods in vogue.
The distance education programmes of most of the
universities are confined to reading material and
counseling except BRAO University that developed elearning packages and tele/video conferencing
sessions. It can be concluded that use of teaching tools
is not uniform and brings variations in the teaching/
learning
practices,
especially
the
learner’s
comprehension. Developing e-learning packages for LIS
courses is a viable alternate that provide an opportunity
to receive expert lectures and facilitate self-learning.

5.6 Research in Library Science in South India
Library Science research in India was started in
1948 at Delhi University under the guidance of Prof.
S.R. Ranganathan. The establishment of DRTC at
Bangaluru in 1962 gave boost to research activity in
library science. Later the library science departments of
various other universities also initiated research
programmes leading to PhD. During 1990s MPhil
courses were also introduced. The library science
departments of the South Indian universities are in
forefront in offering the PhD and MPhil as regular fulltime and part-time programmes. There were universities
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

that offered research courses through distance mode
also. However, these courses have been dispensed with
as per UGC’s order to stop research through distance
mode to maintain high standards of research. The
research programmes of Dr B.R. Ambedkar Open
University are however an exception.
It is evident from the Table 1 that 19 universities in
south India conducts research courses at PhD and 12 at
MPhil levels as full-time programmes, besides DRTC.
Dravidian University is set to commence the programme
from 2010. The UGC guidelines for research admissions
(Appendix 2) is followed in all regular research with MLIS
with 55 per cent as the basic eligibility with preference
to
JRF/NET/SLET
candidates.
However,
few
departments have set the eligibility criteria as MLIS with
50 per cent for part-time which is against UGC
stipulation. Experienced candidates are preferred for the
part-time. About 15 Universities conduct eligibility test
for research courses to select candidates with aptitude
for research work. The number of admissions relates to
the number of available research guides. Minimum and
maximum allocation of students per guide is reasonable
2 and 6, respectively. The recently established
universities like Pondicherry, KSWU, Kunnur are in the
process to initiate research and yet to expand the
knowledge base of the profession.

5.7 Research Contribution
The research activities of the departments indicates
their contribution to the profession in general. Though
quantitative output is not a measure, the qualitative
contribution does help to assess the constructive
research contribution of the department. Table 2 reveals
the details of research activities of the departments.
The departments are utilising the support of UGC
through major and minor research programmes.
Thirteen departments have undertaken minor research
projects while six are involved in major research
projects. University of Mysore is the leader in research
projects with unique contributions of Prof. Shalini Urs.
Karnataka University, Dharwad has made a distinction
of producing 85 PhDs followed by Annamalai University
with 47 PhDs and 72 MPhils, and Andhra University,
Visakhapatnam, with 54 PhDs and 36 MPhils. The
availability of more research guides may be the reason
for more research output. The research contributions of
all departments are significant as the value of research
lies in the quality than the quantity. However, the major
research contributor in LIS is DRTC. DRTC has the
distinction of research work, from the time of Prof. S.R.
Ranganathan, in classification and other areas to the
present in the areas like digital library, semantic web,
ontologies, etc. A startling revelation from the data is
800 MPhils produced by Madurai Kamaraj University;

Note: R: Regular; DM: Distance mode

may be through distance mode. The positive side of it is
that it indicates the demand for research in LIS but on
the other side it indicates the indiscipline and unwanted
pollution of LIS research.

5.8 Faculty
The quality education depends on the performance
of faculty as their skills to impart knowledge to the
learner are the basis for on campus education system.
Apparently that gives campus programmes an edge over
distance education. UGC has formulated a
comprehensive faculty policy for university education,
with an aim to reach out to the learning needs of
24

students. However, in practice there are several
variations and hurdles.
Teaching pedagogies generally focus on two
aspects—teaching to transmit knowledge, and teaching
to facilitate learning. Both the conceptions demand
teacher’s skills to have efficient learning outcome. The
curriculum indicates what the student has to ‘learn’, but
it is teaching that makes the student to ‘understand’ the
concept and acquire the necessary professional skill. It
is obvious from Table 3 that faculty position is not rosy
in all LIS departments of South India. Though the Andhra
and Mysore University departments have full-fledged
faculty (8), there are departments that are being
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

managed with only 2-3 faculty. Pondicherry University is
an exception among newly established universities with
a faculty strength of six teachers. It is understandable
that the newly started State Universities like BR
Ambedkar University, Etcherla, Srikakulam; Dravidian
University, Kuppam; Karnataka State Women University,
Bijapur; Kunnur University, Kerala, are lagging behind in
having adequate faculty members but the renowned and
well established universities like Madras, Madurai
Kamaraj, Calicut, Kuvempu, and Kakatiya universities
are also suffering with inadequate faculty which hinders
the academic and research work of the departments.
The inadequacy of staff leads to lopsided growth of
departments, hence the matter needs to be taken care
of. Indeed there is a need to revamp the present faculty

structure of the departments. The curricula demands for
inter-disciplinary faculty drawn from computers,
statistics and management sciences. Further, the focus
on practical component in the syllabi suggests for
partnership
between
teaching
and
practicing
professionals to impart the theoretical principles and
practical skills.

5.9 Infrastructure
There is a persistent demand to be proactive to
global developments in knowledge generation,
organisation, and management in digital environment. It
is true that if we do today’s job with yesterday’s tools,
we will be out tomorrow. To achieve the task, students
need to have adequate infrastructure to practice hands-

on and learn to do. Infrastructure is an umbrella term
that encompasses various components. However for the
purpose of the study, data (Table 4) was gathered with
reference
to
computer
laboratory,
knowledge
organisation tools like classification schemes, catalogue
codes, subject headings lists, department library, and
teaching tools.

5.9.1 Computer Laboratory
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
are infused with value as the modern and efficient means
to move in a global environment. LIS education has to
embrace ICTs as part of course content that includes
theoretical and practical aspects to develop automated,
digital or hybrid information environment. The pressure to
integrate technology has left departments to equip with
state-of-the-art computer laboratories. The computer and
Internet connectivity are essential for LIS students in two
ways: (i) to get trained in emerging digital environment
and web-based information services; and (ii) for selflearning.
Table 4 reveals that all the departments have
computer systems and Internet connectivity, their
adequacy is another area of study. There are
departments fortunate to have as many as 73 (Madras)
and 60 (Madurai Kamaraj) computers while there are
departments with 5 (BRA University) and 10 (Calicut,
Kunnur, A.V.M. Pushpam) computers also. There is a
vast difference in the Internet connectivity, which ranges
from 256 kbps to 100 mbps. This indicates that there is
no equal access to computer systems and Internet to
the students.
Departments located in urban areas possess
exemplary computer labs and Internet connectivity, while
those in rural areas are lagging behind. For example,
Pondicherry University offers WiFi facility and each
student has one system to learn and practice and this
facility is not available for the students of BRA
University, Etcherla. This deprives the student from
equal access to learning environment and develops a
divide between rural and urban students. In fact it is
expected that ICTs will minimise the knowledge divide
but the lack of ICT facilities leads to digital divide. This
lead to lack of necessary knowledge, expertise, and
related confidence that indirectly influences the job
market.

5.9.2 Knowledge Organisation Tools
LIS education deals with imparting the means to
identify knowledge and the techniques of its
organisation. The core of LIS is to train students in the
professional skills of knowledge organisation. The
specific training requires adequate tools for teaching/
learning exercise.
26

It is evident from Table 4 that the students are
benefited with latest and adequate knowledge
organisation tools as the departments possess DDC,
UDC (IME), AACR–2, and subject heading lists.
However, adequacy of these is a matter of concern. It is
expected that each students is provided with a set of
tools for practice and also during examination. For
example, Karntaka State Womens University has 50
intake while there are 20 each of DDC and UDC. The
situation is similar in almost all departments. There are
no special grants to the departments to procure the
latest knowledge organisation tools, which may be a
reason for their inadequacy. It can be inferred that there
is differences among the departments in possession of
knowledge organisation tools. There is a need to build
adequate collection of knowledge organisation tools for
in-depth training of the students.

5.9.3 Department Library
Reading the literature makes the student to
understand the subject beyond the curricular boundaries.
Wide reading makes the budding professional perfect
and ignites their creative and innovative thinking. Further,
maintenance of reference collection provides an
opportunity to student to study and evaluate them. The
departments are supposed to maintain a library with
focus on latest collections and within the proximity of the
students as university library collections may not be
adequate.
Table 4 reveals that 50 per cent departments
facilitate their students with library. The collections vary
between 50 (Gulbarga) to 3,800 (Kerala). Six
departments subscribes to periodicals also. However,
the data reveals the variations in providing the facility; 50
per cent of the departments do not have a library. In
many cases the reason is that the department is either
located within the library building or are in close vicinity.
Such departments have provided the collections on LIS
in the main library. Generally the timings of department
libraries and the department’s working hours are same
but libraries have to provide an extended facility.
It can be inferred that the department’s contribution
with regard to department library is insignificant as 50
per cent of the departments are not providing the facility
and those offering have restricted opening hours, and
some even have inadequate collections.

6. SUGGESTIONS
Expansion of LIS education in terms of subject
component, practical skills, intake, and infrastructure,
demands improved efficiency with greater range and
flexibility. LIS education involves interdisciplinary thinking
and action, more collaboration, paradigm shift, and new

culture of accountability. Therefore, assuring and
enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in LIS
teaching is a major concern. The following suggestions
are made based on the study of the LIS courses in
South India offered by 27 institutions:


There can be uniform course pattern. BLIS may be
confined to distance education and colleges.
Campus departments may offer postgraduate
courses with limited enrollment and in-depth
curricula slanted towards professional training.



Though the course content is comprehensive,
being a professional course, practical component

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(5)

must be given 40 per cent share by all departments.
Further the course delivery methods have to be
devised as student centered.


Teaching with educational technologies is very
different from teaching in a conventional classroom.
“Professors must be prepared to communicate
differently and to assert control appropriately in an
online medium. They also need to learn to cultivate
and sustain relationships with their students online,
which can be a time consuming, even tedious,
process but which is also a critical part of online
teaching effectiveness. A competent teacher could
learn how to do all of this ‘on the job’, but the
27

likelihood of failing with several highly visible online
classes through trial-and-error makes that idea very
risky at best”2.




It is necessary to establish collaborative efforts
among Departments of LIS, to develop and share
the learning packages, educational materials and
expertise of the faculty.
All faculty members need to be knowledgeable in
their field of specialisation, suitable to the
technology driven information environment; for this
they have to undergo faculty improvement
programmes. Attitudinal changes among the
trainers is essential to train our products suitably.



Partnership between departments and libraries has
the potential to develop a student beyond the
curriculum. The collaborative approach helps to
overcome the equity limitations and prepares the
student for entry into the field.



Next, faculty exchange programmes within the
state will facilitate optimum utilisation of expert
faculty. Further student exchange programmes
between the departments at least for one week will
broaden their learning perspectives.



Finally, LIS courses have to be integrated with other
courses
on
campus
such
as
statistics
management, computer engineering, and psychology
to avoid duplicate teaching efforts.

7. CONCLUSION
The domain of LIS needs to be redefined to identify
the core jurisdiction of the discipline and its necessary
adaptability in contemporary times. Indeed the need is to
design fresh information science courses keeping in
view the changing knowledge society. The efforts of the
departments in South Indian Universities are significant
but insufficient. It is obvious from the analysis that the
curricula of MS (LIS) programme of DRTC, Bengaluru, is
outstanding with balanced emphasis on all aspects. Of

28

course the advantage lies in the intake as the creamy
layer is opting for this reputed institution. Hence the
need of the hour is to devise uniform eligibility criteria
and selection policy that can really attract those
students with aptitude and attitude for the profession.
