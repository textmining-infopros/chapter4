ABSTRACT
This study attempts to analyse the research profile of biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology
research in India during 1998-2007, country’s performance based on its research output, its publication share
and rank in global context, and annual publication growth rate. It also analyses the share of international
collaborative papers in India’s research output, the characteristics of research output of major Indian institutions,
authors, and highly-cited papers. The patterns of research communication by Indian scientists in most productive
journals in this discipline have also been evaluated.
Keywords: Scientometrics, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology

1. INTRODUCTION
The overlapping disciplines of biochemistry, genetics,
and molecular biology placed between science and
medicine developed rapidly in the early 20th century.
These disciplines occupy a central position in modern
biological research. There has never been a hard line
between these disciplines in terms of content and
technique. Researchers in biochemistry not only use
specific techniques native to biochemistry, but combine
techniques and ideas from genetics and molecular
biology. Similarly, the researchers in molecular biology
not only use specific techniques native to molecular
biology, but combine techniques and ideas from genetics
and biochemistry. Therefore, there is no defined line
between these disciplines.
Biochemistry, soul of life sciences, has a versatile
scope in the field of agriculture, pharmaceutical,
nutritional, and medical sciences. It is the chemistry of
life. It encompasses all aspects of biology, from
molecules to cells, to organisms, to medicine, and to
ecology. It interfaces with biology and chemistry and is
concerned with the chemical processes that take place
within living cells. Modern biochemistry, developed out of
and largely came to replace what in the 19th and early
20th centuries was called physiological chemistry, and
Received on 7 July 2009

began to emerge as an independent discipline from its
medical origins. Thus, biochemistry as such is largely,
though not exclusively, a 20th century discipline. The
understanding of biochemistry has not only laid down the
foundation for biotechnology but also the newer
specialties like genetics. Molecular biology, agricultural
biochemistry, biochemical pharmacology, immunology,
etc. are also emerging from this parent subject.
Molecular biology is the study of biology at molecular
level. It chiefly concerns itself with understanding the
interactions between the various systems of a cell,
including the interaction between DNA, RNA, and protein
biosynthesis. The development of molecular biology is
also the interaction of two disciplines, i.e., biochemistry
and genetics which made considerable progress in the
course of the first 30 years of the 20th century. The late
1950s to the early 1970s was a period of intense research
and institutional expansion for molecular biology, which
had only recently, became a somewhat coherent
discipline.
Genetics is another discipline of biology, which was
developed at the beginning of the 20th century. Genetics
is the study of the effect of genetic differences of
organisms. It is the scientific study of information in living
organisms, how it is encoded within the cell, and how it is
3

transmitted from one generation to the next. Thus,
genetics is essentially an understanding of fundamental
biological processes such as evolution. It is a rapidly
expanding applied field with new applications being
discovered daily.

5. ANALYSIS

2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE

The Indian research output, its growth rate,
publication share, and rank of India and top 30 countries
in biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology during
1998-2007 have been analysed and presented in Tables 1
and 2. Among these top 30 countries USA published
highest paper with 31.86 per cent share in the cumulative
publication productivity of the world. Japan come at the
2nd place with 9.19 per cent publications share, followed
by Germany (7.44 per cent), France (5.43 per cent),
China (5.04 per cent), Italy (4.34 per cent), Canada (4.04
per cent).

Tianwei He1, et al., studied the research activities of
China in biochemistry and molecular biology, during 19992002 in national and global context based on Science
Citation Index expanded. Patra and Chand2 analysed
Indian biotechnology research by analysing its research
profile, active authors, institutions and state-wise
distributions of Indian biotechnology research output.
Molatudi and Pouris3 made a bibliometric analysis of
South African microbiology, molecular biology, and
genetics research, during 1980-2000 based on ISI
database.

3. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this study is to analyse the
research performance of India in biochemistry, genetics,
and molecular biology in national and global context
during 1998-2007. In particular, the study focuses on the
following objectives:
(i)

To study the research output, publication share,
rank, and growth rate of India’s publication
productivity and 30 most productive countries of the
world.

(ii)

To study the patterns of research collaboration.

(iii) To study the publication productivity and impact of
leading institutions of India.
(iv) To study the characteristics of prolific authors and
highly cited papers.
(v)

To study the patterns of research communication in
most productive Indian and foreign journals.

4. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCE OF DATA
For this study, the data has been retrieved from the
Scopus database, which is the single largest
multidisciplinary bibliographical database in the world. In
data in biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology
published during 1999-2008, India was compared with the
research output of 30 most productive countries of the
world. Three-year citations window was used for counting
the citations received per paper and to assess the impact
of leading Indian institutions and most productive authors.
Impact factor 2006 has been used to examine the impact
of various national and international journals in which
Indian research communication has been published.

5.1 Research Output, Publication Share,
and Growth Rate of Research in India
in Global context

India’s place in this list was 10th with publication
output of 45,712 papers and global publication shareof
2.37 per cent in the cumulative publication output. India’s
global publications share also increased from 1.77 per
cent to 3.07 per cent and so also the global publication
rank from 14th in 1998 to 9th in 2007. India’s annual
publication growth rate was 11.50 per cent during 19982007, which rose to 16.96 per cent during 2003-2007
(Table 2).
It was also observed that publication productivity of
most of the developed countries decreased in global
context. The countries, which showed decrease in their
global output share from 1998 to 2007, were USA, Japan,
Germany, France, Netherlands, UK, Russia, Sweden,
Switzerland and Belgium. In contrast, only few developed
countries such as Italy, Canada, Spain, Australia, Poland,
Denmark, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, and Norway
showed marginal increase (between 0.04 per cent to 0.72
per cent) in their global share during the same period
(Table 2).
As against developed countries, most developing
countries among 30 most productive countries showed
increase in their global output share (between 0.15 per
cent to 7.47 per cent) from 1998 to 2007. China had
substantially improved its global publication share and
publication rank from 12th in 1998 to 2nd in 2007.
Similarly, India also improved its global publication rank
from 14th in 1998 to 9th in 2007 (Table 2). The average
annual publication growth rate of developed countries
ranged between 0 per cent to 11 per cent, as compared to
the developing countries which ranged between 3 per cent
to 25 per cent during 1998-2007.

5.2 Status of India’s International Collaboration
During 1998-2007, it was found that the share of
international collaborative papers with India to its

India witnessed rise in their share of international
collaborative papers from 16.18 per cent during 1998-2000
to 18.38 per cent during 2005-2007 (Table 3).
Table 3 shows that 21 countries have published more
than 100 collaborative papers with India during this period.
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(1)

Of these 21 countries, 14 belong to the developed world
and seven to developing world. USA was the largest
collaborative partner with 43.55 per cent publications
share in India’s cumulative international collaborative
papers output during 1998-2007, followed by Germany
(with 13.33 per cent), UK (with 12.98 per cent), Japan
(8.01 per cent), France (5.95 per cent), Canada (4.39 per
cent), Italy (3.52 per cent share) and so on. Among
5

developing countries, Malaysia contributed the highest
share (4.64 per cent) with India, followed by South Korea
(2.61 per cent), China (2.11 per cent), Taiwan (1.93 per
cent), Israel (1.69 per cent), Singapore (1.50 per cent),
and Columbia (1.30 per cent) (Table 4) of collaborative
papers

These 20 institutions together contributed 40.91 per cent
in the total publication productivity of India during 19982007; rising from 14.15 per cent in 1998-2002 to 26.76 per
cent in 2003-2007. The cumulative publication output of
these 20 institutions constitutes 18,702 papers with an
average output of 935.1 papers per institution. Only six
institutions, namely, Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore (2433 papers), University of Delhi, Delhi (1989
papers); AIIMS, Delhi (1291 papers); Indian Institute of
Chemical Technology, Hyderabad (1239 papers);
