ABSTRACT
The study examines Indias performance based on its publication output in immunology and microbiology
during 1999-2008, based on several parameters, including the countrys annual average growth rate, global
publications share and rank, institutional profile of select top 15 institutions, international collaboration profile
and major collaborative partners, patterns of communication in national and international journals, and
characteristics of its top 15 most productive authors. The study uses 10 years publications data in immunology
and microbiology drawn from Scopus international multidisciplinary bibliographical database.
Keywords: Immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, cell biology, microorganisms, DNA technology

INTRODUCTION

The world around us is full of organisms, which are
too small to be seen with the naked eye. Microbiologists
study these tiny life forms. The major groups of microbes
are bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and protozoa.
Microbes live in widely diverse habitats ranging from hot
springs, human body, and the depths of the ocean. They
affect each and every aspect of life on earth. Microbiology
is not a single subject. It has many areas of
specialisation. However, it is a science based on the use
of pure cultureslooking at one sort of organism at a
time. Many of the techniques developed by microbiologists are now used in molecular and cell biology to
provide the basis for studying higher organisms.
Microorganisms also play a central role in recombinant
DNA technology and act as the agents for genetic
modification. In India, microbiology is an important area of
education and research under biological sciences.
A number of universities and colleges are offering
courses at BSc and MSc level in microbiology as well as
facilities for doctoral research. Besides universities and
colleges, a number of research institutes are engaged in
R&D work in this area. Immunology is study of of all
aspects of the immune system including its structure and
Received on 25 March 2009

functional disorders of the immune system, blood
banking, immunisation, and organ transplantation. It is
the study of viruses, at the molecular level, in relationship
with the immune system. It means studying how viruses
interact with the immune system at the structural level
(not studying virus epidemics; rather, the shape of viruses
and how they interact with the molecular structure of the
immune system). Immunology as a subject of study is
concentrated in medical colleges and few universities and
is taught as a part of medical degrees.
A number of research institutes, which are part of
CSIR, ICMR,. DBT, and DST also focus their R&D work in
this area. The universities and research institutes besides
their own funds, gets extramural research funds from
research agencies such as CSIR, ICMR, DST, DBT to
carry out research in microbiology and immunology from
time to time. Rao [1] had provided a review of the evolution
of immunology in India. Similarly, evaluation studies of
different subject fields based on their Indian publication
output have been carried out by one of the authors in
collaboration with other scholars in the field of condensed
matter physics, materials science, computer science and
pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics covering
different time periods [2-5].

OBJECTIVES

The main focus of the study is: (i) to analyse the
status, publication share, rank and growth of Indias
research output among the top 15 productive countries in
immunology and microbiology; (ii) to analyse productivity
and quality of Indian research output in immunology and
microbiology; (iii) to analyse the productivity and quality of
15 major institutions participating in research in
immunology and microbiology; (iv) to analyse the pattern
of research collaboration in immunology and
microbiology; and (v) to analyse the productivity and
quality of leading 15 authors in research in immunology
and microbiology.

METHODOLOGY

The study uses 10 years publications data from 1999
to 2008 on India in the area of immunology and
microbiology as defined in Scopus database
classification. In addition, it used citations data for
measuring quality and visibility of Indian research output.
Three years, two year and one year citations windows
have been used for computing average citations per paper
by India in immunology and microbiology during 19992005, 2006 and 2007.

4. ANALYSIS
As reflected in the Scopus database, India published
13,172 research papers during 1999-2008 in immunology
and microbiology, with an average output of 1317 papers
per year. The cumulative output of India increased from
4669 papers during 1999-03 to 8503 papers during 20042008 showing a growth rate of 82.12 per cent. The average
citation per paper recorded on a three-year citation
window by India was 3.15 during 1999-2008. The average
citation per paper decreased from 3.97 during 1999-2003
to 2.98 during 2004-08 (Table 1).

India was ranked 12th among the top 15 productive
countries of the world in immunology and microbiology,
with its global publications share of 2.50 per cent as
computed from cumulative world publications output data
for 1999-2008. India has shown rise in its global
publications share, rising from 1.67 per cent to 3.70 per
cent from the year 1999 to the year 2008.
Correspondingly, Indias world ranking improved from 15th
position in 1999 to 9th in 2008 (Table 2). India achieved an
annual average growth rate of 12.19 per cent per annum
during 1999-2008, the second highest after China
amongst the top 15 most productive countries (Tables 2, 3
and 4).

4.1 Institutional Profile
Based on publications output data for India in
immunology and microbiology, a total of 15 institutions
were identified as high productive ones publishing more
than 160 papers in the country during 1999-2008. These
top 15 institutions together contributed 3664 papers (with
27.82 per cent share) in the total cumulative research
output by India during 1999-2008 (Table 5).
The share of these top 15 institutions in the total
Indian research output has decreased from 31.08 per cent
(1451 papers) in 1999-03 to 26.03 per cent (2213 papers)
during 2004-08. These institutions individually published
between 179 and 476 papers in 10 years (1999-2008),
with an average output of 244 papers per institution. Of
these, five institutions each contributed publications
output above the 15 institutions average (244 papers per
institution). These five institutions along with their

Sciences, New Delhi with 468 papers, followed by
Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi (352 papers), Post
Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research,
Chandigarh (319 papers), Indian Institute of Science,
Bengaluru (297 papers), and Indian Veterinary Research
Institute, Izatnagar (265 papers) (Table 5).
The average growth rate of the top 15 Indian
institutions from 1999-03 to 2004-08 was 52.52 per cent.
Seven Indian institutions achieved higher growth rate than
the average growth rate of the top 15 Indian institutions

publications data for 1999-2008 showing a rise in its
global publications share from 1.67 per cent to 3.70 per
cent during 1999 to 2008. Correspondingly, Indias world
ranking improved from 15th position in 1999 to 9th in 2008.
India achieved an annual average growth rate of 12.19 per
cent per annum during 1999-2008, the second highest
after China amongst the top 15 most productive countries.
The cumulative output of India increased from 4669
papers during 1999-03 to 8503 papers during 2004-08,
showing a growth rate of 82.12 per cent. The average
