ABSTRACT
This paper attempts to study the perceptions, knowledge and awareness among the health professionals
(doctors and MBBS students only) working in government hospitals of Chandigarh regarding the use of mobile
communication technologies and devices for dissemination of various library and information services on the
basis of a survey. The survey finds out the commonly used mobile devices among health professionals, their
purpose of use and the methods and type of communication channel used in mobile devices for exchanging
information among the doctors and students. The paper also seeks their opinion about library and information
services, if provided through mobile technologies, and kinds of services, which could be provided, their
feasibility, benefits and drawbacks along with the awareness among the users about such services. The
findings of this survey show the positive attitude of the medical respondents towards the provision of library
and information services on mobile devices.
Keywords: M-information, m-library services, medical libraries, mobile communication, mobile devices

1. INTRODUCTION
Mobile communications technology, over recent
years, has become an integral part of everyday life with
individuals viewing this method of communication as a
necessity rather than a luxury. The impact of mobile
technologies can be seen in all aspects of lives and in
many sectors like business, education, banking,
communication, health, libraries, etc. Libraries and
information centres are providing various services through
these technologies to meet the information needs of its
users worldwide particularly in the advanced countries.
The continued trend of the convergence of technological
devices and the advent of third generation phones have
provided increased speed of data transfer and further
opportunities for both librarians and library users to
access and exchange information whilst on the move.
At present many libraries in western countries are
providing various information services and making the
access to reference sources available on the mobile

devices for their users. In the health sciences field, library
of the University of Alberta offers a vast array of health
science related reference services and access to other
library sources to its users on mobile devices.1 Some
university libraries have begun to make electronic
versions of their library catalogues available for access on
mobile devices. The North Carolina State University
(NCSU) MobiLIB catalogue interface, for example, is
optimised for mobile devices.2 Similarly the website
developed at Simmons College Library provides links to
the libraries particularly in medicine and health sciences,
and their library source contents and different type of
library services for mobile devices.3

2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Walton, Childs and Blenkinsopp explored the
potential of mobile technologies for accessing learning
resources4 among health students. Karim, Darus and
Hussin explored the utilisation of mobile phone services in
the educational environment and the perception of
7

university students in Malaysia on mobile phone uses in
library and information services.5 Lippincott explored the
implications of mobile technologies for academic libraries
users.6 Ryerson University library has done cell phone
survey to make informed decisions about the provision of
library services via mobile devices.7 University of
Cambridge in a project, based on the online survey of the
users, identified and explored the ways that libraries
could develop the library services based on mobile
devices and supports the mobile information needs of the
people.8

responses, under different mobile devices, the result will
be more than 186 responses. Similarly, the response
under different purposes, types of information exchanged
and communication channels used will be more than the
cumulative responses.
The analysis of doctors’ perceptions and students’
perceptions has been done separately to make the
comparison between them. The term health professionals
includes a number of categories of staff like nurses,
paramedical staff, counsellors, medical social workers,
clinical psychologists, play therapist, students, doctors,
etc. But the scope of this study is limited to the MBBS
students and doctors only (including Faculty, Senior
Residents, Postgraduate Junior Residents, Junior
Residents, Demonstrators, and Senior Medical Officers).
Further, this study was limited to the three government
hospitals in Chandigarh.

3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the study are: (i) to identify the
commonly used mobile devices, purpose of their use and
type of communication channel used; (ii) to study the
point of view of the users about the feasibility of providing
mobile library and information services; (iii) to study the
opinion of users about the benefits and drawbacks of
providing library services using mobile devices; (iv) to
make the assessment of awareness among doctors
about the availability of such library services; and (v) to
compare the perceptions of doctors and medical students
about the mobile services.

5. ANALYSIS
5.1 Use of Mobile Device
The analysis of the responses shows that all the
respondents including 146 doctors and 40 MBBS
students were using one or more than one mobile
devices; the commonly used devices were mobile
phones, laptops, and pen drives (Table 1). Among the type
of mobile devices, mobile phones were the most
commonly used device among doctors and students
followed by laptops, pen drives, i-pods, etc. E-book reader
was the hardly used device.

4. METHODOLOGY AND SCOPE OF STUDY
The study is based on the survey conducted through a
structured close questionnaire distributed among the 200
medical professionals including 160 doctors and 40
MBBS students of three government hospitals in
Chandigarh, i.e., Post Graduate Institute of Medical
Education and Research (PGIMER), Govt Medical
College and Hospital (GMCH), and Govt Multi Specialty
Hospital (GMSH). Of these 200 questionnaires, 186 (93
per cent) questionnaires were received back including 146
(91.25 per cent) from doctors and 40 (100 per cent) from
students. The respondents used more than one mobile
device for various purposes. So, if we count the total

doctors used mobile devices for education purposes,
reading e-books, and journal articles. The last two being
the least common purposes among students.

(MMS) were the least favoured communication channels
among the total respondents. SMS and data files were
fairly used communication channels among doctors for
exchanging information.

5.3 Type of Information Exchanged
Figure 1 shows that messages were the information
exchanged less among doctors than students. On
comparing the dominant responses of doctors and
students, it was found that doctors were using mobile
devices for exchanging educational information and files
as against the students who exchanged songs, jokes,
and photos.

5.4 Use of Mobile Communication Channel
Figure 2 shows that e-mail was the most common
channel of communication among doctors in contrast to
short message service (SMS), which was widely used by
the students. URL and Multimedia Messaging Service

5.5 Mobile Library and Information Services
Table 3 shows the respondent’s views on providing
library information services on mobile devices and its
types. With regard to type of information services that can
be provided through mobile devices, majority of doctors
showed their preference for List of New Arrivals, followed
by E-journal Article, Renewal of Books, Reservation of
Books, Information of Library Timings, Library News and
so on. Among students, there was marked preference for
List of New Arrivals, followed by Library News, Renewal of
Book, Information of Library Timings and Web Clippings,
and so on. Text Reference Service is less preferred by the
doctors than the students.

library and information services are being provided by
many libraries, particularly in advanced countries of the
world. Fifty two per cent of doctors and 57.50 per cent of
students showed awareness about the availability of meditions of reference sources like encyclopedia and
dictionaries. With regard to the availability of Pubmed on

Doctors were using mobile devices mainly for making
phone calls, transferring data and for education
purposes in contrast to the students for whom the
main purpose was mainly making phone calls and
listening the music.
Messages, songs and jokes were the most common
types of information exchanged among students,
while doctors exchanged messages and educational
information. E-mail, SMS, and data files were the
preferable communication channels among doctors
while SMS was the only communication channel used
by the students.
In the opinion of respondents, 69.18 per cent doctors
and 50 per cent students agreed that LIS services can
be provided through mobile devices. More than 50 per
cent doctors thought that library and information
services like new arrivals, e-journal articles, book
renewal, book reservation, library timings, and library
news can be provided on mobile devices.
Only 50.68 per cent doctors and 37.50 per cent
students were aware about the mobile library
information services provided by libraries in other
countries and more than 50 per cent respondents
were aware about mobile editions of reference
sources. Awareness about availability of Pubmed on
m-devices was very less among the respondents.
