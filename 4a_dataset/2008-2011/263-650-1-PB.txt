ABSTRACT
Financial crunch and ever rising cost of journals have constrained many scientific/research libraries,
especially the medical libraries, to satiate the demands of the users forcing them adopt to new technologies
to overcome the challenge of ever rising information demands of the users. In the recent years, library
consortium has emerged as a viable solution for resource sharing among libraries. This paper is an overview
of the consortia initiated by the Indian Council of Medical Research to share the resources of its medical
libraries among its 25 institutes.
Keywords: Library consortia, medical resources, medical researchers, medical libraries, e-consortia, national
health priorities, information and communication technologies

Information is considered a vital resource for
communication/dissemination of knowledge of one
individual to another from the early stages of human
civilisation, and has therefore become an inevitable
element of all human activities and development. The
rapid progress of information technology now tries to
satisfy the information needs of the human being in
diverse manner. The expression of information, in
multidimensional form and voluminous development has
necessitated the libraries to adopt new philosophies and
technologies for collection, and development, reduce the
cost of information, and to eliminate the duplicity. It is
equally true, as well as applicable for all types of libraries/
information centres not to hold the full stock of information
resources or to procure all information, which may be in
demand by its users; not a single library/information
centre can meet the thrust of knowledge of all the readers
from its stock of information to the fullest extent. To
overcome this problem, libraries started cooperation
through library networks, document delivery, inter-library
loans, etc. Library consortium has now come into
existence as a more accepted system of resource
sharing among libraries with a wide coverage.

subscribe to all the required journals and databases.
Libraries formed consortia to overcome the problem and
share the resources. Sharing electronic resources have
become necessity of individual libraries due to their
decreasing excellence. Libraries in consortia have
discovered that as a group, they have a combined set of
resources of a single library. Membership in a consortium
allows a group of libraries to pool their financial resources
to leverage greater control over market place. Consortia
enable the library to improve quality of services offered to
their patrons by enhancing collections and by increasing
access to information. Some special libraries and
organisations like the Indian Institute of Astrophysics
(IIA), Inter University Centre for Astronomy and
Astrophysics (IUCAA), National Centre for Radio
Astrophysics (NCRA), Physical Research Laboratory
(PRL), Raman Research Institute (RRI), Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research (TIFR), Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR), Indian Council of Medical
Research (ICMR), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE),
National Medical Library (NML) under Director General
Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare (MOHFW) have established consortia to share
electronic access to journal literature [1].

INTRODUCTION

NEED OF LIBRARY CONSORTIUM

Due to financial crunch and the rising costs of
journals, many research/scientific libraries cannot

ABOUT ICMR

The Indian Council of Medical Research, the apex
body in India for the formulation of biomedical research,
7

was founded in 1911, and is one of the oldest medical
research bodies in the world. As early as in 1911, the
Government of India set up the Indian Research Fund
Association (IRFA) with the objectives of supporting and
coordinating the various medical researches in India. It
was renamed as Indian Council of Medical Research in
1949. The Councils research priorities coincide with the
national health priorities such as control and
management of communicable diseases; fertility control,
maternal and child health; control of nutritional disorders;
developing alternative strategies for health care delivery,
containment within safety limits of environmental and
occupational health problems; research on major noncommunicable diseases like cancer, cardiovascular
diseases, blindness, diabetes and other metabolic and
hematological disorders; and mental health research and
drug research. All these efforts are undertaken with a view
to reduce the total burden of disease and to promote
health and wellbeing of the population. The Council
promotes biomedical research in the country through
intramural as well as extramural research.
In this digitally-enabled world, the convergence of
information and communication technologies (ICTs), the
web, and the Internet are the most striking developments.
The whole world is converting into a Global Electronic
Village as the traditional constraints of time and space
are disappearing. The globalisation of information is
taking place and territorial boundaries are becoming
meaningless due to developments in ICTs. In present
scenario, there are many ways available for accessing
and dissemination of information to the users. A
consortium is the best way to fulfill all the requirement of
the users. ICMR has undertaken various activities to help
address the challenges of digital technology to research
scholars/scientists. ICMR has initiated two types of
consortia: (i) JCCC@ICMR which covers all ICMR
subscribed journals and full text of over 200 free journals,
and (ii) ICMR e-consortia which provides full text of
subscribed e-journals only [2].

JCCC-ICMR is an extension of JCC for a group of
homogenous consortia members of the ICMR. It was
started in 2004 and covers 1047 journals received
collectively at 25 institutes/centres of the ICMR. In
addition, around 189 open access journals are also
covered. In all, journals from 448 publishers are covered
on a single platform. As it is always a daunting task to
locate an article or journal from the collection of more than
one library. For the faster retrieval of details regarding a
particular journal or the article, it is difficult to rely on
manual technique. ICMR with the help of Informatics India
took the initiative to provide a common access point to its
different libraries and information centres, so that they
can know what the other libraries of the Council are
subscribing and at the same time also increases the
usage of these sources among the Councils libraries. All
the 25 ICMRs libraries and information centres are the
members of JCCC@ICMR and reaping its benefits.
JCCC@ICMR was launched on 27 July 2004. Presently,
JCCC@ICMR is providing a single point access (updated
weekly) to around 1047 journals out of which 858 journals
are subscribed by 25 ICMRs network of library and
information centres and 189 are open access (free)
biomedical journals. Institute-wise contact persons for the
JCCC@ICMR are given in Appendix 1.
Scientists of ICMR can now access the full text and
the abstracts of all the journals available free on the
platform. The scientists can easily locate the journal of
their interest from the journals subscribed by the member
library and if they find any article then by using the same
platform they can send an e-mail request to that particular
library of the consortia. JCCC@ICMR is a bibliographic
database of print and electronic journals that the member
libraries are subscribing. It provides a common platform
for all the members to have an access of detail regarding
the availability of journals. After locating the article,
request can be made by clicking the hard copy button.

MISSION OF JCCC-ICMR

3.1 JCCC@ICMR
(http://www.jcccicmr@informindia.co.in)

v

To provide a common gateway to e-journals for the
participating members of the consortium.

J-Gate Custom Content (JCC) acts as a bibliographic
database and provides single access point for searching
the locally subscribed journals, both print and electronic.
This is based on Ranganathans local documentation list.
The major advantage of JCC is its ability to maximise the
usage of the journals subscribed by the library. It provides
access to all the print and electronic journals to the users
under a single platform. J-Gate Custom Content for
Consortia (JCCC) is an extension for library consortia. It is
a shareable bibliographic database between the member
institutes which allows the members of the consortia to
access the full text and the incorporated union catalogue
of the journals managed by the Informatics India Ltd [3].

v

To provide a common access and search interface for
all journals subscribed by the consortium members.

v

To provide an insured and dependable journal archive
source for the consortium members.

5.

SIGNIFICANCE OF JCCC-ICMR

v

Common access to table of content (TOC) and full
text articles for 1047 journals.

v

Common TOC and Database search facility for print
and online journals, which have scholarly content and
are subscribed by the consortium members.

ICMR E-CONSORTIA

by

each

ICMR e-consortia was started in 2007. ICMR initially
subscribed few e-journals in a consortia mode for all ICMR
Institutes. All the scientists of ICMR and its institutes can
access these journals from their desktop.

6.1 Salient Features of ICMR E-Consortia
v

Journals can be accessed through IP addresses of
the various institutes libraries including HQ.

v

Several user awareness meetings were organized to
promote the use of these journals.

v

Back volumes of Lancet (1996), BMJ (1994), NEJM
(1993), Nature (1997), and Science (1997) are also
available online.

6.2 Usage
Availability of the e-consortia among ICMR network of
libraries has enabled scientists to access the journals
from their desktop. As per the latest usage statistics,
usage of journal literature has been increasing every year.
The interaction among ICMR librarians has increased a lot
and dissemination of information in a more organised and
efficient manner.

CONCLUSION

The unending responsibility of libraries is collection
development, preservation, retrieval of information for
providing the library service to the users. These

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

responsibilities have become more complex with the
introduction
of
computer
and
communication
technologies in libraries. In a developing country like
India, different steps are being taken to disseminate
information more or less in all subject areas, especially in
science and technology.
Any set of objectives will only be achieved, if there is
a willingness to join together and to believe that more will
be achieved through the efforts of everyday than at the
individual level. According to Allen Kent, The success
and survival of libraries will much depend on how much
and to what extent the libraries cooperate with each other
in future. So, cooperation is an essential facet of modern
library management in most developed countries of the
world, but our country is still in the normative stage.
Tremendous explosion of information, financial
constraints, information in different forms, etc., have
necessitated resource sharing networking as an
important alternative.
In the light of the above, establishment of better
consortium, integrating intellectual access are all the
important steps for moving towards the 21st century
libraries. Indian librarians should seriously rethink and
reinitiate consortium movement like western countries for
maximum utilisation of resources at a reduced cost, time,
and space.
