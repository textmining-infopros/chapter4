ABSTRACT
Spacenet is a Closed User Group (CUG)-based communication network of Department of Space/Indian
Space Research Organisation (ISRO) catering to a variety of space community needs. It offers wide range
of potential benefits both to libraries and end-users across the ISRO centres in India. Over a decade, Spacenet
has evolved as a community network for the space community in India. The paper explains how the resources
of various ISRO information centres are shared/utilised, digital libraries (DL) built, accessed, and institutional
repositories (IRs) organised among the libraries using Spacenet.
Keywords: Spacenet, intranets, institutional repositories, digital library services, ISRO, NRSA

1. INTRODUCTION
The primary objectives of Department of Space (DoS)
is promotion of space science, technology, and
applications towards achieving self-reliance and assist
the nation in telecommunication, broadcasting,
meteorology, education, remote sensing, etc. The human
resource strength of the department is 16,912 (scientific/
technical: 11057, and administrative: 5135). Over the last
three decades, satellite-based communication and
remote sensing technologies have demonstrated their
capabilities to provide services related to education,
healthcare, weather, land, and water resources
management, mitigation of impact of natural disasters,
etc. The continuing expansion of space application
programmes like Village Resources Centres,
telemedicine, tele-education, disaster management
support, and outreach through Direct-to-Home Television,
reiterates the increasing role played by the Indian space
systems in providing direct benefits to the society and for
national development [1].

2. WHAT IS SPACENET?
Spacenet is a closed user group (CUG)-based
communication network of Department of Space/Indian
Space Research Organisation (ISRO) catering to a variety
of needs of space community. It is a multimedia network
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

using latest technology for transmission of data like
audio, video through the same network simultaneously.
Spacenet has contributed immensely in several space
application programmes. It offers a wide range of potential
benefits both to libraries and end-users across the ISRO
Centres in the country. It provides multiple simultaneous
access to the digital content, remote access, OPAC
search facilities, multimedia capabilities, data
compression, usage statistics, low-cost resource
sharing, and availability of information on 24/7 basis, etc.

2.1 Configuration and Infrastructure
Spacenet configuration has been implemented by
using VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) network,
which is highly reliable and cost-effective. The network is
flexible in terms of providing Star or Mesh. Its networking
architecture provides easy expansion capability both in
terms of adding new stations or incorporating additional
facilities in the existing stations.
The hub station of Spacenet is located at ISTRAC,
Bengaluru, and remote stations at 44 different Centres/
Units of ISRO/DoS across the country (Fig.1).
The network is a new generation network with end-toend IP-based system with quality services and features
for audio, video, and data. The hub station of Spacenet

comprises a 6.3 m antenna with program tracking facility.
The network uses TDMA technology with bandwidthefficient Star/Mesh topology.

3. SPACENET SERVICES
Video Conference Service (VCS): Spacenet provides
group video conferencing facility allowing people of
different Centres/Units of ISRO/DoS to meet face to face
for exchanging information. It helps making
presentations, discussing various project related issues,
reviewing progress of various projects, discussing
management/administrative issues, etc. and thus
drastically reduces information turnaround time.
Voice/Fax: Voice services are operated in Star/Mesh
mode satellite connectivity. Exchanges at respective
Centres/Units are directly connected to modem with Type
V four wire E&M/FXS interface [2].
Intranet Services: Intranet services among all
Centres/Units are realised by dedicated data channels. It
is operated in Star mode. Intranet uses the standard welldefined technologies available in Internet through the
corporate LAN. Any individual or department can interact
with other individual or department via E-mail, FTP and
Web browsing. Bulk data transfer between any two
locations is also available. Besides, Spacenet also
provides bulletin boards and newsletter services also [3].

4. SPACENET: A COMMUNITY NETWORK
Community information is information targeted for a
specific group which may belong to a government,
academic institutions or a commercial organisation not
restricted in a geographical area. The information and
services delivered through these systems will cover wide
information needs and specific ways of accessing
information. The community information networks are
4

locally focused and can exist on the Internet or on
Intranet. Some community networks provide limited
services like a portal or home-based information, while
others provide Internet access, training, educational
programmes, e-learning, etc. Sharing in Spacenet,
because of classified and restricted nature of information,
is restricted only among ISRO community and not open
to the public.

4.1 Infrastructure of Local Network Facility at
ISRO Centres
Each Centre, situated in a different geographical
location, has a minimum of 50 to 1000 terminals having
connectivity with 100 to 1000 Mbps with high-speed
multiprocessor servers and powerful workstations for high
data transfer rate over Spacenet [4].

5. ISRO LIBRARIES:FROM TRADITIONAL TO
HYBRID LIBRARIES
ISRO libraries, with their specialised collection and
services and keeping their information needs in view, have
rapidly transformed over the past two decades into hybrid
libraries with print and digital collection. ISRO libraries
quickly moved from ‘transaction’ to ‘interaction’ by
adopting modern technologies in bringing out various
information products and other housekeeping services to
the desktops of end users over Spacenet. On the existing
Intranet, seven libraries have created their own web page
to disseminate general information and services to their
users. As part of digital library initiatives, most libraries
offer access to digital report literature of the Centre and
also to a sizable collection of commercially acquired
digital resources. ISRO libraries are continuously
engaged in exchanging various resources, viz., print,
electronic, internally generated via file transfer, Fax, etc.,
for the benefits of the users.

SPACENET: A BOON TO ISRO LIBRARIES

The library and information services and collections
of each centre are specialised with respect to their
projects. ISRO internally generates enormous amount of
information in the form of lectures/speeches delivered by
the eminent personalities of ISRO, documentary films,
internal reports, re-prints, pre-prints, conference
proceedings, conference papers, etc. These documents
are archived and made available in digital form to all users
across ISRO using Spacenet.

Spacenet include:


A single interface and access point.



Effective document delivery systems.



Enhanced search facilities.



Reduced storage costs.



Scope for electronic archives.



Monitoring of usage statistics.



Access to otherwise un-subscribed material.

6.1 ISRO Libraries’ Websites



Developing common resources databases.

The websites of ISRO libraries can be accessed via a
link provided in the Spacenet. The portal describes a
variety of web-based interfaces where users can easily
access the library resources and services through a
single access. The library information resources and
services are accessed within the campus and the same
can be accessed by ISRO/DoS community all over India
through Spacenet.



Increased user base due to pushing information to
desktops.



General information about library, acquisition,
circulars, collection, cooperating libraries, services,
working hours, etc.



E-resources like OPAC, journals, e-books, Internet
pathfinder, space related sites, digital library,
institutional repositories, etc.

6.2 Benefits of the Spacenet
Prior to introduction of Spacenet, libraries depended
on the traditional methods like Fax, telephone, post,
courier, etc. for exchanging the information within the
ISRO. Spacenet, has now made video conferencing
possible across the various ISRO Centres. ISRO’s
libraries started using Spacenet for exchanging resources
in an effective way. Content distribution online has
become easier using FTP access. This has resulted in
remarkable increase in the user strength and also
enormous savings of money and time. Other benefits of

6.3 Digital Libraries at ISRO
The resources at ISRO libraries are heterogeneous in
nature. ISRO libraries have played a major role in
providing information support efficiently and effectively to
its centres throughout India using Intranet. While ISRO
has a common goal to push the benefits of space
research to the common man, the information needs of
space scientists/technologists differ from each centre
and are project-specific. To meet these demands from the
users, each library had built a digital library (DL) using
5

DSpace supplementing their rich print collection with a
common strategy to share these resources using
Spacenet and various open source software. ISRO HQ,
Space Application Centre (SAC), and ISRO Satellite
Centre (ISAC) have created DL using Greenstone open
source software developed by Southampton University.
Similar DL initiatives are in progress at few other ISRO
libraries.
Conference
proceedings,
pre-prints,
documentary films, news items related to ISRO, science
and technology and other related topics are hosted in
digital form. Facilities like browsing, searching,
downloading of news items daily from websites, national
newspapers, and hosting on the digital library are also
available. ISRO libraries have established the digital
information system in a multi-user environment. Access
to information, search and retrieval from client nodes is
made easy with Graphical User Interface (GUI) through
web-based browser. DL at ISRO Centres are hosted on
individual Intranet sites along with OPAC and other
services on library home page. At present, all DL allow
searching locally and collect the search results over
Spacenet [5].

7.

FUTURE PLANS

Most of the above mentioned services are read-only
hypertext systems. It is a sort of broadcasting information
to ISRO community about available services and
products. Users can read what library offers. Initiatives
have been taken to market, and also to provide access to
the content and services on 24/7 basis to create virtual
libraries through a host of free and inexpensive Web 2.0/
Library 2.0 tools such as blogs, wikis, RSS aggregators,
pod casts, vodcasts, web conferencing, and instant
messaging, etc. It is also planned to have federated
search engine for research and retrieval of results for
ISRO Libraries Information Systems, where users receive
one common list of search results and are directed to the
DL where the selected item is actually stored [6].

8.

CONCLUSION

The role of Spacenet in the DoS is very significant. It
continues to extend its networking support to several
space application areas in general and to information
centres of ISRO in particular. Libraries of ISRO are
coming closer than ever and trying to explore new ways
and means to strengthen their information support to
space scientists and technologists using Spacenet. A
step towards this direction is the community portals of
ISRO libraries specially designed to provide a gateway to
a wide spectrum of information resources and services to
the end users to have cost-effective resource over
Spacenet. Each portal acts as a one-stop information
solution to the library resources and services to the entire
spectrum of space community. ISRO libraries are being
geared to adopt the latest web technologies in networking
in the years to come for optimum utilisation of resources.
