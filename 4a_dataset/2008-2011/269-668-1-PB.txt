ABSTRACT
Library is considered an integral component of any efficient education system. It plays an important role
in the improvement of the organisation. This study, which was conducted in minority aided degree colleges,
reveals the nature and the extent of use of college libraries in Andhra Pradesh. It evaluates in detail the type
of material, sources and the services used by the students. It also assesses the extent of students satisfaction
regarding collection, timings and library staff cooperation in finding the information.
Keywords: Minority colleges, Andhra Pradesh, libraries, libraries services

INTRODUCTION

Education aims to impart knowledge and make good
citizens. Libraries are the repositories of knowledge and
form an integral part of education. Education is the
process by which people not only acquire knowledge,
information, and skills, but also values and the ability to
live and interact within and with social groups. Higher
education contributes to human resource development in
many ways. Institutions of higher education have the main
responsibility of training students who participate in the
development of the country. Libraries have a long history;
starting with the chained and closed-access libraries of
earlier times to the present hybrid, digital, and virtual
libraries that use the latest technology for imparting
information through various services. With the advent of
information and communication technologies (ICTs) the
nature of libraries has changed drastically. Computers are
being used in libraries to process, store, retrieve, and
disseminate information. As a result, the traditional
concept of library is being redefined from a place to house
books in print to one which provides access to information
in the most advanced media including CD-ROM, Internet,
and remote access to a wide range of resources. Libraries
have now metamorphosed into hybrid institutions with a
blend of print and digital information resources. Gone are
the days when a library was judged by its quantitative
resources. Today, libraries are surrounded by networked
data that is connected to vast ocean of Internet-based

services. Moreover, electronic resources relevant to the
profession are developing at an unprecedented pace.
Academic libraries are considered to be the nerve centres
of academic institutions and supporting teaching,
research, and other academic programmes. The success
of a library in meeting the information needs of its users
play an important role. Technological advancements are
also expected to alter drastically to improve the quality of
the library services.

EARLIER STUDIES

Ojha, Dave and Sharma [1] studied the application of
information technology (IT) in Indian libraries during the
last decade of the 20th century. They attempted to
visualise Indian librarianship in the 2lst century in the light
of the ever-changing IT. The use of computers in libraries,
particularly for information management, emphasised the
ways library professionals have to change from traditional
to modern techniques. According to them, the impact of IT
in library and information science is the most in the
activities of networking, CD-ROM, Internet and
multimedia.
Vyasamoorthy [2] emphasised how college librarians
should start automation of their services in a simple way.
He explained the benefits of automation with hardware
and software details. Details of some Indian software
packages were also given.

Murthy [3] explained the benefits of automation in
academic libraries. Computerisation of the routine library
activities like acquisition, circulation, cataloguing, etc.,
followed several advantages. Most importantly, it helps in
managing resources like money, time, manpower, etc.,
properly and more efficiently cutting down the time and
improving productivity. Computerisation also improves
accuracy, speed of operation and freedom from boredom
of having to do routine clerical and monotonous work.
Librarians connotation of automation or information
technology should include all those technologies which
libraries and information centres use for collection,
processing, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of
recorded information.

numerically to 17 aided (by Government) degree colleges
of the minority community at Andhra region (8), Telangana
region (8), Rayalaseema region (1). These colleges are
affiliated to the local universities.

Minority college libraries are libraries attached to
minority institutions where graduate and postgraduate
programmes are offered in applied sciences and
humanities and differ from minority professional colleges.
These libraries should meet the educational objectives of
their respective institution. To fulfill its functions
satisfactorily the library must concentrate on providing
good services to meet the informational and educational
requirements of the users and see that staff and students
exploit the whole range of library resources. The role of
the library is very crucial to the development of the
institution, and it is literally the hub around which all
activities of study and research must concentrate. It has
been observed in general that the majority of college
libraries in India suffer from want of good resources,
infrastructure, and managerial techniques. In the
developed countries much emphasis is given to develop
the library and its resources to meet users needs. Most
of the minority colleges in the UK or the US have
automated their resources and have integrated with the
network systems in operation. This study explores the
library use patterns of students in undergraduate courses
in minority colleges in AP. Results of this study will not
only help in understanding the information needs of the
students but also will help these libraries to restructure
their resources, services and facilities to synchronise
them with the requirements of their students.

Though the units are scattered and the size of the
sample is very high a personal survey was conducted.
However, the size of the sample is limited to 19.22 per
cent, i.e., 1705 students. The criteria for selection of the
samples and the distribution of the questionnaires have
been followed as per the Stratified Simple and Systematic
Sampling method (Table 1).

METHODOLOGY

Survey method has been adopted to study the
various aspects of all the 17 (aided) degree colleges of
minority community in AP. Necessary data has been
collected through structured questionnaires, which have
been administered and collected back personally,
supported by interview schedules, and observation and
data from the registers/records of the libraries.

3.1 The Study Population
There are 58 aided and unaided minority colleges in
AP, distributed in Andhra, Telangana, and Rayalaseema
regions. The scope of the study has been confined
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

3.2 Sample
The criterion for selection of these 17 degree colleges
has been made in the chronological order, i.e., the
establishment year of the colleges. The total admission
capacity of these 17 colleges is approximately 8870
students in arts, commerce, and science streams.

3.3 Method of Data Gathering

4. ANALYSIS OF DATA AND RESULTS
The study has found a glaring difference among the
homogeneous group of these minority college libraries as
there is a lot of difference between certain libraries like St.
Francis, Maris Stella, Loyola, St. Theresa, etc. (these
libraries have been selected as colleges with potential for
excellence) against certain libraries like Anwar-Ul-Uloom,
Mumtaz College, Islamia College, etc., in overall
performance, administrative procedures, organisation of
stock, or resources, attitude, etc. To find out the
causative factors of difference and development, these
libraries with their respective officials, have to visit
personally or maintain scouting bodies to study and
record the methodology, operational procedures,
professional discipline, etc., of those good (CPE)
libraries. Therefore, the librarians required not only the
quality improving techniques, assessment skills, and
training in person, but also conduct surveys of their sister
libraries to see the difference by themselves, instead of
serious and mathematical comparisons with those
minority libraries that existed in the advanced countries.

4.1 Profile of Libraries Under Study
The minority colleges are integrated in the general
system of higher education in AP. The majority of the
colleges enjoy high reputation for their academic
excellence discipline, and character formation, and
therefore much sought after. The Christian colleges,
which offer courses in arts commerce, science, etc., are
more in number compared to the Muslim minority
colleges though Muslims in AP have established several
institutions especially for technical or engineering and
other professional courses separately.

Maris Stella College was started in 1962. Its library
was started in a small room with seating capacity for 25
persons and stocking capacity for 300 books. Library now
has its own three storied building and a collection of
65, 000 books. Table 2 presents general information
regarding 17 aided colleges in AP with their NAAC
(National Assessment and Accreditation Council)

grading. NAAC is an autonomous body established by
the University Grants Commission (UGC) of India to
assess and accredit institutions of higher education in the
country. There are six colleges exclusively for women and
only one for men (Wesley Boys College, Secunderabad)
while the rest are co-education colleges. Table 2 also
presents the total user population in respective colleges
out of which the sample population has been taken.

5. LIBRARY USE
This aspect shows the quality and quantity of the
library and also its ability of the management.

5.1 Frequency of Library Visit
Figure 1 shows that 737 (43.2 per cent) students visit
their respective libraries daily, while 467 (27.4 per cent)

than once in a week, 50 (2.9 per cent) visit once in a
fortnight, and 67 (3.9 per cent) visit their libraries once in
a month.

5.2 Satisfaction regarding Library Timings
Generally students use the library more when they
are free. So library should be open before and after college
hours. This aspect is important in the view of the users.
Figure 2 shows that 1420 (83.3 per cent) students were
satisfied with the present working hours of their respective
libraries, while 285 (16.7 per cent) were not satisfied with
the present working hours of their respective libraries. Out
of 285 students who were not satisfied with the present
library timings, 136 (47.7 per cent) felt it would be
convenient if the libraries are opened after their classes,
while 66 (23.2 percent) opted before the commencement
of classes and 83 (29.1 percent) during vacation and
holidays also.
One thousand five hundred and sixteen (88.9 per
cent) students felt that the library staff was helpful and
positive in their attitude. Only 189 (11.1 per cent) felt that
staff was not helpful in offering any assistance. The
remaining colleges were more or less drawn in criticism
regarding helpful attitude of the library staff. Since the

calculated statistic value 2.16 is greater than the table
value 1.96 of the test statistic at 5 per cent level of
significance, one can reject the Null hypothesis, i.e.,
there is a significant difference in the proportion of
satisfaction level of the students regarding convenience of
working hours.

6. LIBRARY SERVICES
Library services play an important role in the
management of the libraries. Better services can attract
more users.

6.1 Satisfaction Regarding Library Services
Seventy seven per cent of students (1321) were
satisfied with the present services against 22.5 per cent
students (384) who were not satisfied with the present
services of their libraries.

6.2 Reasons for Dissatisfaction with Library
Services
Table 3 shows the priority of reasons for
dissatisfaction vis-à-vis availability of only book lending
service was 45.1 percent (173); lack of open access 50
per cent (192); no proper arrangement of books 39.6 per

cent (152); lack of full fledged catalogue 40.9 per cent
(157); and lack of photocopying was 58.8 per cent (226).

This is the important area where each library should
concentrate. This aspect helps the libraries to develop
their sources.

6.3 Most Frequently Used Services
Table 4 shows the order of preferences regarding
services used by students vis-à-vis lending service as 60
per cent (1.34); reference service 48.4 per cent (826);
periodical and news paper services 30.5 per cent (652);
and bibliographic and indexing as 42.9 per cent (731).

7.1 Purpose of the Usage with the Library
Table 5 shows the priority-wise purpose of the usage
of the library. Students gave first priority to preparation of
notes with 62.5 per cent (1066); second to preparation of
project reports with 32.5 per cent (554); and third to
preparation for competitive exams with 35.8 per cent
(610), respectively, and the fourth to general knowledge
with 32.8 per cent (546).

The calculated value of Chi-Square (3596.4) is greater
than the critical value (table value) 16.9 at 5 per cent level
of significance at 9 degrees of freedom. Therefore, one
can reject the Null hypothesis that they are independent,
i.e., the services used by the students vary depending on
the individual libraries.

The calculated value of Chi-Square 1696.16 is greater
than the critical value (table value) 16.9 at 5 per cent level
of significance at 9 degrees of freedom. Therefore, one
can reject the Null hypothesis that is the different
purposes for which the students used the libraries varied
depending on the individual libraries.

6.4 Need for Library Orientation
This aspect is more important in library management.
This is the service provided by the library staff to the users
in order to make use of the library efficiently. Fifteen
hundred sixty-five students (91.8 per cent) felt that library
orientation is necessary to know about the library and the
services. Only 140 (8.2 per cent) students felt that library
orientation is not necessary. Majority of the students felt
that library orientation is necessary for the better use of
the library. Only few students felt that the orientation is
not necessary for proper usage of library services.

7.2 Most Used Information Sources
This aspect shows that type of sources being used
more and the area where the library can improve their
collection development. Table 6 shows the priority-wise
usage of information sources in the library. Students gave
first preference to books with 53.7 per cent (915); second

to reference books with 36.1 per cent (615); third to
magazines and journals with 35.7 per cent (609); and the
fourth to newspapers with 33.9 per cent (579). The
calculated value of Chi-Square 1276.02 is greater than the
critical value (table value) 16.9 at 5 per cent level of
significance at 9 degrees of freedom. Therefore, one can
reject the Null hypothesis. That is the different sources for
which the students used the libraries varied depending on
the individual libraries.

7.3 Sources for Finding Required Information
Library users are using different ways for finding
information according to their needs. This aspect helps
the library staff to know the needs of the users. This also
helps the library staff to develop various ways of sources
of finding information.
Table 7 shows the usage of sources for finding the
required information. The first preference 36.5 per cent
(622) was given to consultation of library catalogue;
second 31.9 per cent (545) to consulting librarian, third
24.9 per cent (425) to browsing all the document
collection at the racks; fourth 26.6 per cent (454) to interpersonal communication; and the fifth preference 32.3
per cent (550) was given to faculty members. The
calculated value of Chi-Square 1341.43 is greater than the
critical value (table value) 26.3 at 5 per cent level of
significance at 16 degrees of freedom. Therefore, one can

reject the Null hypothesis that is that the methods
followed by the students to find the required information in
the libraries vary depending on the individual libraries.

7.4 Advantages of Computerisation
Advances in IT changed the information needs very
fast. Automation of libraries is now a necessity for
effective library management. Table 8 shows the prioritywise advantages of computerisation of libraries as
perceived by the users. Quick access to data with 15.8
per cent (i.e. 271) was quoted as the first benefit; time
saving with 10.9 per cent (i.e.186) as the second, easy
browsing of data with 13.2 per cent (i.e. 225) as the third,
access to wide range of information with 10.1 per cent
(i.e. 171) as fourth, and quality of services with 7.8 per
cent (i.e.133) the fifth.

7.5 Purpose of Net Browsing
Internet has become an important source of retrieving
information from the primary sources, and helps users in
finding latest information for various purposes. Table 9
shows the priority-wise purpose of net browsing of only
those who had the facility of net surfing. First priority, 10.5
per cent (179), was given to academic purpose; second,
5.2 per cent (88), to entertainment and recreation; third,
11.4 per cent (194), to e-mail; and the fourth to gain
general knowledge 7.6 per cent (131).

8. RECOMMENDATIONS

The objectives of any library can be realised through
the satisfaction levels of its users as well as
availability of the documents. Though around 80 per
cent students were satisfied yet the remaining 20 per
cent dissatisfied cannot be ignored. The libraries of
these colleges should therefore take care of these
students.
Very few of these libraries (5 out of 17) have been
allotted a separate building exclusively for having
sufficient room for provision of stack rooms, reference
section, and periodical section, etc. Of all the
libraries, the environmental and physical conditions
at Anwar-Ul-Uloom and Mumtaz College libraries are
very poor and have neither a separate building nor
even sufficient space to accommodate the necessary
material and equipment even though they started
long back of all the colleges. Every minority college
library must be provided with a separate library
building with good ventilation, furniture (as per
ergonomics) with reading halls and stock rooms
keeping in mind the future development of the library
also.
Regarding book selection and criteria, management
should see that some efficient and scientific methods
should be adopted for allocation of grants to different
branches based on the peculiar needs of the local

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

area and requirements of a particular subject. Ample
time and scope should be given to all the concerned
teachers and the student representatives to
participate in the selection of books. It was found that
few courses like commerce and computer science
have only few books at some libraries; steps should
be taken to improve this situation.
v

The growth rate of document collection at these
colleges, especially at Andhra Muslim where 46
books were added in five years and 288 in Urdu
college, was very low. Not only document collection
but also the periodical strength at these colleges
were very low and needs to be increased, especially
at Wesley, Loyola Degree College and Islamia
College. It is recommended that these colleges try to
provide latest editions of the books, journals, and
periodicals. These libraries should also procure
competitive examination books and career guidance
books in order to fulfill the requirements of the
students.

v

Library orientation, user education are essential
activities of the non-academic professional to enable
the users to understand the system of classification,
arrangement of stock, tapping of different sources,
and resources, etc. (92 per cent among the students
felt the need for orientation). To enable the nonprofessionals to understand the importance of the

The library should establish, promote, maintain and
evaluate a range of quality services that support the
colleges mission and goals. It should provide
competent and prompt assistance to its users. Time
to visit library should be reasonable and convenient
for its users. Reference and other special assistance
should be available at times when the colleges
primary users most need them. When academic
programmes are offered at off-campus sites, library
services should be provided in accordance with the
local standards.

v

Majority of the students are demanding automated
services and Internet facility in the libraries. Proper
training should be given to the users while providing
these services, as many of the users are not much
aware of these.
Only eight libraries out of 17 were found automated.
As the NAAC makes it compulsory that all the
libraries should be automated, it is compulsory for all
the colleges to go for NAAC accreditation. Librarians
has to adhere to managerial techniques like PERT,
CPM while computerising their libraries.
The staff strength should be adequate, both
quantitatively and qualitatively. The library should
broaden the capabilities of its personnel to meet
changing needs and improve expertise through
training and continuing education. The staff should be
trained on current developments through refreshers
courses or other continuing education programmes

However, the following problems are common to
majority of the libraries: (a) complete automation of
library; (b) separate library building; (c) lack of computer
training to library staff; (d) low budget, (e) requisition of
new editions and uptodate collection in great number; (f)

lack of good number of journals; (g) provision of free
access to books; and (h) acquisition of more systems.
Therefore, the managements of these colleges should try
to provide these facilities to the libraries to cope up with
the increase information demands. These libraries should
try to implement new technologies like automation, ejournals, barcode technology, OPAC, which are essential
in the present day environment. The information mostly
used by the clients is reference and periodicals which
have to be procured by almost all the libraries. However,
the study reveals that the periodical collection is
inadequate in majority of libraries. With the outpouring of
UGC grants to those libraries that got Excellence Awards
the condition of subscription to many journal titles may
recuperate the situation.

9. CONCLUSION
This study has given a clear picture of the use of
college libraries in AP by undergraduate students. The
utilisation of college libraries in this state can be
enhanced by adopting the modern formats like audiovisual materials and electronic resources such as CD,
DVDs and the Internet. Automation of libraries according
to new technologies is very essential to cope up with the
present scenario.
