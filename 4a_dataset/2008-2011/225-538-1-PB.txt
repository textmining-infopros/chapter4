ABSTRACT
Support of the library has always been traditionally considered imperative for the completeness of education.
Even in the current electronic technology mediated e-learning, the evolving form of the library is considered
necessary. It is remarkable that the same technology means are driving both the e-learning and library
transformation process. A library professional having acquired such technological skills can therefore add
value to the e-learning process. The paper discusses the impacts of e-learning on the learner, teacher, and
library using the framework of the laws of media enunciated by Marshall McLuhan. It further discusses how
e-learning and new form of the library fit well in the emerging concept of self-service society. To spread the
modern education to the remote corners of India, a strategy of promoting the e-learning aided by the advanced
library and technology is recommended.
Keywords: E-learning, library transformation, McLuhan’s laws of media, self-service society, web intelligence

1. INTRODUCTION
In India, thousands of young students, despite
having right aptitude and necessary talent, are denied
admission to the courses and institutes of their choice
simply because of the limited physical classroom
space and other resources with the academic institutions.
It is besides the issue of quality versus quantity in
education. Again, consider the lack or absence of
suitable avenues for persons badly needing mid-career
re-skilling or taking a few specialisation courses without
compromising or dislocating their respective occupation
and responsibilities. To address such needs the concept
of distance education was introduced on a large
scale in 1960s. In India, distance education mode of
imparting education got a boost with the establishment
of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU),
New Delhi, as the central university by the Act of the
Parliament passed in 1985. Over the years it has
emerged as a role model for other universities in India
to start the distance education stream. Besides serving
the Indian students, IGNOU has now enrolled students
from more than 35 countries. It has also established
a Distance Education Council to set norms and standards
for the distance education in the country.
14

Initially, the institutes imparting distance education
used to supply the course material in the print form
and evaluate the enrolled students through periodic
written assignments and conducting examinations at
various centres. For the benefit of students some of
these institutes organise a few contact sessions with
teachers and counsellors. This learning process has
suffered mainly on account of either total absence or
slow cycle of exchange between subject specialists
and students and most importantly, the lack of adequate
library support to the students to go beyond the
supplied notes and explore the subject in further
details.
The distance education in India received a tremendous
impetus with the availability of affordable computer
and allied electronic technologies in the mid 1990s.
As a result several courses are presently conducted
using these new tools where the interaction between
the student and teacher is facilitated using electronic
means. Due to predominant use of the electronic
products, this way of imparting education is popularly
called as e-learning mode. This term is alternatively
used with many other terms like computer-based or
online learning, web-based learning, and computerDESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

supported collaborative learning. The core of the elearning process now is the electronic networking of
learners, teachers and supporting systems like library
and databases.
E-learning removes physical obstacles like space
and travel, and makes material available in variety of
forms. It facilitates interaction among students, thereby
allows them to learn from each other. It also overcomes
the problems faced particularly by the housewives
and physically challenged students as well as faculty
in participating in learning. E-learning will however
remain far from complete till it is well supported by
the modern library that provides access to digital
databases and other electronic resources, and extends
web-based services. The advances in the information
and communication technologies (ICTs) assist integration
of the e-learning and modern library because it is
driving both these developments 1. This paper briefly
reviews the evolution of learning process highlighting
the shift in the learning philosophy and change in the
roles of teacher and the library.

2. SHIFT IN THE LEARNING PROCESS
Over the years, learning has remained a face-toface activity. Still it is considered as a best practice,
at least for the school and undergraduate course
students. It is justified on the grounds that relatively
raw and young students have to learn many other
things besides the subject knowledge through physical
interaction with teachers, classmates, libraries, and
by participating in sports and social activities. However,
as the demand for courses, both of the conventional
colleges, universities and professional streams, started
increasing, the requisite basic infrastructure like
classrooms, laboratories, and libraries was found
woefully lacking. Difficulties in finding wherewithal for
such infrastructure expansion promoted the concept

CLASSROOM

of distance education where the enrolled students
need not visit a classroom. The study material and
lecture notes are supplied to them for study and to
appear for the examination as and when conducted.
With the advent of computer technology, a choice in
the form of course material in the digital medium like
floppy disk, tape and compact disk (CD) for use by
the student on a computer system at his end got
introduced. Next, with advances in the computer networking
technology and improved accessibility to the WWW
and the Internet, the option emerged to take the
courses fully online. Thus e-learning gained in popularity
for a vast section due to its certain advantages like
fast and flexible delivery, enriched material in multimedia
format, and global level participation in discussions.
As shown in the Fig. 1 (left half), physical library
has always been a mainstay of the traditional pedagogical
process when it was confined to the physical classroom
learning environment. In the new electronic technology,
also called virtual learning environment (Fig. 1 right
half), the library and information technology are sharing
that burden in a different way as learning takes place
outside the classroom. Moreover, the library itself is
undergoing transformation in its form and services,
necessitating requirement of special instructions and
skills to make proper use of the new form of the
library as well as ever evolving information technology
in the first place.It is worth mentioning that in the
expansion process, a substantial shift in the focus
of learning has taken place. Learning should be done
by action as stressed by Socrates, gave a way to
method of Plato and ultimately to logical procedure
as advocated by Aristotle2. This shows that emphasis
of learning process moved away from changing the
learner to the one of assimilating the knowledge as
shown in Fig. 2. It is however realised that learning
devoid of practice, i.e., testing it through actions, is
incomplete to a large extent.

Figure 2. Shift in the learning focus.

Like the learner, the role of the teacher has also
transformed in this process. As shown in Fig. 3,
classical blackboard-based teaching is now getting
replaced or supplemented by imparting lessons through
videoconferencing or web-based methods, corresponding
with the students using e-mail and forming a cohesive
team with students through close interaction. When
such a technology is used as a central teaching tool,
the teacher becomes a facilitator and students take
on a proactive role in learning. Often, this change of
teaching philosophy and methods leads to learnercentered teaching and constructivist teaching practices3.
A significant value-addition to the processes of imparting
knowledge and instructions is brought about by these
modern technology-driven methods that make liberal
use of high impact graphics and animation, and demonstrate
real-life applications of the concepts.
Like academic institutions, the corporate sector
has found e-learning as an attractive option to organise
training for its staff that is located across the country
or internationally in this globalisation era. Instead of
assembling the trainers and trainees at one location,
using the means like teleconferencing and web-based
seminars for conducting in-house training programmes
is found cost-effective by many companies. Even

quite a few mentoring programmes are conducted by
this method where a tele-mentor remains in close
touch with his dispersed group employing the Intranet
and e-mail facility. An exhaustive treatment of elearning along with the contemporary trends is available4.
Realising the potential of e-learning, several types
of e-learning centres are getting established. Some
of them are within the organisations to serve their
employees, while others like public access centres
are located in libraries, community centres, and academic
institutions of higher learning. This trend is picking
up in India and many private universities are offering
their courses through e-media and gaining adequate
patronage. Many companies find outsourcing their
routine training to such third-party e-education centres
more cost-effective. Further, quite a few firms engage
such centres to employ e-learning for customer education
by way of training in use of the products and services.
Managing e-learning centre to a large extent is
similar to the managing a modern library with additional
requirement of establishing close collaboration with
subject specialists. A library professional, therefore,
with suitable training and aptitude in the use of information
and communication technology (ICT), and some experience

of e-learning itself can exploit this opportunity. It may
look like as a totally new career but in essence it
can be treated as an extension of the library profession.
This is clearly seen from a review of the technology
tools that support the e-learning process as given in
the next section.

3. AN OVERVIEW OF THE E-LEARNING
TOOLS
A plethora of ICT or virtual communication tools
are now available that are employed in the e-learning
process. Most prominent among them are given below.
Some of them are asynchronous in character and
provide on-to-many type of communication facility.
They are primarily useful for information exchanging,
networking, repackaging knowledge, providing instructions,
undertaking collaborative project work, mentoring and
organising online discussions, and meetings.

Learning portal or web-based training portal.

Some of the above tools are multi-functional. For
instance, a tool like learning portal helps building a
complete virtual learning environment. Access to resources
and e-learning facilities including web-based training
materials, support, and guidance are its hallmark. In
addition, the administrative tasks like tracking the
performance of students and usage of material are
also possible.
The above listed tools, along with a few more,
form an enabling infrastructure to sustain and promote
participation in the e-learning and teaching irrespective
of the physical location of the participants and time
zone. Since face-to-face physical exchange is not
possible for such a dispersed group of learners the
support provided by such tools is vital. It usually
binds the group participating in a training or academic
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

course in the form of a ‘community of practice’. A
community of practice is formally defined as, “A special
type of informal network that emerges from a desire
to work more efficiently or to understand work more
deeply among members of a particular specialty or
work group” 5. This concept extends the traditional
networking and collaborative work to focus on the
importance to the individuals of becoming involved
with different groups, and profession’s knowledge
and practice. Memberships of such a community are
relatively low, say about 25, and formed either by
self-selection or invitation. Corporate sector encourages
its staff members to join such communities as that
proves mutually beneficial. Formation of a community
of e-learners on the above lines will help them to
learn from each other and get a wider perspective of
any issue.
A library professional is using most of the above
mentioned tools in organising modern library services
like alerting the readers about new relevant references
by e-mail, integrating information from various sources
and disseminating it to the concerned user or a group
of users by mass messaging, setting up bulletin
boards and blogs devoted to specific professional
topic or theme, and conducting web-based surveys
to assess the quality of services and usefulness of
the library material. A library professional with technical
skills can therefore readily contribute to various components
of the e-learning process.

4. EVOLUTION OF THE LIBRARY
It is appreciable that library profession has kept
pace with the evolving technology and changing information
needs of the academics, research, industry, government,
and other institutions. The transformation of the classical
library, from a mere document storage and exchanging
entity to the one providing access to its collection
and other information irrespective of the user location
besides enhancing the scope of services to cover the
electronic databases, e-journals and web-based services,
librarian’s demonstrates extended supporting role in
tune with the time. The progressive change in the
library over the past five decades and its expected
form in future is envisaged as follows 6, 7:
Brick and Mortar Library: A fixed physical premises
offering services to the users who visit physically to
the library. The services are restricted by the time
constraint. The collection is predominantly paperbased and information retrieval tools are manual and
broad.
Digital Library: Substantial amount of material in
the library is in the digital form. Users can access
it through the local or wide area network. The OPAC
17

catalogues form a basic information search tool, and
accessibility to the material is not time restricted.
e-Mobile Library: The library member, irrespective
of location and time, can completely access the
normal library services through a hand-held electronic
device like mobile phone or a personal digital assistant
(PDA). All the services are integrated and provided
through a single access authentication point like one
password.
Ubiquitous Library: The tiny technological devices
of future would be distributed throughout the human
environment, thereby enabling constant access to
the library material and services from anywhere.
In India, quite a few academic and institutional
libraries are currently in the partial digital library
stage. They provide access to the select online databases,
electronic journals, and a few web-based services to
their members. The organisations like DELNET and
INFLIBNET are providing various services to a large
number of their institutional member libraries to serve
their readers. Of course, we have to go a long way
in modernising our libraries particularly the public
libraries, which can help those learning through distance
education mode.

5. E-LEARNING AND THE LIBRARY
In recent years, the association between the elearning and library has been a topic of several studies.
For instance, a comprehensive review of e-learning
technologies, teaching and learning models and the
role and opportunities for the library and library professionals
to meaningfully contribute to e-learning has been
made by Allan 8. The taskforce of the online computer
library centre (OCLC) has also recommenced various
strategies especially for the academic libraries to
facilitate the enhancement of e-learning 9. Attempts
made by the IGNOU for continuing education programmes

for LIS through e-learning are documented too. Recent
developments by the IGNOU in the form of creating
‘eGyanKosh’, a national digital repository to store,
index, preserve, distribute, and share the digital learning
resources developed by the open and distance learning
institutions in the country and establishing an elearning platform called LIVE for library and information
science virtual education are useful 10.
It is clear that the library would continue to play
its facilitator role in the e-learning scenario. The task
now involves dealing with both print and non-print
including digital material, assisting the production of
course material, managing the copyright issues, frequent
updates of various databases, and website maintenance.
A summary of the library inputs for developing respective
component of the e-learning process is given in Table 1.
Evaluation of electronic databases and electronic
journals, selectively integrating the material from various
sources for specific courses, digital assets management
for wider access, creating learning resource catalogue
where the learning resources are organised according
to meta-tags are the examples. In sum the library is
expected to serve as learner support in the e-learning
process.
The library professional is also now expected to
promote information literacy (IL) among the users.
The set of skills needed to find, retrieve, analyse,
use, and manage information defines the term IL. It
differs significantly from the traditional reference service
where it is assumed that a user would approach the
desk with a query. The IL programme aims at user
to access and assess the library and other material
independently. It practically means the library has to
teach the following skills:

Critical thinking

To impart the above skills to the remote learners
using the technological means alone is undoubtedly
a huge challenge for the library and library profession.
It is recognised that the library itself would need
restructuring in many cases to meet the new demands
like supporting the e-learning activity and promoting
information literacy. A systematic plan employing
modern tools of operations research and management
science, which integrate viewpoints obtained through
consultations with analytical processing, can assist
this library transformation process11. This area needs
serious attention by the researchers and library managers.

6. IMPACTS OF E-LEARNING
With his far-reaching insight, Marshall McLuhan
(1911-1980) had aptly perceived the future of communication
in the wake of emerging information production and
dissemination revolution though he did not live to see
the proliferation of personal computer and the subsequent
developments. Besides introducing the idea of ‘Global
Village’, he propounded that technology, and for that
matter any man-made system brings into force four
types of impacts, namely, enhancement of features;
obsolescence of some limitations and practices; revival
of unwelcome effects; and retrieval of cherished dreams.
And importantly, all these four impacts happen
simultaneously. They are now known as McLuhan’s
four laws of media 12, 13 .
It would be interesting to explore the impacts of
e-learning in this framework. An illustration of the
impacts of e-learning according to McLuhan’s laws
is presented in Table 2. Potentials to increase the
accessibility of a training or academic course, introducing
flexibility in both teaching and learning, and providing
the study material in multimedia format are enhanced
(box I). On the obsolescence side the e-learning is
expected to remove several barriers for course admission
that are currently observed due to physical infrastructure

constraints like classroom space (box II). The dream
of obtaining the lessons from the best teacher and
participating in discussions on a global scale are
retrieved (box III). At the same time, the e-learning
process introduces several rigid digital authentication
systems to thwart threats like introduction of computer
virus, and identity theft and information manipulation
that can subvert the network operations (box IV).
At the next level, an attempt is made to analyse
various impacts of e-learning on the learner, teacher,
and library according to above stated four laws of
McLuhan. The results are presented in Table 3. The
likely positive impacts, as seen from the rows I, II
and III in Table 3 augers well for the e-learning, but
serious attention must also be paid to the row IV,
which reflects the noxiant effects. For instance, being
constantly tracked would be resented by the learner,
while a teacher would not like to be on a trail all the
time, and a library loses all its human warmth and
becomes a digital repository that works mechanically
under the instructions of say an expert system and
not a library professional who can be approached for
advice on many other matters too. Missing of the
moral dimension of commitment, which is an important
characteristic of face-to-face interactions, is also
highlighted by Dreyfus in this context 14. It is argued
that e-learning largely depends on writing mode for
exchange and many students are not comfortable
with that mode of learning. Moreover, the subjects
that need hands-on tutoring may not be properly
covered by the e-learning process. It is expected that
further advances in the e-learning tools would address
these issues 15.
Exercise in the above format can help assessing
the impact of any specific e-learning course or technology
tool. Designing a suitable strategy to make the best
use of the e-learning while avoiding or minimising the
ill effects can thus be achieved.

7. TOWARDS SELF-SERVICE SOCIETY
On a broader sense the e-learning process and
the library promoting IL as discussed above are in
conformity with another social change, namely,
transformation of a society into a self-service society.
In the western developed countries due to factors like

declining and aging population and mounting cost of
person-based services a trend toward self-help for
many services started a few decades back. Selfservice department stores or malls, ATM banking,
self-diagnosing machines, and many similar devices
and services were designed to promote this concept.
Rapid advances in the electronic technology and
user-friendly devices are now driving this trend. Even
in the field of medicine and healthcare the economic
analysis shows the marked benefits of self-service
practice on a significant scale 16.
Traditionally, both education system and library
system, involved two distinct components, namely,
a physical service provider, and consumer interacting
at a fixed location and time. Till the advent of the
modern information technology there was no viable
alternative available for that model. However, e-learning
supported by digital library has eliminated the constraints
of physical space and time for imparting modern
education and training, particularly at higher levels.
Here too the economics is in favour of e-learning.
With this benefit in view, India launched an exclusive
satellite EDUSAT, in September 2004. The EDUSAT
networking is being implemented through various
agencies to ultimately reach all the districts in the
country. Presently, for instance, daily conduct of
sessions on technical topics via the EDUSAT is greatly
facilitating the students and faculty of 120 engineering
colleges affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University
of Karnataka. Likewise the students of Yashwantrao
Chavan Maharashtra Open University and Rajiv Gandhi
Technical University, Madhya Pradesh, are getting
the benefits of such services. More than 2,500 schools
in the backward districts of the country lacking adequate
teachers and other facilities are already covered by
EDUSAT operations and thereby providing those students
20

an opportunity to get modern education. Wider usefulness
of this system can be understood by the fact that
10 schools for blind in Gujarat are served by the
special transmission organised via EDUSAT 17 . This
distant mode of teaching and learning may not strictly
fall under the concept of e-learning, but it prepares
the ground for continuing education through e-learning
stream in future.
On the higher end of the spectrum, the development
of the concept of web intelligence, which incorporates
practical utilities of artificial intelligence and advanced
information technology in the next generation of webrelated products, systems, services, and activities,
is expected to contribute significantly to self-learning.
Some of its products like intelligent web services,
semantic markup, and web mining are expected to
boost the e-learning in a significant way as discussed
below 18. For example a proposed expert system called
Educational Servers would have enough capability to
arrange for personalisation of the learning tasks to
act as an intelligent tutor with both domain and pedagogical
knowledge. It would also keep track of the learning
progress of individual student and deliver the course
accordingly. The advanced technique of web mining,
which collects globally distributed content and knowledge
from the web, refreshes and structures it continuously,
and tracks its usage would greatly assist this process.
Development of web community of human learners
who can further act as pedagogical agents can lead
to the elevation of whole self-learning process to new
heights 19. The library professional can handle most
of the web intelligence-based e-learning management
activities.
The field of education can easily adopt the concept
of self-service for imparting both education and training.
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(1)

The e-learning strengthened with adequate library
facility emerges as most attractive option in this
regard. The education planners in India should suitably
design it for implementation at various levels and
ensure its smooth implementation across the country.

e-learning does not seem possible without such advanced
library back-up. The library should therefore clearly
define its goals and guiding principles for participating
in the distance education programmes of its parent
body.

8. CONCLUSION

In particular, a virtual reference service by libraries
to assist the remotely located students or faculty in
identifying pertinent resources, accessing relevant
databases and providing suitably packaged supplementary
course material would go a long way in strengthening
and value adding to the e-learning process. Fortunately
the technological tools driving the e-learning process
are the same that are used in the modern library
operations. The library professional should work on
this advantage further to play an active part in the
conduct of e-learning at different levels. Lucrative
career prospects are thus expected for a library professional
in this area like that of online learning designer and
knowledge packager. By participating in the e-learning
process a librarian would be serving the cause of
education, training, research, and scholarship in the
new society too.

Education and training, which was traditionally
bound to the classrooms, cannot be expanded beyond
a point. Moreover, it depended on exchanges using
spoken words. The efficiency of that interaction mode
suffers on many accounts like availability of physical
space; time-bound delivery, and attentiveness of the
recipients. The fast growing e-learning method overcomes
many of these limitations. For example, the material
exchanged through computer and communications
technologies remains available for prolonged discussion
and facilitate one-to-one or even many-to-many interactions
for any desired length of time. The feature of asynchronous
communication underlying e-learning helps one to
learn and react at one’s own pace and time. Besides
employing the e-learning process to share the quality
teaching and other scarce resources, it can be innovatively
used for several other purposes. For instance, it can
be adopted for training the agriculture extension workers,
semi-health professionals, and even in the much required
correction process for the jail inmates.
Designing suitable action programmes to advance
e-learning as a self-service or self-help measure should
receive attention. Addressing the issue of digital divide
by investing in necessary computer and networking
technology, minimising the implementation time and
providing training to use the technology tools is therefore
necessary. Like the digital divide, English language
fluency divide is to be tackled because most of the
current computer technology and course contents
require command over English. Development of multilingual
contents and tutorial like courses would be helpful
in that direction. Integration of several e-learning tools
is another emerging need. Promoting e-learning to
fight skill obsolescence would certainly help persons
in all the fields to remain relevant in the fast changing
job market, and to meet the professional demands.The
impacts of e-learning would happen in variety of ways.
It is necessary to filter out the harmful ones and
initiate actions that promote the beneficial ones. Periodic
studies about assessing the impacts on different
stakeholders in the framework of McLuhan’s laws of
media are therefore recommended.The library has
always played a very important role in supporting
education for both masses and classes. Its transformation
to provide digital document-based services, to establish
institutional repository of knowledge, and to act as
a facilitator for inculcating information literacy should
get a due priority. Realisation of the full potential of
