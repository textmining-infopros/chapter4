1. INTRODUCTION
Web 2.0 tools and technologies like Blogs, Flickr,
Facebook, Myspace, Orkut, Linkedln, Twiter, Hi5,
Friendster, and Nig help in communication and sharing
of information. These tools are open to all. Some of
these tools are intended to a particular group of people
such as CafeMom (opens to moms and to be moms)
and Pinksta (opens to internet experts). Facebook,
Myspace, Nig and Friendster are similar networking
sites designed to connect users. Facebook acts as an
online interface to reach out to the users where they
are. Twitter enables its users to send and read
messages. Library uses twitter to convey short
messages regarding its resources and services. Flickr
is an image and video hosting website, web services
suite, and online community. Among these various Web
2.0 tools and technologies, weblog or blog is an
important
tool
for
information
sharing
and
communication. It provides value-added services to
library and information centres. The usefulness and
popularity of blogs is increasing because of its
adoptability, low cost, flexibility, and applicability. This
technology may become a medium of choice for
libraries.

content of the main page. Therefore, blog is one of the
most important and interesting tools for sharing
information and communication on the Web. The term
“Weblog” was coined by Jorn Berger on 17 December
1997. The short form “Blog” was coined by Peter
Merholz, who jokingly broke the word into the fresh
“weblog” in his blog in 19991. Evan Williams, one of the
creators of the popular blogging tool Blogger, describes
it as “the blog concept is about three things: Frequency,
Brevity, and Personality.
Blog is an online diary where one can post
information (not only text but also audio, photographs
and videos) on a regular basis. There are some related
terms in creating blogs like blogger, blogging, blogging
software, blogrolling, blogosphere, etc. Blogger is a
person who can create, maintain, and edit or write
entries to a blog. Blogging is the act of creating,
authorising, maintaining or adding an article to a blog.
Blogging software (Blogger, Word Press) makes it
easier for people to create blogs. Blogrolling is the act
of moving from one blog to another and blogosphere is
the world or community of blogs and blogging.
