ABSTRACT
Defence Science Journal has a prominent place in the dissemination of Defence Research & Development
information all over the world. Bibliometric analysis of papers published in the Defence Science Journal during
the years 1997 to 2006 has been presented in this paper. Attempt has been made to study the 10 volumes
of this journal on the basis of different parameters, viz., year-wise distribution of the papers, authorship
pattern, average number of references per paper in the journal, average length of the papers, institute-wise
distribution of papers, major contributors, subject-wise distribution of the papers, and country-wise distribution
of papers.
Keywords: Defence Science Journal, bibliometric analysis, study, defence, Defence Research and Development
Organisation

INTRODUCTION

Defence Science Journal (DSJ), a quarterly (now
bimonthly) publication of the Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO), Ministry of Defence,
Government of India, is published by the Defence
Scientific Information and Documentation Centre
(DESIDOC), Delhi since 1949. It is published in the
months of January, March, May, July, September and
November. DSJ publishes the research papers in various
disciplines of science and technology, which by and large
lead to tangible results for direct defence applications. It
covers the
research, review
papers,
short
communications, and scientific correspondence. The
major subject fields covered in DSJ include: applied
physics, chemical technology, material science,
biomedical sciences, computer sciences, engineering,
electronics, and aeronautics, etc.

EARLIER STUDIES

Several studies have been done earlier by different
authors regarding the bibliometric study/analysis, citation
analysis, etc. of papers of different journals of various
fields. Das [1]; Dhiman [2]; Hazarika, Goswami and Das
[3]; Sivasubramanian [4,5]; Tiew [6]; Dutta and Sen [7, 8];
Thaty and Mishra [9]; Kannappanavar, Swamy and
Kumar [10]; Bandyopadhyay [11]; Kumar and Kumar [12];
Joshi and Maheswarappa [13]; and Gupta [14] have
studied the contributions of different journals related to
Physics, Botany, Agriculture, Mathematics, etc. As far as
journals of library science are concerned, few studies

related to analysis of contributions to ILA Bulletin [15];
Library Herald [16]; IASLIC Bulletin [17] and Annals of
Library and Information Studies [18] have been done by
Neerja Verma. Vij and Bedi [19] have studied ten years
bibliometric study of DSJ previously. The present study is
the next link to that study.

percentage, i.e., 149 (28.43 per cent). The number of
three-authored papers is 131 (25 per cent), and singleauthored papers are 113 (21.56 per cent). The maximum
number of authors i.e., eight is found in only one paper
(0.19 per cent). Table also shows year-wise authorship
pattern of contributions.

5.3 Study of References

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For the purpose of this study, DSJ has been selected
as the source journal. Recently it has completed 59
volumes. In the present paper, the 42 issues along with
two additional issues of the 10 volumes, i.e., Vol. 47-56
(1997-2006) of this journal have been selected for the
study. All the papers from 10 volumes have been scanned
to analyse their subjects, authors, geographical
distribution, numbers of references, and number of pages.

5.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The total number of papers in the 10 years (19972006) is 524, which comprises of research and review
papers as well as short communications. Letters to the
editor have been excluded from this study.

5.1 Year-wise Distribution
Table 1 shows the details of the number of papers
from 1997-2006. Table shows that maximum number of
papers were published in the year 2006, i.e., 84 (16.03 per
cent) out of the total number of papers, i.e., 524. The
minimum numbers of papers (41; 7.82 per cent) were
published in the year 2003.

5.2 Authorship Pattern of Papers
Table 2 shows the authorship pattern of the papers
published. Two-authored papers comprised the highest

Table 3 gives details of the number of references
appeared at the end of papers. Out of the total 524 papers
published, 18 (3.43 per cent) papers have no references.
The highest number of papers, i.e., 265 (50.57 per cent)
have 1-10 references per paper. Next to it comes 142
(27.09 per cent) papers having 11-20 references per paper.
Five papers (0.95 per cent) have references more than
101. Only two papers (0.38 per cent) have 81-90
references per paper, and two (0.38 per cent) 91-100
references per paper. Table 3 also shows number of
references per paper year-wise.

5.4 Length of Papers
Table 4 reveals the length of the papers. Out of 524
papers, 330 papers (62.97 per cent) covered 6-10 pages
while 106 papers (20.22 per cent) covered 11-15 pages.
There is only one (0.19 per cent) paper that has 41-45
pages. Table 4 also shows length of papers year-wise.

5.5 Institution-wise Distribution
Table 5 indicates the papers contributed by various
institutes/laboratories. The maximum papers, i.e., 47
(8.96 per cent) are from High Energy Materials Research
Laboratory (HEMRL), Pune. Next contribution is from
Defence Research and Development Establishment,

CONCLUSIONS

The following conclusions are drawn from the present
study:

6. Tiew, Wia Sin S. J. Natural Rubber Research 19981996: A ten year bibliometric study. IASLIC Bulletin,
1998, 43(2), 49-57.

Ë

The maximum numbers of papers (84) were
published in 2006, and minimum 41 in 2003.

7. Dutta, Bidyarthi & Sen, B.K. Indian J Pure and
Applied Physics: An analysis of citation pattern. ILA
Bulletin, 2000, 36(3), 65-68.

Ë

Authorship pattern shows that most of the
contributors prefer to contribute their work with one
companion.

8. Duttta, Bidyarthi & Sen, B.K. Indian J Pure and
Applied Mathematics: An analysis of citation pattern.
IASLIC Bulletin, 2001, 46(4), 221-26.

Ë

Most of the papers (265) have 1-10 references. This
is a healthy trend. Eighteen papers were without
references.

9. Thate Rajendra, Kumar & Mishra, Sanjay. Periodicals
cited most frequently by Indian agricultural
economists. ILA Bulletin, 1990, 26(1), 45-50.

Ë

The average length of papers ranged between 6-10
pages, which constitute 330 papers of the total. This
is the ideal length for research papers.

Ë

High Energy Materials Research Laboratory
contributed maximum (47) papers followed by the
Defence Research and Development Establishment
with 28 papers.

Ë

S.N. Dixit contributed maximum papers in DSJ
during the period under study.

Ë

Authors from 16 foreign countries contributed in this
Indian journal as found in the study of 10 volumes. It
reflects that the journal needs the popularity in other
countries also.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The authors thank Dr D.C. Gupta, Head TIRC and
Joint Director Defence Research and Development
Establishment (DRDE), Gwalior, for giving permission to
publish this study and his valuable suggestions during the
study.
