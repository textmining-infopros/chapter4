ABSTRACT
This paper attempts to highlight quantitatively the growth and development of Indian research in the field
of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in terms of publication output as per Science Citation Index (1982-2008).
The whole database contains 296072 records on the subject and among them USA topped the list with 84561
(28.56 per cent) followed by, China with 43393 (14.66 per cent) publications, Japan with 32431 (10.95 per
cent) publications, Germany with 28065 (9.48 per cent) publications, France with 18141 (6.13 per cent)
publications, and England with 13850 (4.68 per cent) publications. During 1982-2008, a total of 8326 (2.81
per cent) papers were published by the Indian scientists in the field. The yearly average number of documents
published was 308.37. The highest numbers of publications (1890) were published in 2008. The premier Indian
institutes engaged in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology research were: Indian Institute of Science (IISc),
Bangaluru with 723 publications followed by IIT Kharagpur with 606 publications; National Chemical Laboratories
(NCL), Pune with 589 publications; Indian Association for the Cultivation of science (IACS), Kolkata with 563

1. INTRODUCTION
The term Nanotechnology is nowadays well known
not only in all relevant scientific and technical areas, but
also to a considerable extent in the public domain, based
on reports in newspapers, on television and, whether
justified or not, in a series of commercially available
products with “nano” as part of their names. On one hand,
this development could be considered in a positive sense,
indicating nanotechnology as an accepted new
technology. On the other hand, it contains some risks
that should not be neglected. This is due to the rather
complex definition of nanotechnology and nanoscience
as a sectional science, involving natural and materials
Received on 19 November 2009

sciences, engineering, and medicine1. Numerous
definitions of nanotechnology exist in the literature. Most
of these simply say that nanotechnology considers
materials and architectures on the nanoscale. In some
definitions it is stated that nanotechnology deals mainly
with structures in the region between 1 nm and 100 nm. In
any case, the dimension plays the dominant role. For a
more detailed description, however, this is much too
simple. First, nanotechnology follows nanoscience,
where fundamental effects have been discovered before.
In a long course of development, a technology may result
from scientific findings in some cases, but not in all cases
by a long way. So, to understand nanotechnology, one
has to define properly what nanoscience is. Among the

numerous attempts to define nanotechnology and
nanoscience the definition formulated by a team of
scientists at the Europaische Akademie zur Erforschung
wissenschaftlich-technischer
Entwicklungen
Bad
Neuenahr-Ahrweiler mbH, seems to be most appropriate:
“Nanotechnology comprises the emerging application of
Nanoscience. Nanoscience deals with functional
systems either based on the use of subunits with specific
size-dependent properties or of individual or combined
functionalized subunits”2. This nanotechnology refers
broadly to a field of applied science and technology
whose unifying theme is the control of matter on the
atomic and molecular scale, normally 1 to 100 nm, and
the fabrication of devices with critical dimensions that lie
within that size range3.

Braun, et al. 9 have studied the main growth and trends
of this exciting new science and technology fields by
measuring the growth rate of the nano-prefixed terms in
the title of journal papers appeared in SCI. It has been
shown that the investigations dealing with graphite
nanotubes represent kinetically the most active field of
research in the nanosciences. One way of monitoring the
emergence of new fields is to peruse the papers and
reviews published on the topic. There are many similar
studies carried out in the field10-17. Considering the
importance of this field it was decided to assess the
Indian contribution to the literature accumulated on the
subject and analyse the published papers where at least
one author is affiliated to Indian institutes.

2. OBJECTIVES
Nanoscience explores the possibility of creating new
structures and compounds atom by atom. Technologies
exist for creating nanometer-sized devices and
structures; many fabricated by the same capabilities that
fuel the silicon integrated circuit industry. For example, it
is possible to create single atom thick tubes of carbon
(carbon nanotubes) that have many fascinating structural
and electrical properties. It is also possible to engineer
nanometer-sized machines that can interact with
individual cells. As of yet, the application of many of these
structures has yet to be explored.
Nanotechnology by its nature is interdisciplinary, and
chemists, physicists, biologists, and engineers all have
roles to play in its development and implementation.
Several strength areas in nanotechnology have broadly
been identified. The first of these is nanostructured
materials, which includes both new composite materials
as well as electronic and optical materials. Biomimetics
is developing biologically inspired technologies, and
ranges from materials that work as an artificial eyelid to
neural inspired computing models. The nano-bio interface
focuses on developing nanotechnologies that are
interactive with the biological world for sensing, gene
identification, or drug delivery applications4.
Nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) is a young
scientific and technological field that has generated
voluminous information and data in the past two
decades5-6. Kostoff, et al.7 analysed the nanotechnology/
nanoscience research literature using Science Citation
Index/Social Science Citation Index (SCI/SSCI)
databases. The analysed parameters include: technical
structure (taxonomy); prolific authors, key journals/
institutions/countries, most cited authors/journals/
documents; technical thrust areas; and characteristics of
400 most cited nanotechnology papers.
Lin and Zhang8 have studied the language trends in
nanoscience and nanotechnology publications with
emphasis on Chinese language publications.

The main objective of the study is to present the
growth of Indian literature on nanoscience and
nanotechnology and make the quantitative assessment of
the research in terms of geographical distribution of
research
output,
year-wise
research
output,
characteristics of highly productive institutions nature of
collaboration, most productive authors, the channels of
communications used by the scientists, and the high
frequency keywords appeared in the Key-Words-Plus and
Author-Keywords fields in SCI.

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Science Citation Index, published by a division of the
Thomson Corporation Inc. (formerly Institute for Scientific
Information, Philadelphia), is one of the comprehensive
databases covering all aspects of science. Data was
collected from the CD-ROM version of SCI for the 19822008 (27 years) period. Glanzel18, et al. used the following
comprehensive search strings used by Wilson19, et al. to
elicit
records
relevant
to
nanoscience
and
nanotechnology from SCI database.

The same query was applied in the ‘TITLE and
KEYWORDS’ fields of SCI to extract data for the present
study. The search was again narrowed down by
combining the string with ‘INDIA’ in ADDRESS field to
elicit records with at least one author from India involved in
the publication. A total of 8326 records were retrieved and
these records were analysed using the spreadsheet
application as per the objectives of the study. Similarly
data for other countries were retrieved by replacing names
of countries in the search string in address field.

4.2 Activity Index of Selected Countries
The activity index (AI) characterises the relative
research efforts of a country in a given field of research.
Karki, et al.20 have studied activity and growth of Organic
Chemistry in India. This indicator helps us to know which
country was active during which period. AI of 15 selected
countries is given in Table 1. USA had the highest AI, 1.80
during 1982-84, China 1.35 during 2006-2008, Japan 1.83
during 1988-1990, Germany 1.37 during 1997-1999,
France 1.25 during 1997-1999, England 2.17 during 19851987, Russia 1.46 during 1997-1999 and India 1.39 during
2006-2008.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Publications growth in Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology in Selected Countries

4.3 Growth of Indian Publications
An exponential growth in the number of publications
on nanoscience and nanotechnology was observed during
1982-2008. The highest growth was found during 20062008 with 4786 publications followed by 2028 publications
during 2003-2005, and 867 publications during 2000-2002.
Table 2 gives the growth rate of publications in
nanoscience and nanotechnology research in different
three year blocks. The average number of publications
produced per year was 308.37 and the highest numbers of
publications, 1890, were produced in 2008.

The publication productivity of 15 selected countries
is given in Figure 1. A total of 296072 publications were
published globally during 1982-2008 out of which more
than 271314 (91.64 per cent) publications were from only
15 countries. Among these countries, the USA topped the
list with 84561 (28.56 per cent) followed by China with
43393 (14.66 per cent), Japan with 32431 (10.95 per
cent), Germany with 28065 (9.48 per cent), France with
18141 (6.13 per cent), England with 13850 (4.68 per
cent), Russia with 10135 (3.42 per cent), India with 8326
(2.81 per cent), Canada with 7212 (2.44 per cent), Spain
with 7109 (2.40 per cent), Netherlands with 4690 (1.58
per cent), Australia, with 4429 (1.50 per cent), Brazil with
3215 (1.09 per cent) Switzerland with 3115 (1.05 per
cent), and Israel with 2642 (0.89 per cent) publications.

Figure 2 gives year-wise growth of publications in
nanoscience and nanotechnology research. It can be
clearly visualised from Fig. 2 that growth of the literature
was very low during 1982-1999 and it grew very fast during
2000-2008. This indicates that research in nanoscience

constituted 30.48 per cent of total articles. There were
four papers with 225 authors each and two papers with
255 authors each, respectively.

Figure 3 depicts the time-trend of single-authored and
collaborative nanoscience and nanotechnology research
publications as per Science Citation Index (1982-2008). In
both the cases, an upward trend was observed. In recent
five years of the study, the numbers of multi-authored
publications were more than the single-authored
publications indicating the highly multidisciplinary nature
of the field which requires collaboration from various
disciplines, and National and International laboratories.

4.6 Most Prolific Authors
The 8326 publications under study were the result of
collective efforts of 10701 individual authors having 33704
authorships. Table 5 provides the list of most prolific
authors (those who have contributed at least 25 papers) in
the nanoscience and nanotechnology research during the
period under study. The total contribution of these 86
authors contributed almost 46.87 percent of the total
number of articles published. The first publication year
and last publication year of the individual authors was also
analysed to find out the active period of researchers in the
field. The most prolific authors were: C.N.R Rao with 198
publications; M. Sastry with 177 publications; S.

4.7 Inter-Institution, City and State
Collaboration
The study has analysed the collaboration of
affiliations of authors who wrote the nanoscience and
nanotechnology articles. Table 6 gives the list of interinstitution collaboration. Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore had 134 collaborative papers with Jawaharlal
Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research,
Bangalore followed by NCL, Pune had 54 collaborative
papers with University of Poona, Pune, IIT Bombay,
Mumbai had 25 collaborative papers with TIFR, Mumbai. A
close watch on the table reveals that maximum institutes
had collaboration with the institutes in the same city. The
collaboration of the major cities in India was analysed and
the maximum number of collaboration was found with the
institutes in Bangalore and with the institutes in Kolkata.
The other part of the results is presented in Table 7.
Collaboration among the institutes spread across Indian
states in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology
was also analysed and it is presented in Table 8.
Collaboration was maximum among the institutes of
Karnataka and West Bengal states.

4.8 International Collaboration
In recent years, every country has realised the
importance of collaborative research to tackle many
scientific problems resulting in many international

collaborations. There were 2566 internationally
collaborated papers with 67 countries. Table 9 provides
international collaboration pattern of Indian institutes in
Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. Indian institutes had
the highest number of collaborative papers with countries
like the United States, Germany, Japan, South Korea,
France and England. The institutes from other countries
who collaborated with Indian institutes in the field of
nanoscience and nanotechnology were analysed and
found that there were 1045 foregin institutes as per
Science Citation Index (1982-2008). The most occurred
15 institutes are listed in Table 10.

4.9 Highly Preferred Journals and Article
Types
Table 11 Provides a list of journals which published at
least 51 Indian articles in nanoscience and technology.
The articles are distributed over 612 journals. The most
preferred five journals were: Journal of Applied Physics
(293); Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (285);
Applied Physics Letters (243); Materials Letters (232);
Physical Review B (232); Nanotechnology (194); Langmuir
(182); Journal of Physical Chemistry B (167). These
journals have fairly good impact factors (IF) and
immediacy index (II). The journal publications under study
were categorised into eight categories of document types
and the distribution of publications is given in Table 12.

4.11 Distribution of Keywords
Keywords are one of the best scientometric indicators
to understand and grasp instantaneously the thought
content of the papers and to find out the growth of the
subject field. By analysing the keywords appeared either
in the title or assigned by the indexer or the author himself
help in knowing in which direction the knowledge grows.
The high frequency keywords in a micro-field will enable
us to understand the direction of research in the microfield. The present study has identified the keywords
appeared in the Key-Words-Plus and Author Keywords
fields of SCI. There were a total of 19718 individual
keywords occurred. Table 14 lists the frequently occurred

5. CONCLUSION
A total of 296072 publications were published globally
in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology during
1982-2008. USA topped the list with 84561 (28.56 per
cent) followed by, China with 43393 (14.66 per cent)
publications, Japan with 32431 (10.95 per cent)
publications, Germany with 28065 (9.48 per cent)
publications, France with 18141 (6.13 per cent)
publications, and England with 13850 (4.68 per cent)
publications. India contributed to the field with 8326 (2.81
per cent) publications during 1982-2008.The study reveals
that Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore contributed the
highest number of publications (723) followed by IndianInstitute of Technology, Kharagpur with 606 publications,
National Chemical Laboratory, Pune with 589
publications, Indian Association for Cultivation Science,
Kolkata with 563 publications and Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre, Mumbai with 434 publications.
The steep growth in number of publications from India
on nanoscience and nanotechnology during 2000-2008
shows the magnitude and sustained impetus received for
the field. The recent science research fields are
witnessing high collaboration of authors in local, national
and international levels. In the present study, 96.83 per
cent of the total publications were collaborative in nature
and among the collaborated papers, 48.79 per cent had
three authored papers. The percentage share of
collaborative publications with two authors and four
authors had almost same number of publications (21.87
per cent and 20.73 per cent respectively) and megaauthorships publications (publications with > 5 authors)
constituted 30.48 per cent. C.N.R. Rao, M. Sastry, S.
Chaudhuri, D. Chakravorty, A. Govindaraj, T. Pradeep, K.
Vijayamohanan, T. Pal, D.K. Avasthi, A.K. Bhowmick, R.
Pasricha and P. Pramanik were the most productive
authors in the field.
The study reveals that IISc, Banglore, IIT Kharagpur,
NCL, Pune, IACS, Kolkatta and BARC Mumbai are the
top five institutes in India, where extensive level of
research on nanoscience and nanotechnology is going on
and these institutes have collaborated papers with
institutes from USA, Germany and Japan. Acad-Sinica,
Inst Phys, Taipei, Taiwan; Hahn-Meitner-Inst-BerlinGmbh, Berlin, Germany; Chonbuk-Natl-Univ, Dept-TextEngn, Chonju, South-Korea; Austrian-Acad-Sci, InstBiophys-Xray-Struct-Res, Austria; Sincrotrone-Trieste,
Italy were the most collaborated foreign institutes with
Indian Institutes. A noteworthy number of collaborative
publications (134) were from Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore and Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced
DESIDOC Jl. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2010, 30(2)

Scientific Research, Bangalore. Bangalore city was found
to be the centre of activity in nanoscience and
nanotechnology research. The institutes located in
Bangalore and Kolkata had the highest collaborative
publications (71).
More than 95.38 percent of the articles were published
in journals with high impact factors which is suggestive of
the publications behaviour of scientists who preferred to
publish their papers in highly reputed journals like Journal
of Applied Physics, Journal of Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology, Applied Physics Letters, Materials
Letters, Physical Review B, Nanotechnology, Langmuir,
Journal of Physical Chemistry B, Journal of Physical
Chemistry C, and Journal of Applied Polymer Science.It
will be quite interesting if one attempts to carryout citation
analysis of these papers which may give interesting
insights into the dynamics of this field.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Director, Chemistry Group, Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre, Mumbai, for going through the manuscript and
making valuable suggestions to improve the paper.
