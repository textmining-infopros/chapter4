ABSTRACT
HELLIS network is a global network functioning through its ‘network of networks’ at various levels, viz.,
intra-national, international, intra-regional, and inter-regional. Philosophically and functionally, the HELLIS network
is flexible and integrated to academic, research and publication process including healthcare delivery system
in respective member countries of the network. The HELLIS network is both a social and technological network,
linked horizontally and vertically at various levels, viz., national, regional and global, where sharing process
is made practical, viable, and affordable. The HELLIS network is more of a culture than just a consortium of
purchasing commercial resources thereby it has created an environment to share resource, responsibilities,
expertise, and service including the consolidation of information assets in their respective country. In recent
practices, consortia are perceived just as a purchase club and a technology based resources networking
not a library network.

INTRODUCTION

Health Literature, Library and Information Services
(HELLIS) is a well-planned network. Over the years it has
evolved more as social network of libraries, not just a
network of e-resources or a technology-based network.
(HELLIS network is referred as “the network” and the
Region referred to “WHO regional countries” in this
article). The primary responsibility of the network is to
fulfill the maximum needs of the users in the region by
sharing resources and services among health science
libraries at national, regional and global level. The practice
of sharing resources among libraries is not new, it has
been developed as a part of librarianship culture. Majority
of the libraries, in India, are practicing resource sharing as
an informal activity among libraries, more as a library
relationship, than a policy/professional binding. After the
active application of information technology and maturity
of the Internet, technology-based consortia are increasing
where technology is used as supplementing strength to
share resources. Majority of these technology-based
consortia are having short-term agreement for better
bargain, improved buying power, usually acquire specific
12

range of resources addressing specific users. Most of
these consortia, in India, are triggered and driven by
publishers, aggregators, technology solution providers
and value-added commercial service providers, and are
confined to share e-journals and/or bibliographic
databases.
The development of technology-based consortia, over
the years, witnessed various types and classified (as per
many studies) as open consortia, closed group consortia,
centrally funded model, shared-budget model, publisher
initiatives, national consortium and international
consortium. The benefits derived from these consortia are
like sharing knowledge, resource, expertise, skills, and
best practices among member libraries. These networks
or consortia perceive that it has created an opportunity to
foster cooperation and collaboration to build lobbying
power, negotiation capability, purchasing power and
potentiality to leverage investment. Majority of the
consortia members think that technology skill is most
important for consortia management or resources sharing
management like system configuration, operations
training, collection and publication of library statistics for

benchmarking library assessment, measurement and
data analysis without considering as team spirit or a
culture in developing resource sharing environment.

HELLIS NETWORK—AN OVERVIEW

HELLIS network was initiated prior to information
technology (IT) application and Internet era, when libraries
were predominantly traditional, handling printed media
and manual information processing. The structure of the
HELLIS network is a like ‘network of networks’, where
each country has developed their network within the
country to participate with the HELLIS.
Each participating countries recognises a welldeveloped library or a designated National Medical Library
as the National Focal Point (NFP), which is networked
horizontally and vertically through referral centres and
resource centres within the country. Large libraries,
having good information resources and qualified staff, are
recognised as the resources centres. Of course to cover
the service to all the health care team and public,
irrespective of the users/public attached to institutions or
not, it requires to extend the service through recognised
“service extension centers” as a part of the network, as
near as possible to grass root level. In some of the
regions, coordination of the network was rotated among
the libraries/information centers, considering national
contact/focal point as the channel of communication for
regional network. There are national network committee
comprises NFP as fixed and the secretary is rotated
among the participating libraries/information centers. The
network has over 350 member libraries in 11 membercountries namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, DPR Korea, India,
Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, and Timor-Leste [1-3].
In HELLIS network, each nation is expected to
develop their framework and functional approach for
participation. The common goals of all regional and
national networks are to identify, collect, organise,
process, share, and disseminate national/international
knowledge assets. The network aimed to ensure the easy
access to maximum information at different level of
network of libraries—libraries within the country, with
other countries of the region and with other region. All
participating members of the networks are treated as
equal partners and all countries in the regional network
are also treated as equal partners.
The HELLIS started as traditional model (network of
libraries) for resources sharing and cooperative
acquisitions, developed progressively in consonance with
technological development and conformity with
international standards. The network is supported by its
well-developed and periodically reviewed guiding
principles. The participation of the member libraries is not
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

just to utilise the resources and services; they have to
contribute in consolidating the national assets of the
member countries. National level network are to take
responsibility in promoting cooperation among libraries
and/or various specialty subject areas by involving
national institutes as referral libraries in extending optimal
use of existing resource and services. The national level
coordination has to be developed by working suitable
framework through their respective national authorities
depending on political, economic, cultural and other local
consideration with consensus of all the participant
libraries. The information service from the network is not
just confined to academicians; researchers and
practitioners affiliated to institutions but also to health
planners, administrators, and private practitioner and
general public. All participating libraries are to be assisted
by WHO in developing minimum capability for effective
participation.

3. ACTIVITIES OF HELLIS
HELLIS network has holistic approach in building a
sharing culture and environment in its activities covering
both social and technological network of libraries. The
primary goals envisaged, by the HELLIS networks, are to:
(a) Provide easy access to maximum information in the
field of health and biomedical sciences.
(b) Discover and consolidate information resources in
their respective member countries and create a
database (example IMSEAR–Index Medicus for
South-East Asian Region).
(c) Manage and share information resources.
(d) Strengthen libraries by
capabilities and capacities.

enhancing

technical

(e) Exchange of duplicate issues of journals among all
the member countries.
The activities proposed in the network are - periodical
training to library personnel, cooperation in acquisition of
information resources and equipments, preparation and
consolidation of union catalogue of journals and serials,
providing access to bibliographic database (MEDLARS),
developing bibliographic database of the region
(IMSEAR), photocopy services among libraries of the
network and non-members, conducting periodical
workshop/meetings of librarians, preparation and
distribution of newsletters to all participant libraries and
non-participating health libraries, organising users
education, compilation of directories of experts, expertise
and special equipments available at various level of
institution, developing computer unit for training and
research, cooperation in developing standards and
sharing best practices [4, 5].

INSTITUTIONALISATION OF HELLIS
NETWORK

WHO’s constitution Article 2, paragraphs (q) and (r)
specifically entrust the organisation with the task of
providing information and to assist in developing an
informed public opinion among all people on matters of
health. The mandate includes the supply of medical
textbooks and literature, revolving fund for the purchase of
books and journals, and the establishment of depository
libraries [6]. Librarians, heads of research institutions and
administrators from the member countries of the region, in
their first meeting, held at New Delhi during August 1979,
supported ideas like training courses, production of
information management tools such as national union
lists of serials, Index Medicus for the South-East Asia
Region (IMSEAR), collaboration with the Health Systems
Research (HSR) network and links with the ESCAPPOPIN [Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP)–Population Information Network].
The budget for these activities was originally from intercountry funds, later from their country budgets for their
HELLIS activities. Some of the member countries have
dropped national HELLIS activities from their country
budgets.
HELLIS network followed cooperative and distributed
approach instead of centralised approach for sharing
resources among medical and health libraries in the
region thereby strengthening each other. The coverage of
information resources includes various subjects such as
Ayurveda and indigenous medicine, primary healthcare,
community health, nutrition, population information,
nursing, environment, drug information and health
education, etc. [7], whereas WHO American Region,
established a Regional Library of Medicine and Health
Sciences (BIREME), at the Paulista Medicine School in
Sao Paulo, Brazil, extended service through regional
libraries as a centralised approach to serve countries in
Latin America [2].

HELLIS—A SERVICE MODEL

Majority of the technology-based consortia (buy and
share model) are to buy collectively and share among the
paid member libraries, which are conditioned by
commercial terms of publishers. Whereas the HELLIS
network as national plan and in its service, looks at
effective sharing of resource irrespective of buying power
of each individual library or individual professional in the
region. HELLIS considered sharing of resources as a
culture irrespective of size of library/users, budget,
affordability, technology infrastructure and expertise.
HELLIS network, as a service model, has developed
strategic plans for community participation, such as
involving users in decision making and management,
14

identifying experts in various aspects of service at local,
national and international level. Many experts are involved
to scrutinise new research initiatives for avoiding
duplication; to disseminate information relating to newer
methodologies; to disseminate latest case studies and
best practice to support better output of research. The
network has compiled many inter-country case studies
on teamwork, which were used for stimulating a chain of
comparable studies in their own countries for improving
the delivery of health care services at the community
level. HELLIS as a service model aimed ultimately to
support the mission ‘health of all people’ to:


Integrate information system in health education.



Establish a partnership between health services on
the one hand and the individual, the family and the
community on the other.



Support educational approach in addition to informing
and motivating the people.



Enable community to take appropriate actions as
well as generate self-help and self-reliance.



Support preparation and dissemination of appropriate
learning aids.



Integrate information component as an essential
components of the overall educational activities.



Identify, collect, organise, and evaluate education
and research materials.

The HELLIS network, being inter-country ‘network of
networks’ is aimed at promoting exchange of views/
experiences among member libraries thereby examining
situations in their own countries in the light of the
experiences of the entire group and to identify measures
to solve the problems. The network has built-in-culture to
review and realign many services, to deploy technology
effectively; build and preserve collection; enhance the
strength and expansion of consortia; foster and initiate
strategic and collaborative partnerships; promote and
support initiatives for more affordable scholarly publishing.
HELLIS as a culture, created flexible organisational
structures to realise service goals and ensure the most
effective use of resources including enhancement of
library facilities as outreach and attractive venues for
study, research and interaction.

HELLIS INTEGRATED TO HFA, IEH, HSR

The HELLIS network is integrated to programs such
as Health For All (HFA) and Health Service Research
(HSR) and Information Education for Health (IEH), wherein
HELLIS has gained importance due to information support
to HFA, IEH and HSR programs. HELLIS has created an
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

opportunity for health librarians to participate in the
activities like policy formulation, programming, budgeting,
implementation and evaluation of programs like HFA.
Information has been recognised as a strong component
in IEH program to translate social skills into educational
objectives; to promote individual and community
involvement; self-reliance; strengthening mutli-sectoral
approaches; monitoring and evaluation [6]. HFA planned
to have more information channels to reach wide sections
of the people, in fact to cover all the community members
irrespective of socio-economic or psychosocial aspects.
IEH is to inform and educate people in developing skills to
recognise, control, and solve their health problems.
Health education functionally, very largely, includes
production and dissemination of health education
materials, where staff includes librarians, media officers,
publicity officers, artists, photographers, visualiser’s and
so on. HFA has established linkages between the health
education bureaus and ministries of public information,
education, agriculture, women’s affairs etc., to foster the
relation between health care providers and community in
meeting the demand for a constant two-way flow of
information, where professionals from various sectors are
involved, such as health professionals, behavioral
scientists, educationists, information specialists and
mass media.
Information Education for Health (IEH) was later
called as Information Education Communication (IEC). In
context of promotion of IEC, HELLIS supported consumer
education materials and created a database for materials
either produced in their own countries or acquired from
external sources. The database covers document like
pamphlets, brochures, leaflets, visual materials, posters,
photographs, flash cards, AV materials, overhead
transperences, teaching and learning aids, game
puppets, role-play, exercises, etc. It also have proposed
the exchange of consumer education materials among
members of HELLIS to avoid duplication of efforts in
producing, organising and publishing IEC materials. In the
context public education, the network planned to identify,
collect, catalogue and develop directory of materials
available in member countries. Each record in directory
describes the purpose of these materials and annotates
the record about the success and failure.
The network of libraries collects, publishes and
distributes directory to both governmental and nongovernmental organisations; update the information
contained in directory from time to time; promote/
coordinate modification of the existing materials to suite
the local language and cultural requirement within the
country, duplicate suitable materials locally for
dissemination and use; and to identify the thrust areas or
gap in consumer education materials for further
development. HELLIS planned to develop regional
clearinghouse for collection and cataloguing of all relevant
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

information of IEC, such as reports of seminar, workshop,
meetings, group educational activity, directly and
indirectly related to IEC. Clearinghouse to undertake
documentation of IEC projects, success stories,
materials produced in other countries giving description of
use including list of each IEC research and their findings.
During 1980-1985 guidelines were developed for
standardisation of Health Service Research (HSR) in
assisting and coordinating research in multi-disciplinary
and multi-sectoral activities in developing countries. All
the guidelines and services were pre-tested in some
countries before implementation. The activities
considered are collection, processing, dissemination and
storage of HSR information on a continued basis in the
area. The very objective of HSR was to develop
appropriate technology for different aspects such as
primary health care; appropriate staffing pattern; training
modules for village health volunteers; modules for health
information system; operation research system and
develop manual for training management etc., HELLIS
network to capture the results of HSR and its utilisation at
the care level, which includes information for risk
approach, diagnosis and management, prenatal mortality
and low birth weight, community participation in the
utilisation of MCH and family planning services, breast
feeding patterns etc.

HELLIS—GOOD IN PLAN AND POOR IN
IMPLEMENTATION

HELLIS in its plan have many good decisions,
evolved through seminars and workshops, in its early
period development itself. They were aiming to:


Develop network of libraries (not just network of
resources) linking horisontally and vertically (to
create sharing as a culture and environment) so to
make the network to reach as near as possible and
easy access to users all over the country irrespective
of the location.



Fulfill the maximum needs by providing access to
international, national and local resources by
consolidating the native country information.



Develop HELLIS as an environment and a sharing
culture among libraries not just resources, also
responsibilities, expertise, experts and service/work
load.



Identify, accumulate, and consolidate national
information assets in their respective country
including union catalogue of holdings of all
participating and non-participating libraries/centres.



Make the resources sharing process a practical,
viable, and affordable.
15



Integrate information service to the process of
academic, research and practice including health
care system.



Strengthen and enhance the technical capability and
capacity of the libraries irrespective of the purchasing
power, size and location, affordability or technology
infrastructure and expertise.



Develop strategic plan for community participation by
involving users in decision making and management
by identifying experts in various aspects at local,
national and regional level including non-members
experts.



Extend the service through recognised “service
extension centers” as a part of the network, as near
as possible to grass root level.

The activities of the HELLIS network is neither visible
nor updated, looks it has remained as ritual of network for
the sake of utilising the money allotted since a decade,
particularly in India. HELLIS has failed to involve referral
centers (national institutes of different specialty in India)
and good libraries located in PG centers to strengthen the
network. The power of digital technology and web 2.0/web
3.0 capability is not utilised for building good social
network and interactive training programs for librarians.
There is very less effort from HELLIS network to share
resources, skill and transfer of technology or furthering
the activities. It has therefore given a way for creating
many small networks among libraries within the country
or alternative network/facility without involving HELLIS. In
fact the culture of HELLIS and power of technology have
been an ideal combination to strengthen the network in
the region, consolidation of native information, and
enabling libraries to attain equal strength irrespective of
the location and spending power of the libraries. HELLIS
is supposed to lead and enable librarians, health
administrators, decision-makers and researchers to
come together using virtual discussion and to formulate
strategies to strengthen the network for all the activities. It
also would have to strengthen services to clinicians,
academicians, research workers, administrators,
decision-makers,
health-related
personnel
and
consumer’s of health.
HELLIS was to build various activities to consolidate
it by building historical data, enabling strategic decisionmaking, benchmarking, and data submissions for peer
comparison including consolidation of expertise,
expenditures and library services. Of late, technologybased consortia and their collaborative members are
capturing data online from among the member libraries
including querying and extracting reports. The tools and
expertise available from among participating libraries are
to be selected and reviewed, rankings member
16

institutions by selected criteria, create graphs and to
generate summary statistics for all member libraries.
The cooperation among the technology-based
consortia have already initiated consolidation through a
web-based cataloguing and bibliographic records for local
information resources such as websites, e-books, ejournals and digitised materials. In preparing catalogue, it
is expected to use standards such as MARC21 structure
including the details of electronic location, access details
and MARC 856 fields. Librarians are to be familiar with
different types of tools and structure such as MARC21,
AACR2, GMDs and common bibliographic tags that are
suitable for cataloguing different types of resources
including physical media such as CD-ROMs and DVDROMs, online resources, e-books and e-journals,
websites and digitised materials.
In brief, HELLIS network formed in the year 1980,
have undergone several functional changes and
progressive planning on par with changing society and
share data through its portal www.hellis.org which was
launched in September 2003 [8]. The digital network has
changed the attitude of sharing of resources, leading to
automation by harvesting of metadata. It also has helped
repackaging and providing real time access to resources
including identification, clustering, and dissemination of
local information assets. National Medical Library (NML),
New Delhi is the National Focal Point, in India, was set up
in 1982, identified six Regional Medical Libraries (RML)
and eight Resource Libraries (RL) have been provided little
of grant-in-aid and equipments [9]. HELLIS is supposed to
assume the responsibility to satisfy information needs of
the users (policy makers, administrators, health care
workers, scientists and the general public), ultimately to
promote global health, is not just to buy and share.

8. CONCLUSION
The question arises in context of technology-based
consortia that Do we take it as granted that technology
helps to strengthen ties of libraries and enhance
resources/services, without social network, to meet the
maximum information needs all the health professionals
in the country. Otherwise is the technology helping
publishers to have control over their resources for their
perpetual revenue? It also looks that sharing of resources,
as a culture, does not suit to present terms and
conditions of publishers, as they have control over the
resources, copyright restriction and pricing based on FTE
(Full Time Enrollment). Open Access initiative, which
includes Institutional Repository, is a good move to
support and strengthen the library’s cooperation not just
resource access. In the present day’s advanced
technology and web 2.0/3.0 environments, it is very
helpful to develop network of hybrid library model, where
both print and electronic resources can be used to meet
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2009, 29(5)

the needs of all kind of users at various level. HELLIS is
an all time relevant consortia for inter-country
partnerships, to share experiences on development
processes, collaboration in research activities and
sharing their findings. It is also a cost saving approach for
health development in the region and accelerate the
information revolution. It is becoming important to invest
on technology and tools to cover all kind of resources
such as resources with fee, free, open access, and
subscribed access. Ultimately, in context of public
health, it is becoming urgent to achieve free flow of
information integrated to activities at grass root level.
HELLIS has not implemented majority of its decision
though it has very well planned and matured network over
the years.
